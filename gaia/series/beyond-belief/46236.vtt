people today don't

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.053 align:middle line:90%

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Bigfoot, the
large hairy ape-like creature

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:84%
also known as
Sasquatch, has always

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
seemed to allude
hunters and researchers.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what is this creature?

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Half man, half ape?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Alien in nature?

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.559 align:middle line:84%
What would it be like to
actually have one in captivity?

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, how about that?

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:10%
You know, Bigfoot we've talked
about on "Coast to Coast"

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:10%
for so many years
and, of course,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:10%
here on "Beyond
Belief," as well.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:10%
It's just been one
of those subjects

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:10%
that everybody's
fascinated with.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:10%
And today we have a
special guest for you,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:10%
an expert on Bigfoot
research, Rhettman Mullis.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:10%
His organization is
called Bigfootology.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.299 align:middle line:10%
They are expert researchers.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.590 align:middle line:10%
Rhettman, always a pleasure
to have you on the program.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:10%
>>RHETTMAN MULLIS: Thank you.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.110 align:middle line:10%
Good to see you again, George.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
interested in Sasquatch?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.364 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoot?

00:01:14.364 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Purely accidental.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
When I was nine years old, we
moved to the Pacific Northwest.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.010 align:middle line:10%
In '76, my dad was stationed
at Whidbey Naval Air Station.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:10%
And '77, during the summer, we
took a ferry ride from Seattle

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:10%
to Victoria.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:10%
And as we were passing on the
west coast of Whidbey Island,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:10%
in the Admiralty
inlet area, I was

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:10%
standing on the back of a
ferry, just kind of catching

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.284 align:middle line:10%
the beauty of the area and
someone started saying,

00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:41.450 align:middle line:10%
hey, what's that over there?

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Is that a whale?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.445 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody started
focusing their attention

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:84%
at the back to the ferry
upon that observation deck.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
exchanging comments

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and the guy goes, if it's
a whale, it's got arms.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.507 align:middle line:90%
And we focused in on it.

00:01:57.507 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:84%
It was the biggest
man we'd ever seen.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was swimming across
the wake of the ferry--

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Swimming?

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: --heading
towards Whidbey island.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first time
I'd even-- somebody goes,

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of
those Bigfoot things.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even heard of a Bigfoot
because I grew up basically

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:90%
in the desert.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.963 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:15.026 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: And it was after that,
I started learning about it

00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:90%
and reading about it.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And it just evolved
into this now 37,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
38 years of doing
research in addition to

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
living a regular
life of what I do.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My first
exposure was when

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I started reading about
the abominable snowman.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:90%
The Yeti.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to talk
about this creature having

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.446 align:middle line:90%
a lot of furry, white hair.

00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
we've got Bigfoot.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.497 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about the
same species basically?

00:02:41.497 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: It's the same species.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Probably a different
sub-species.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But the actual interesting
thing is the abominable snowman,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
or the Yeti, they actually
have the same colorization

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.084 align:middle line:84%
of hair as all the
other Bigfoots.

00:02:54.084 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:84%
What people don't
understand, it's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.704 align:middle line:84%
just like with humans, we have
a vast array of body types,

00:03:00.704 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
you know ectomorphic,
endomorphic.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:90%
We have hair colorations.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:84%
We have auburn, black,
the two I've seen up close

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:90%
were black haired.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of auburn hair.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
There are some white
haired ones out there

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that are more
indicative of, say,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
a greying gorilla or maybe
some kind of albinoism.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So there is that
spectrum of colorization.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
the Yetis are actually

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:90%
the typical color of a Bigfoot.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's an ongoing
theory that they

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.180 align:middle line:84%
crossed over the
Bering Bridge just

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
like the rest of the
Denisovan branches

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
that came into the new
world long before the Bering

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.414 align:middle line:84%
Bridge collapsed
or went underwater.

00:03:45.414 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're with
this group, Bigfootology,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and there are other good
researching groups out there.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.411 align:middle line:84%
You folks take this pretty
darned seriously, don't you?

00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: Well, in all the years
that we've been doing this,

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
the greatest amount
of criticism I

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
saw was that the
scientific world was not

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:90%
willing to take this seriously.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, I became a scientist.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.750 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm a behavioral scientist.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we learned

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to do in the
scientific world is how

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.712 align:middle line:84%
to address problems using a
multi-disciplinary approach.

00:04:16.712 --> 00:04:18.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we pull
a whole bunch of people

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
together with
certain specialties

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and we focus on the problem
and find a solution.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:84%
This is why it used
to be originally back

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.340 align:middle line:84%
in the late '80s,
it was SIR Bigfoot,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Sasquatch
Investigative Research.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:84%
That was my little
research group.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.075 align:middle line:84%
And then as I continued
my education and evolved,

00:04:39.075 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I
have the ability

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
to take this into
the science realm.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:10%
And so that's when
we switched over

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:10%
to Bigfootology which is
the study of the Bigfoot

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.390 align:middle line:10%
phenomenon.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:10%
And with that, we brought onto
the team, we have a zoologist,

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:10%
we have Dr. Bryan
Sykes, a geneticist,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:10%
he's part of team Bigfootology.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Anna Nekaris
is a primatologist,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:90%
she's a part of Bigfootology.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these scientists
that are part of this

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're all using
our expertises in order

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.026 align:middle line:84%
to address the
evidence that's there

00:05:13.026 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and come up with a
reasonable solution.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.185 align:middle line:84%
One our main project's is coming
up with the species profile.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Which is why we've
been doing the DNA--

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: DNA testing, sure.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.926 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: And we have
some other projects

00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:84%
that we're actually
dealing with.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Like there's a common story
among indigenous tribes

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
of maidens being
kidnapped, impregnated,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, that's
been well documented.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
So we are also
investigating that.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Is there any truth?

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.937 align:middle line:84%
And we've actually tested three
claimed hybrids right now--

00:05:46.937 --> 00:05:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they look like?

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: --looking for two
more to test those as well,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and to see if there's any
evidence truly of that.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's not them saying,
oh, I'm part Bigfoot.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
No, it's actually the
tribal history saying well,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.920 align:middle line:84%
they have Bigfoot
in their heritage.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Their great, great
grandmother was kidnapped.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:90%
And so we're testing that.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.409 align:middle line:90%
We're still doing more DNA work.

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have other
projects that we're

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.520 align:middle line:90%
working behind the scenes.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And in science, we
don't put ourselves out

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
there in terms of
every day updating.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.134 align:middle line:84%
Because people are
very impatient.

00:06:20.134 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So in true science, what
you do, you do all the work

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes, and then when
you have something to report,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:90%
you report it.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we deliberately
don't talk

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
about a lot of these projects in
the open arena because we don't

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.449 align:middle line:84%
want to be inundated, what's
going on, how you doing,

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:34.240 align:middle line:90%
that type of thing.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: And that's
the way it should work.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.644 align:middle line:84%
That we were
unencumbered to make sure

00:06:37.644 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:84%
we do our work
effectively and according

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:84%
to the different processes
that we need to do.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do these
so-called hybrids look like?

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: Well, it
depends on how closely

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
they are in terms
of the pairing.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: What got me interested
in the hybrids is back in 1987,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I was working for a
company and I had a man

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and woman-- different
people, different times--

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
come in and in conversation
it would come up.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I supposedly have
Bigfoot in my ancestry.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.704 align:middle line:90%
The woman was very unremarkable.

00:07:11.704 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, she
didn't have anything

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:90%
out of the extraordinary.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:84%
The man, however, he
was six foot eight,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:90%
had the prominent brow.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.189 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.859 align:middle line:90%
The thin lips.

00:07:20.859 --> 00:07:21.400 align:middle line:90%
He scared me.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.627 align:middle line:84%
I have a funny story
about that, but I

00:07:22.627 --> 00:07:24.502 align:middle line:84%
don't think we have time
to share that today.

00:07:24.502 --> 00:07:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But he screamed
Bigfoot, but there

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.322 align:middle line:84%
was no way to prove or
support his claim back then.

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But now that we have
the DNA technology--

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.782 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now there is, sure.

00:07:38.782 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: --we can.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, I have no idea
where those people are.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But we do have, through
some of the tribes that we

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
work with, the tribes have
come forward and said, test,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:84%
look at this person,
look at this.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And so we've gone in and we've
done the whole DNA twelve.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:84%
I've done the videos
and the photographs

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and documented them, done
physical measurements.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And in those cases, their
great, great, great grandmothers

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.930 align:middle line:90%
have the pairing.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And two of the cases
you looked at them

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and you go, nothing really
remarkable about them.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.130 align:middle line:84%
There's some traits about
them that are interesting.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Like their proclivity
for extreme cold.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.508 align:middle line:84%
They walk around barefoot
even in a foot of snow and ice

00:08:20.508 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.492 align:middle line:84%
They prefer swimming in ice
cold water and ice cold lakes.

00:08:24.492 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:84%
They have certain
things like that.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is unusual.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:90%
That's unusual.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: But we did
test the last person

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:90%
we just tested back in November.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
He's about my height, but
when he shakes your hand,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
it's like you're
shaking a boxing glove.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
His feet are, he's
got a 6E wide foot

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.930 align:middle line:84%
even though it's only
about 11 inch foot.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And he has more of
the facial features.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.587 align:middle line:84%
So he may have actually a closer
pairing in terms of distance.

00:08:55.587 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean if you looked
at him, Rhettman, on the street,

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.219 align:middle line:90%
would you say, whoa!

00:09:00.219 --> 00:09:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: You'd go,
well, that's a big boy.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:02.593 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:02.593 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: OK.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.124 align:middle line:84%
And we're not just
talking about weight wise.

00:09:05.124 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
in terms of width.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: And that's
two of the quote

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:84%
unquote hybrids
that we've tested

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
had an extra amount of
width to their torso.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.151 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has a dimensional
side to their head,

00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:84%
but their head seemed
a little bit smaller

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:84%
compared to the
width of their torso.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: And, again, we're
not talking about the fact

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:90%
that they're obese.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:29.800 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
they're just really wide.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.310 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite abnormal.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I can't give you
their entire names,

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.192 align:middle line:84%
but Dell is the
last one we tested,

00:09:40.192 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and he was a very, very
interesting individual.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.774 align:middle line:84%
We're really, really
curious about him.

00:09:43.774 --> 00:09:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since the beginning
of time or registered time,

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:84%
what have been the
past Bigfoot stories?

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:90%
What's the history of Bigfoot?

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: Well, that's
actually, again,

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:90%
we have several projects.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the projects
that we're doing

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is documenting the
historicity of Bigfoot.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I came out with a theory
back in the early '90s

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that when we start looking
at the anecdotal evidence

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and start pulling
out themes, which

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.690 align:middle line:84%
is how we do
anthropological work,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:90%
we do the qualitative work.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.230 align:middle line:84%
We take all these
stories and then

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:84%
we start pulling
out consistencies.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And that creates our theme or
our trend in data that says,

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is things that
we could pretty much bet

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.717 align:middle line:90%
is a fact about them.

00:10:21.717 --> 00:10:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I started pulling
out all the behavioral stuff,

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:84%
because that's what I do, and I
started going back into history

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and reading basic concept things
like the old nursery rhymes.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can learn about
werewolves and trolls and ogres

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and their traits
and their behaviors.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:90%
They match.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I came up
with this theory

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:84%
that they've existed
throughout time.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just like there are over
1,000 names of these things

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
around the world in
different tribes.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
We've lost the concept
of their existence

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:84%
because we no longer think
of them anymore in terms

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
of the boogeyman
and the wild man.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Like the old nursery rhymes
where the momma would say,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.690 align:middle line:84%
don't go out in the woods or
the boogeyman will get you.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was about the
Bigfoot and what they do.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:13.052 align:middle line:84%
And so back in '96, '97, I
came across a gentleman named

00:11:13.052 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Scott White, who we've been
trying to find all these years,

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:90%
we have yet to find him.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But he put together this
compendium of artifacts

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:90%
from around the world.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Drawings, paintings,
architectural reliefs,

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
carvings of all these
very hairy wild men.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:10%
And they were
traditionally known

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:10%
as wild men or woodwose,
and stuff like that.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:10%
So he has all this evidence
that we put together.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.390 align:middle line:10%
And we also have a team
historian, Pearl Prihoda,

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.990 align:middle line:10%
that still works with us now.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:10%
And she does a
marvelous job doing

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:10%
what he was doing, as well.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we literally have
thousands of thousands

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:84%
of these artifacts showing their
existence throughout history,

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:84%
including the wars
that we've had.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:10%
Like you have an
image right there

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.790 align:middle line:10%
on the screen of a knight
with a Bigfoot in captivity.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:10%
You also had images in
the very beginning where

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.950 align:middle line:10%
you showed one of the
battles between Bigfoot.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:90%
That was from 1550, 1551.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.847 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:16.847 --> 00:12:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: My favorite is--

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're fighting
a whole group of them.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.746 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: Yeah, the
whole group of them.

00:12:20.746 --> 00:12:24.100 align:middle line:84%
This, if I recall correctly,
comes out of France.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:84%
My favorite one is from Hans
Berkmeier from 1500 to 1503.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And he did a wood relief carving
of a knight in full battle

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.770 align:middle line:84%
against what is
obviously a Bigfoot.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And the common portrayal
throughout all that time

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.600 align:middle line:84%
is you see Bigfoots
usually with clubs.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's even in our
modern day stories of Bigfoot

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.630 align:middle line:84%
with the different
indigenous tribes,

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:84%
they still tend to
have clubs if they're

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.390 align:middle line:84%
going into some kind
of combative situation

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.224 align:middle line:90%
or threatening pose.

00:12:53.224 --> 00:12:54.723 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which tells
you there's got

00:12:54.723 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:84%
to be some intelligence
behind these things.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.141 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: There is
some intelligence.

00:12:58.141 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And that brought about another
theory that I had about how--

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and the theories were reinforced
by what Pearl was finding

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:90%
and what Scott White had found.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Because as we start going into
our chronological portrayal

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:84%
of a these images, of these
carvings and stuff like that,

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:84%
what we see is the homo
sapiens slash Neanderthal

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and the Denisovan branches
grew in intelligence.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:84%
These stayed in their
primitive state.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's through
the nonability to

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.859 align:middle line:84%
progress more
intelligently or not.

00:13:31.859 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:84%
They stayed in their
primitive state.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And over time we separated.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
As homo sapiens and Denisovans
became more intelligent

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and they started
cloistering into their towns

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and their cities and
their fortresses,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:90%
they stayed on the outside.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And what we see in a
lot of these images,

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and I only sent
you a few of them,

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:84%
but like I said we
have thousands of them,

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
we can see how they get into
these melees, these battles,

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And where they've been
captured and killed.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.246 align:middle line:84%
There's another
excellent example,

00:13:58.246 --> 00:13:59.943 align:middle line:90%
and this one comes out of Rome.

00:13:59.943 --> 00:14:01.193 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's unusual.

00:14:01.193 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean how many Bigfoot were
involved in the battles?

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Hundreds of them?

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Ten?

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Singles?

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any number.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:07.848 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any idea.

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't know that.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: And it's impossible
to even number them today.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we have theories,
but that's all we have.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a set
way of nailing down.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So we can see how, over time,
the main construct of humanity

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.730 align:middle line:84%
progressed knowledge-wise
and these remained primitive.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we've lost that
knowledge of their existence.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Even though we
have, when we start

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
looking at the historical
evidence, it's there.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.410 align:middle line:90%
It's there in droves.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Even in terms of writing.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
The Romans documented
them, their existence,

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:90%
going back 2000 plus years ago.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare wrote about them
and, I mean, I could sit here

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and just-- I'd have to look
at my notes at this point

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.425 align:middle line:90%
because there's just so much.

00:14:58.425 --> 00:15:00.722 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've been in
folklore, you name it.

00:15:00.722 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Exactly

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're there.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.565 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Yeah.

00:15:02.565 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:10%
So I think the problem is
that, in our modern society,

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:10%
we're so focused on what
I call being auto-centric,

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.830 align:middle line:10%
we're focused on ourselves that
we don't look at our history.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.039 align:middle line:10%
And so we lose that.

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's only a few people
that actually do-- like myself,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Pearl, Scott White, for
example, and other people

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
who actually have
a love for history.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Around this
country, there's

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:84%
an individual who claims
he has shot a Bigfoot,

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and he claims that
he's got him on display

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and he's got him in
a little RV and he's

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:84%
driving around trying to charge
people to go in and see that.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.530 align:middle line:84%
This individual was
involved in an obvious hoax

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:90%
several years ago.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.309 align:middle line:84%
Does that hurt serious
Bigfoot research

00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
when something like
that is going on?

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Incredibly.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And because Bigfoot is the only
global scientific organization,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.584 align:middle line:84%
we have to take each
situation as it comes.

00:15:56.584 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:84%
We just can't say,
well, he was involved

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.159 align:middle line:84%
in 2008 hoax where he put
a Bigfoot in a freezer--

00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And just throw it out.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: --throw him out.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.568 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

00:16:03.568 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:84%
We have a look at
it subjectively.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:06.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, objectively.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when that
came about, we were

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.600 align:middle line:84%
notified of that within
a week of it happening.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:90%
The actual shooting.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.082 align:middle line:84%
And we tried to work with
it behind the scenes.

00:16:17.082 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
We had four of our
different team members

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
working including one
of our team members

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.660 align:middle line:90%
working directly with him.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And because we're also in
the middle of a DNA project,

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.940 align:middle line:84%
we were trying to
get a hair sample.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dr. Sykes, yeah.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.599 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: And as soon
as he found out--

00:16:35.599 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:84%
because I was actually talking
to him directly at one point--

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.107 align:middle line:84%
and he found out what we were
trying to do, he shut up.

00:16:42.107 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And he wouldn't talk
to us after that.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't want to give
you any more info on it.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:45.886 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Right.

00:16:45.886 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we continued to work
behind the scenes and even

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
the person that was working
directly with him offered him

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:84%
all this equipment and, you
know, just for the hair sample.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:90%
But he still refused that.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just harder
to believe that you

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.252 align:middle line:84%
would have the find of the
millennia in a trailer--

00:17:06.252 --> 00:17:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And not let the
world want to know about it.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Right.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Other than a caravan
where you charge people.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: Yeah, we
actually have an agreement

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:84%
in our organization that we
do not believe in exploiting.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:90%
We're here to document.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:84%
And if we ever had a
situation like this

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:25.830 align:middle line:84%
where there was a carcass,
the analysis would be done.

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:84%
We don't believe
in killing Bigfoot;

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:90%
that's not our point, but--

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you kill Bigfoot
if you were being attacked?

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Well, anybody would.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course,
that's self defense.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: You have to choose
your life over theirs.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's different.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.948 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: So you have
to defend yourself.

00:17:36.948 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we came up
with the Bigfootology creed.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Talking about protecting
our researchers,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
protecting those
who are with us,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:84%
as well as protecting the
species in their habitat.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to document
in a nonlethal way.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.390 align:middle line:90%
And that makes it even harder.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.130 align:middle line:84%
But we do have,
and I can't really

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:84%
talk about these other projects
because it'll reveal too much,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:84%
but we have some very
aggressive projects happening.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Not aggressive violence
wise, but aggressive in terms

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:84%
of if we can make these
projects come to fruition,

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:90%
it'll put the lid on this.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you ever ran into
this individual with his RV,

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.700 align:middle line:90%
would you tell him off?

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.587 align:middle line:90%
Would you be upset?

00:18:13.587 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:90%
How would you handle that?

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.503 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: No, I don't
treat people that way.

00:18:16.503 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
What I would do is I would
sit there and ask him, OK, I'm

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I'll put my gloves on.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:90%
I've got an artifact bag.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Let me have a sample.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's put this to rest.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, which is
the fair thing to do.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Yeah, it is.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't turn around-- you're
in the middle of a DNA project

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:84%
with the top
geneticist in the world

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:40.630 align:middle line:84%
with even the top wildlife
lab working with you,

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and you don't sit
there and go, well,

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:47.257 align:middle line:84%
I can't give you evidence
because-- you know, why not?

00:18:47.257 --> 00:18:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The only way you don't do
that is you disprove it.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:84%
There's another person
named Justin Schmidt who

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
shot two Bigfoots back
in northern California.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And Brian and I
interviewed him at length

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:90%
as well as took samples.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.057 align:middle line:84%
And people say
that he's hoaxing.

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't believe so.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if he was, he
would not have put himself

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:90%
on the line to have it tested.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And he did admit early
on that it was likely

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:84%
bear because of the time frame
in which it was retrieved.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:90%
The stake was retrieved.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.957 align:middle line:84%
And the fact it is a
prolific bear hunting area.

00:19:17.957 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: So he admitted
upfront that it's possibly bear.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.925 align:middle line:84%
And we did test it
and it was bear.

00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a bear.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: But if
you're a hoaxer--

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he decomposing?

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: --you're going to do
what this other gentleman, Mr.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Dyer, is doing.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is avoid any kind of
intangible or tangible evidence

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
show that it's fake.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So all he had to do is clip
one hair, send it to us.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:43.120 align:middle line:84%
We would have analyzed it
and said, you've got him.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:90%
You've got the golden goose.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Or what we call the golden hair.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.581 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's going on with
the DNA of Dr. Bryan Sykes?

00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Still working on it.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.882 align:middle line:90%
The paper is in peer review.

00:19:52.882 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:84%
It has been for a
little while now.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But the tests are done?

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: We're actually
starting to do more testing.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So we were able to accomplish a
lot with Dr. Bryan Sykes' help.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful guy.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
We were able to figure out what
one of the Yeti samples were.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:90%
The hybrid extinct polar bear.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The problem that
people misunderstand

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:84%
is there's three types
of words for Yeti.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And we always suspected that one
of them was a form of a bear.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Which is the deksu,
something like that.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gigantopithecus.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.769 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: Well,
gigantopithecus is actually a--

00:20:32.769 --> 00:20:34.143 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
monkey, isn't it?

00:20:34.143 --> 00:20:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: --extinct monkey.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Extinct great ape.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it the skunk monkey?

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: The skunk ape is a
form of Bigfoot out of Florida.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And they just call them skunk
apes because they smell.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, most all Bigfoots
smell really bad.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.552 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: Just like humans
smell really bad, too,

00:20:47.552 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:90%
if it wasn't for showers--

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You stay out in the
woods for all these years.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: They're getting funky.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So, but they don't shower,
they don't use deodorant,

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.762 align:middle line:84%
so they're going
to smell and they

00:20:56.762 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
don't have any really
way of wiping themselves,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:90%
so it gets nasty.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But I've been around
smells that'll

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.600 align:middle line:90%
just make your eyes water.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%
But no, going back
to the DNA stuff,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
we are working with some
other organizations too,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:90%
genetic labs, and stuff.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.490 align:middle line:84%
We're still in the process of
doing more genetic testing.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it
sounds like you're

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:84%
trying to double-check
something.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.925 align:middle line:84%
Are you at liberty to
tell us anything yet?

00:21:23.925 --> 00:21:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Well, no.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.296 align:middle line:84%
It's just, we're
really not trying

00:21:26.296 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to double-check because
we're just still considering

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:90%
all the possibilities.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.832 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that we
found the answer to was Zana.

00:21:36.832 --> 00:21:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Zana was one of the greatest
mysteries in the Bigfoot world

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:84%
because everybody thought
she was a Bigfoot.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And she was the woman
captured about 120 odd years

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.420 align:middle line:84%
ago out of Georgia,
which is Russia.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:90%
On the border of Russia there.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And she was held in
captivity for three years.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And then finally she stayed
within the village after that.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:84%
She was impregnated six times by
villagers over drinking games.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And she had all
the characteristics

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.860 align:middle line:84%
of what we would
consider a Bigfoot.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was she a hairy woman?

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: She was a hairy woman.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Large woman.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:14.381 align:middle line:84%
Dark in skin color
and Dr. Igor Burtsev,

00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:15.630 align:middle line:90%
he did a lot of that research.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:84%
He even found her
offsprings and the graves

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
from her original offspring
as well as living offspring.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:90%
And we tested them.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.531 align:middle line:84%
And found that they
were just human.

00:22:24.531 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.571 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: So, but
what's interesting,

00:22:26.571 --> 00:22:28.280 align:middle line:90%
but there's a caveat there.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.080 align:middle line:10%
The caveat is that
Zana is actually

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.377 align:middle line:10%
a sub-Saharan African woman
which in the Ottoman Empire,

00:22:36.377 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:10%
they brought a lot of slaves up.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:10%
Which means that she is
a form of relic hominid.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:10%
And what Bryan's
trying to do now

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:10%
is figure a way to
determine how old,

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:10%
what the relic nature of that
sub-Saharan African strain is.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:10%


00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:10%
So we don't think that
she's a Bigfoot, in terms

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.580 align:middle line:10%
of what we know as Bigfoot now.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.780 align:middle line:84%
We just know that she's a human,
even if it's a relic human.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:84%
But that's part of
the whole mystery.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're trying to
determine what Bigfoot is.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And we may have that DNA
evidence that says they are

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.760 align:middle line:84%
a form of the sub-species or
sub-genus of human or maybe

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.260 align:middle line:90%
they're--

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.634 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could be the
missing link, for all we know.

00:23:19.634 --> 00:23:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Well--

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Between ape and
man, maybe you have Bigfoot.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: Well there's just
too many human qualities

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.130 align:middle line:84%
for there to be
categorized strictly ape.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.394 align:middle line:84%
But then again, we humans
are considered apes too.

00:23:31.394 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what if
it's right in the middle?

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: No, so
far what we've seen

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:90%
doesn't reflect any of that.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But that's, again, what
we're trying to do here.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.465 align:middle line:84%
A true scientist
says, I'm not going

00:23:41.465 --> 00:23:43.530 align:middle line:84%
to tell you what
I want it to be.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you what
the current theory is and then

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:84%
change that theory or
that system of knowledge

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:90%
based off of new evidence.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why science is
constantly changing anyway.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.379 align:middle line:84%
Because when new evidence comes
forth and they analyze it,

00:23:59.379 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:84%
we say, OK, well,
this is how we need

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.831 align:middle line:84%
to adjust what our current
thinking is on this.

00:24:04.831 --> 00:24:06.372 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
we can-- and I know

00:24:06.372 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
it frustrates a lot of
people when we can't say,

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:84%
it is 100% this,
or it is 100% that.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People want
their answers, don't they?

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: They want
their definitive answers

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:90%
and we can't do that.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:90%
It's just not possible.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:22.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
truly as a Bigfoot expert.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:10%
There's experts in
their field that

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.810 align:middle line:10%
have learned a lot about it and
they may have more knowledge

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:28.620 align:middle line:10%
about Bigfoot than,
say, the common person.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So that would
technically classify them

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
as some kind of
expert, but to say

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.050 align:middle line:84%
with 100% saying
I know everything

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
about Bigfoot, that's
just impossible to do.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:47.191 align:middle line:84%
The reality is for every
10,000 good stories we have,

00:24:47.191 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I saw Bigfoot here and
I saw Bigfoot there

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and they were walking away,
we do get occasional stories

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:84%
where they've ripped a human
to pieces or they killed them.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.493 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:24:56.493 --> 00:24:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MULLIS: Oh yeah.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, I worked as a
therapist and I was actually

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.890 align:middle line:84%
able to confirm one story where
a couple had gotten killed

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and the ranger went up and
retrieved the daughter.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:84%
She's still institutionalized
to this day.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And we don't talk about those
stores because they're so rare.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.795 align:middle line:84%
And why we don't talk
about those stories

00:25:13.795 --> 00:25:16.927 align:middle line:84%
is because Hollywood likes
to sensationalize things.

00:25:16.927 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And so they're making
all these movies

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.840 align:middle line:84%
painting these things to
be these scary creatures

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and really most of
them are just docile.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:90%
They'll leave you alone.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And just like running
into a bear in the woods,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.020 align:middle line:84%
a bear is going to avoid you,
but if they feel cornered

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Provoked?

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:32.936 align:middle line:90%
They're going to fight back.

00:25:32.936 --> 00:25:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: In the case
of Justin Schmidt,

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.625 align:middle line:84%
the female did a
territorial charge at him.

00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, stepping forward and
making an aggressive stance,

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.265 align:middle line:90%
which is why he shot at it.

00:25:44.265 --> 00:25:46.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a very common thing.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
One of our team
members, Tom Graham,

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.370 align:middle line:90%
he works out of southern Oregon.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:57.270 align:middle line:84%
He came across a white Bigfoot,
and it did a territorial charge

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:57.770 align:middle line:90%
at him.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:02.004 align:middle line:84%
Think gorilla in terms of their
behavior, in that respect.

00:26:02.004 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the other things

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.340 align:middle line:84%
I've done throughout
the last 37 years.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I find a certain
trend in behavior, what I do

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.980 align:middle line:84%
is I go into the rest
of the animal world

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and I look for those
behaviors in other species.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Like hunting behavior,
that type of thing.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've been able to find and
make sense of their behavior

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.760 align:middle line:90%
by using that behavior.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.910 align:middle line:84%
For example, there were
quite a few stories

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:84%
of them hunting in terms of
when they do a group hunt,

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.269 align:middle line:84%
they'll have drivers, guides,
and then the kill team.

00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's pretty unusual.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:84%
That shows a lot of
high intelligence.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smart.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: But then again,
I watched Discovery Channel

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:84%
back in the late '90s, early
2000, somewhere in that time.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And they had a documentary
about chimpanzees

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:48.090 align:middle line:84%
that did the exact same
thing with other monkeys.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's your
example right there.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:84%
That helps legitimize
that current trend

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
of data saying this
is a possibility.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.404 align:middle line:84%
You couple that with all the
deer kills in the fall, where

00:26:58.404 --> 00:27:00.570 align:middle line:84%
they're bulking up and they
eat all the deer livers.

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So all you find is deer with--
they'll jab their thumb up

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.120 align:middle line:84%
into their ribcage and
pull out their liver.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rip it off.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.164 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: And that
way because the liver

00:27:09.164 --> 00:27:11.080 align:middle line:84%
is so full of nutrients,
it helps them bulk up

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:90%
for the winter time.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So we start finding all
these things that slowly

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.770 align:middle line:84%
come together and produce
this nice picture.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why I always
tell people, all of us

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.720 align:middle line:90%
have pieces of the puzzle.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:84%
This is why no matter how
far fetched the story may be,

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:90%
you need to listen to it.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you may find that
little nugget that makes sense.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:84%
It helps create
this greater picture

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.230 align:middle line:90%
of what these things really are.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's all that's been
driving me for 37 years.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
believe they exist

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:90%
because I know they exist.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:41.905 align:middle line:90%
I've seen them twice.

00:27:41.905 --> 00:27:44.640 align:middle line:10%
And I have a couple of
other types of interactions

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:10%
throughout the years,
being stuff thrown at me.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.200 align:middle line:10%
And calling back and
forth, and stuff like that.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.480 align:middle line:10%
That's old stuff.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.050 align:middle line:10%
But what is interesting,
what drives me,

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.980 align:middle line:10%
is not if they exist,
but what are they?

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:10%
Which is why I decided to use
what science I'm involved in

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:10%
and help bring
other scientists in

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:10%
to take that serious approach.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, maybe one
day you'll get the answer.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Rhettman, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:10.573 align:middle line:84%
>>MULLIS: Thank you
very much, George.

00:28:10.573 --> 00:28:12.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The subject of Bigfoot.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:14.370 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely fascinating.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:10%
Will we ever find the creature?

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Only time will tell.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:19.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.798 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
