00:00:17.808 --> 00:00:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.305 align:middle line:10%
Courtney McInvale is with
us, a former FBI analyst

00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
and she worked
for the Department

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:10%
of Homeland Security.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:84%

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Courtney, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COURTNEY MCINVALE: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How in
the world did you

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:84%
go from being an FBI
analyst to somebody

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:90%
interested in haunted tours?

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:10%
>>MCINVALE: I would say
that, actually, my interest

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.340 align:middle line:10%
in the paranormal and haunted
history came before my job

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:10%
with the government.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.290 align:middle line:10%
I grew up in a house that had
a lot of haunting activity,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:10%
and I was always sort of
searching for answers for what

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:10%
had happened there and why.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And so working
for the government

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and putting together
puzzle pieces,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.797 align:middle line:84%
coincided nicely with that sort
of research part of my brain.

00:01:11.797 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You must have had a
passion for the paranormal.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
What started this for you?

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: So when
I grew up, I grew up

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:84%
in a house in a small
town in Connecticut

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:84%
that had a lot of activity
that was inexplicable.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And then as I got older, the
activity got kind of dark.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
For a variety of reasons
there was a dark energy

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:90%
that seemed to happen.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up when
I was a teenager,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
that my mom called Ed and
Lorraine Warren to come

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:90%
to the house and check it out.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Giants in
the field, Giants.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Giants,
yes, yes, but we

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:90%
didn't know that at the time.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:84%
We were kind of just
suffering this haunting,

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, without
any knowledge of what

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:90%
to do about it.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot
going on in our family.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when someone told
my mom that Ed and Lorraine

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Warren lived in Connecticut,
and they were Catholic like us,

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.453 align:middle line:84%
and they did ghost hunting,
she immediately called them.

00:02:04.453 --> 00:02:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us more.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: So it started
off, when I was growing up,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
just like I call
an old New England

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:84%
haunting with creaky
floorboards or doorknobs

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:90%
jiggling or flickering lights.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And my mother would just say,
old houses do strange things.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was never anything
too spooky or scary,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
just evidence that perhaps
people had lived there before.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not too
shocking, right?

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.313 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: No, and
it wasn't anything

00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
that made us lose sleep at
night or anything like that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and you know, so maybe just
the idea that an old house had

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:90%
little bits of the past left.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was
a teenager, there

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
was a lot going
on with my family.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
My father was suffering from
different health conditions,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:84%
mental health, and him and
my mother were separating.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was working a job
called postmortem cleanup

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
where he was cleaning
up homicide and suicide.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, what
a horrible job.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah, he was
a police officer before.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So he felt like he could kind
of handle that sort of thing.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he
couldn't, could he?

00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I think that a
darkness maybe found something

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:90%
inside him during that time.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: And that's
when the activity really

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:90%
escalated at the house.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So I always tell people it's
a perfect storm of events.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up very close
to both my parents.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely saw a change
in my dad at that time.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And we started to
have activity that

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:84%
was more things like there
was weird sort of blood

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.968 align:middle line:90%
on the wall, furniture moving.

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Blood on the wall,
just appeared from nowhere?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Out of nowhere.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And other people
witnessed it, not just me.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
My poor mother was
so worried about us,

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:84%
she was bringing us for
mental health checks

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
when we first saw it to
psychiatrists to make sure

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:84%
that we weren't all just in some
sort of weird delusional house.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And then my father,
of course, he

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
was getting help
for what he had.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
But my parents ended
up getting divorced.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And then when this
all sort of happened,

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:84%
the activity continued
with shadow figures,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and what appeared to just be
things that weren't, I guess,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:84%
maybe positive or
there to support us.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And so my mom, the
first thing she did

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:90%
was call a local priest.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Help, help.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yes, yes, she kind
of kept it low because she was

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:84%
a school teacher, and my dad
had been a police officer,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
so being public servants, They
didn't want to advertise a huge

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:90%
haunting--

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: --and have
that reflect on us.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:90%
So she calls the priest.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The priest comes does
the blessing, But.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.230 align:middle line:90%
He witnessed some activity.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So he kindly told my mother that
this was beyond his abilities

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.612 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He wasn't an exorcist.

00:04:44.612 --> 00:04:45.445 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Exactly.

00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was just a priest.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Right, right,
he's the local parish priest.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.577 align:middle line:84%
So he's thinking, you
know, I've done my part.

00:04:51.577 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He gives
communion, you know.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Confession.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: This is it, right?

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:90%
I sprinkled some holy water.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be on my way.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So she didn't know what to
do because that didn't really

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:90%
change anything.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:84%
We were still having
activity off and on.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And then she called
a pastor that was

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.980 align:middle line:90%
recommended to her by friends.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And he did go into
the house, and he

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
went into what was
my childhood bedroom.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And I guess he was
interested in this room

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:84%
because my rosary beads
had broken in that room

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:90%
and things of that nature.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: So he says
in there that he finds

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
the cause of the haunting.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:84%
But what he more or less comes
back and says is, to my mother,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:84%
your daughter has Grateful
Dead posters on her wall, so,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:90%
they probably--

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blame the posters.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah the
Grateful Dead posters

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:90%
brought in demons he tells her.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say, despite my mom
being better safe than sorry

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.347 align:middle line:84%
and removing my
posters, this was not

00:05:46.347 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:90%
the cause of our haunting.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's Jerry
Garcia's fault.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: It was not.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
When has a hippie
folk band ever haunted

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
somebody as house demonically,
right, so or whatever,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.240 align:middle line:90%
negatively.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.083 align:middle line:90%
So that didn't help.

00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And then that's
when she found out

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:90%
about Ed and Lorraine Warren.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:84%
The number was given
to her by someone,

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:90%
and she gave them a call.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
came to that point.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
come to the house?

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah, so Ed was
pretty sick at that time.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So Lorraine came as sort
of like the front person.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Funny enough,
before she came, she

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.220 align:middle line:84%
told my mom to tell the
house that she was coming,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and the activity
got really quiet.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So my mom thought she had done
some miraculous prayer that

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:90%
had worked.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.500 align:middle line:84%
But she said, no, if
it got quiet, honey,

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
that means that they
know I'm coming,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:90%
and they don't want me to.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And so she came with her team,
and she interviewed the family.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:90%
And she investigated the home.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:90%
She talked to me too.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
She felt like I had some
anger at what was going on

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:middle line:84%
in the house and with
my dad and talked

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
to me about the importance
of energy and emotions.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But she did think
our home had become

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:90%
a train station for spirits.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:90%
And there were good ones.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:90%
There were bad ones.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
There were bad ones that had
responded to a darkness that

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:90%
had happened.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: And she was going
to get rid of that dark energy

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:90%
with a cleansing of the home.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Courtney,
what do you think

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the impetus was for the
spirits to hit the home?

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.315 align:middle line:84%
Not the Grateful
Dead, of course.

00:07:16.315 --> 00:07:17.732 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Not
the Grateful Dead.

00:07:17.732 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what did
you think was going on?

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I think
that there was

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot of emotion in my
family about worrying

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:90%
about my dad's mental health.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I think his job at
that time, and things

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:84%
he was taking from his
job, at that time, all sort

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
of collided into a place
that was already a little bit

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.215 align:middle line:84%
energetically prepared
to be haunted.

00:07:39.215 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Because we had
that minute stuff.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think
they followed your father,

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:90%
basically, to the house.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I think so, and
I think, my poor father,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.070 align:middle line:90%
he also suffered addiction.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
saw this darkness,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.837 align:middle line:84%
and it almost
perpetuated that darkness

00:07:54.837 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:90%
and made it worse for him.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
addiction did he have?

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: To medications that
he was given for mental health.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah,
yeah, and I think

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
that an energy sort of saw an
opportunity there to come in.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the family
still own the house?

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: No, my
mother did sell it.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
When I went to college,
and I was studying abroad,

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:90%
she sold the house.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.700 align:middle line:84%
The activity had
started to resume.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
My father passed
away shortly after.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't living in the
house when it got really bad.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:90%
OK,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.297 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sorry to hear that.

00:08:30.297 --> 00:08:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Thank you.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But Lorraine did
tell my mom that when

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the house was sold, that
it could reopen things

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
because she had more
or less sort of created

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
a bubble around our
family and our life there.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
But the house could
have retained energy.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, did you have
to disclose to the new buyers--

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: No.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that this was a--
in some states, you have to.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: In
Connecticut, you don't.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
I just met the newest owner

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.270 align:middle line:90%
of the house last week.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And she told me that she's
having a very happy time there

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:04.920 align:middle line:90%
and no hauntings.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:90%
So I'm happy to hear that.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they followed
the family, primarily,

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:90%
I would think.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I don't think
we were followed, honestly.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I think Lorraine
cleansed the negative

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and made sure the
negative didn't stay.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that our
family just sort of--

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:84%
my sisters, they
don't have anything

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:90%
to do with the paranormal.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:84%
They're totally happy, and
my mom doesn't really either.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It's more me who was
intrigued and wanted answers,

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and I look for spirit connection
in a more positive way

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:90%
and a less fearful way.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then at
what point, Courtney,

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.460 align:middle line:84%
did you put together the
Haunted History Tours?

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I did that
in 2013, after I had just

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:90%
left the government jobs.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I graduated after interning at
NCIS, which is Naval Criminal

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Investigative Service.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought maybe it
was the TV show you were on.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: (LAUGHING) No, no,
the real one in the Washington

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Navy Yard.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I had gone to school
in Washington DC.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And I loved putting
together the pieces

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
and finding information
that no one else had ever

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:90%
found about cases.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And so when I did
that, I thought,

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
this is what I want
to do for a job.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:90%
This is really fascinating.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:90%
And NCIS said, we're not hiring.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So the FBI was having
a hiring blitz,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and they saw my experience.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I
started with the FBI.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, for me,
because I was more focused

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:84%
on the work I had
done at NCIS, I

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
got placed in
counterterrorism after I

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:90%
finished the FBI Academy.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yes,
and I didn't feel

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:84%
like I was particularly
knowledgeable

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:84%
about counterterrorism, but that
was where they needed people.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
doing that, I just

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel a
connection with my work.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And I more or less didn't like
going to an office from 9 to 5.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who does.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Right, it just
that was draining my soul.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So I thought maybe
I'll change my scenery.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
working for Homeland Security

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
because they had an
opportunity in Vermont,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and Vermont is lovely,
and my sister lived there.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:90%
And I could be closer to family.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I did that for a
while, but again, it was still

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:90%
that 9 to 5 office job.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I just had better surroundings.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:84%
However, when I was there
at Homeland Security,

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.370 align:middle line:90%
I met a woman.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I went on a ghost tour, and
she was running the ghost tour.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Thea Lewis.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And she was spreading
history, mysterious stories,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:90%
talking about these things.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:90%
She had books about it.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I was little,
I always thought

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be an author.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
My parents read to me every
night when I was growing up,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to write.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did it.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:90%
You did it.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yes,
and she inspired me.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I thought, she's interested
in history and mystery.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.770 align:middle line:84%
My father read me history
books when I would go to bed.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, this is the dream.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said, will you
have lunch with me

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:90%
and tell me how you got started?

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you can
do this too Courtney.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said I'd love
to do this at home.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back
home to Connecticut,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and I started Seaside
Shadows Haunted History Tours

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and started writing my
books and left the jobs

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.150 align:middle line:90%
with the man behind.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.608 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you still started
investigating ghosts at this

00:12:27.608 --> 00:12:28.408 align:middle line:90%
point--

00:12:28.408 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I did.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.443 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --which is interesting.

00:12:31.443 --> 00:12:33.670 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip of you
using your special tools

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.685 align:middle line:90%
to talk to ghosts.

00:12:34.685 --> 00:12:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes, yes.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's watch this.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.125 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: OK, sure.

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:37.925 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
- We're definitely getting
closer to more and more of what

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:84%
appears to be old settlements,
some of the old trees,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely getting
a little bit spookier,

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:84%
so we thought this would be
a great place to investigate.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.230 align:middle line:84%
What we'll be using today
is our EMF detector,

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:84%
which I believe all of
you are familiar with,

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and we'll keep an eye on
it for flickering lights.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And then also, in lieu of a
spirit box because there's

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.510 align:middle line:84%
no signal here to help
generate the white noise,

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be using
the Echo Vox, which

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:84%
is an app recommended to me by
John Zaffis that reverberates

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
echoes that it hears of
voices and as interpreted

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.050 align:middle line:90%
through the app of those voices.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be using this
to communicate with the spirits

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.460 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:90%
- Yes, did you hear that?

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:90%
A male said yes.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:90%
- Al--

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.630 align:middle line:90%
- That sounded like Alan.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Alan, is there an Alan here?

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.280 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.280 align:middle line:84%
- Yes, do you hear that
male voice responding?

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.945 align:middle line:90%
Alan, what is your family name?

I heard an "Ed."

- Nine.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:90%
- Nine, nine.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.965 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: Clearly
there's something there.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some little voice.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, where were you?

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: This was an
area known as Dudleytown

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:84%
in Northwest Connecticut, which
is a ghost town, they call it.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an old abandoned town.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:90%
The ground wasn't fertile.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
People didn't really
have a great opportunity

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
there after the Revolutionary
War when they were building.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.400 align:middle line:84%
However, a lot of
the people that did

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.950 align:middle line:84%
live there reported that
that was not really why

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:90%
the town became a ghost town.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:90%
People were going mad up there.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:90%
They were murdering each other.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: They would come
home and find each other

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.770 align:middle line:84%
in maniacal laughter, so
no one lives in that area.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:84%
There's some homes, and they
call themselves the Dark Forest

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Association, and they employ
police to keep people out

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:84%
of the forest when they're
not supposed to be.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But there is a nature trail
now that goes through it,

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and you can go see the old
foundations of Dudleytown.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.822 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who would want to?

00:16:08.822 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Me, [LAUGHS]
I just want to know why

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and what happened
and if it's true.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, this app that
you had, how was it developed?

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: So it's developed in
the same thing as a spirit box

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.370 align:middle line:90%
sort of.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Like I was saying, a spirit box
sweeps through radio stations

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.830 align:middle line:84%
rapidly to generate
white noise to allow

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:90%
spirits to communicate.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:84%
This sweeps through frequencies
to generate something

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.230 align:middle line:84%
that spirits can manipulate so
that their voices reverberate

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:90%
back in an echo.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly there
was some kind of voice

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate with you.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:44.905 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:44.905 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could hear it.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah, and I love
when they communicate with me.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:84%
I call that sort of
an active haunting,

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.270 align:middle line:84%
meaning that they
see me, and they

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
know that I'm talking to
them, and they hear me.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're answering
me intelligently,

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and that means that they
probably know they're dead,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.172 align:middle line:84%
or they're trying to convey
some sort of message.

00:17:04.172 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Courtney, what
allowed you to start flowing

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:90%
into investigate battlefields?

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: That had a
lot to do with my work

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.829 align:middle line:84%
at Seaside Shadows,
but I also have

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.240 align:middle line:90%
to credit my father with that.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.089 align:middle line:90%
He raised me on Civil War books.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And after I had written about
Connecticut and the places I

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
was investigating
there, I thought

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.910 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
investigate the Civil War.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to that,
it was during COVID

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
that I had this
really strange dream.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
The Civil War wasn't
sort of on my brain.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.102 align:middle line:90%
That's in the background.

00:17:37.102 --> 00:17:37.902 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:17:37.902 --> 00:17:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: And during COVID,
I was making video segments

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
like this where I was
investigating haunted places

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
or going to cemeteries
and sharing stories.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was scheduled
with my husband who

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:84%
was filming me to make a
recording about a woman

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
during the Revolutionary War.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.110 align:middle line:84%
The next day we were going
to go film at her grave.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I had this
dream and these two boys

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:84%
appeared to me in this dream
in Union Civil War uniform.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.800 align:middle line:90%
And they were young.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, they conveyed
to me that they lived nearby.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:90%
And that I had to find them.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:90%
That their stone was nearby.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell that
they were Civil War,

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and they said they
were brothers.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So I woke up not
remembering much else

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
from the dream other than
that, and told my husband

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.290 align:middle line:84%
we have to find these two
brothers that lived near here

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.940 align:middle line:90%
who died during the Civil War.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, you're
filming Abigail today.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:90%
We're not doing that.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.693 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: But I
went and found them.

00:18:33.693 --> 00:18:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
think they contacted you?

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I think
that they were

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:84%
ready for their
story to be shared

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.020 align:middle line:90%
and for them to be remembered.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think they were
leading me into sharing

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:84%
the stories of so many like
them whose stories have

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:90%
been forgotten.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
find their monuments,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:84%
find out what happened to them,
find their graves from where

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.530 align:middle line:84%
they were imprisoned
and where they died

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:90%
and share their story.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to find the
stories of so many others.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spirit boxes.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.253 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've used them.

00:19:07.253 --> 00:19:08.053 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:19:08.053 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You like them?

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I do.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to be
cautious in that you're not

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:84%
hearing the radio and
mistaking that for a spirit.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.255 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to make
sure you get really responses

00:19:20.255 --> 00:19:21.380 align:middle line:90%
that are responding to you.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:84%
But I do think it's a
great opportunity for us,

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.660 align:middle line:84%
in real time, to hear
a voice from the past.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because if it's not a
voice from a past, what is it,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.670 align:middle line:90%
interference?

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: It could
be interference.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.940 align:middle line:90%
It could be a radio wave.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why I tell people,
listen for multiple sweeps

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.630 align:middle line:84%
because it's sweeping
through the radio.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So you want to hear a voice

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:48.930 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

If I heard your voice, I don't
want to call you a ghost,

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we have a clip
of you Courtney actually hearing

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:90%
a ghost--

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --on a battlefield.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

[PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did we
just see and hear?

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: So that is at
the Antietam Battlefield,

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and that was considered
the bloodiest day

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.840 align:middle line:90%
in America, September 17, 1862.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tragic, lost
thousands, didn't we?

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: 20,000 casualties.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: It was terrible,
and that was General Mansfield.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.757 align:middle line:84%
Now, General Mansfield,
he was from Connecticut.

00:20:54.757 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think that was the
General coming through to you?

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:10%
>>MCINVALE: I do because I was
standing where he was mortally

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:10%
wounded, at that exact spot.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.910 align:middle line:10%
And I was asking him, as I
was standing at that spot

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:10%
where he was shot from,
and he answered that.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was already
intuitively looking

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
in that direction
thinking, yeah,

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that's where they
might have hidden,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.080 align:middle line:90%
and no one would have noticed.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.480 align:middle line:84%
But what made me know
that it was really

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:84%
him wouldn't come
until weeks later.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I was researching his story
at the Historical Society

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that actually sits in
his home in Connecticut.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And they had the letters that
were sent home to his wife.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And all of the soldiers
that remarked to his wife,

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
as was tradition at the time,
to say what happened to him,

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
said that he was
yelling when he was shot

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.853 align:middle line:90%
that he was shot from his left.

00:21:43.853 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
published in the papers.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
what he was saying.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: His last words
were, "from your left."

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think he wanted with you?

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I think he
was just answering me

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.650 align:middle line:84%
about his story to make sure
I understood what happened.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I found out that, for him,
on that day at the battle,

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:84%
other generals weren't
listening to him.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
He had an instinct
and intuition,

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and he was trying
to protect everyone.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was disregarded because
it was early in the war.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's trying to
say, I knew they were there,

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.170 align:middle line:90%
and I'm still here too.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.562 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ulysses S Grant--

00:22:16.562 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I love him.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --had an
interesting wife.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: He did, Julia.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she had a lot of
premonitions about his death,

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:90%
did she not?

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: She had a
premonition about him

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.600 align:middle line:90%
and Lincoln, to be honest.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:84%
This was one of my favorite
stories that I ever heard.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Lincoln had a
dream about his own death.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: He sure did.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'll get into that.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: He sure did.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So Julia didn't get along
with Mary Todd Lincoln.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:90%
They weren't best friends.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:48.362 align:middle line:84%
But Grant, who was, of course,
the Union General and Commander

00:22:48.362 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
for the Union during
the Civil War,

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.740 align:middle line:84%
was good friends
with Lincoln, right?

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So Grant and Lincoln
would have some events

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:84%
together after the end of the
war, like, public appearances.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.450 align:middle line:84%
They were due to
go to the theater

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:84%
together on the night
Lincoln was shot.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: However,
prior to that,

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Julia had a dream that Lincoln
and her husband Ulysses

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:90%
would be shot.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And she said to him, you're
not going to the theater.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
To which he said, I
know, basically, you're

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.848 align:middle line:84%
trying to avoid hanging
out with Mary Todd.

00:23:19.848 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you tell
the president no, right?

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Right, like
we have to do this.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.105 align:middle line:84%
And she said tell him we have
to go home to our children.

00:23:26.105 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:90%
We have to be safe.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And then a messenger came
to deliver the invitation

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.630 align:middle line:84%
to the theater to their place
where they were staying.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And she said that messenger
is one of the party that's

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:90%
going to kill Lincoln.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:90%
She knew it.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
Ulysses believes her.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.600 align:middle line:90%
He loves his wife very much.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And they left and told
Lincoln that they wouldn't

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:90%
be able to go to the theater.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And Lincoln was shot
and killed that night.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.313 align:middle line:84%
And it was turned out
that Ulysses was supposed

00:23:51.313 --> 00:23:52.480 align:middle line:90%
to be killed that night too.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, both of them,
yeah, a double assassination.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Lincoln's dream was
he walked into the State Room

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:90%
at the White House.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there was a
person in a casket surrounded

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:90%
by soldiers.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: And he asked
who died, and they said,

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:90%
the president.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he looked
in, and it was him.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes, yeah.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's got
to be kind of jarring.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah, and it
happened a week before,

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:90%
and it happened more than once.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And Lincoln believed
in spiritualism too.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Him and Mary Todd had
seances in the White House

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with their son.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:84%
They very much were a believer
in omens from the spirit world.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.062 align:middle line:90%
So he was unnerved.

00:24:27.062 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about the drumming

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:90%
you heard at Gettysburg.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: So Gettysburg is
this remarkable residual haunt.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like we step back
in time, or perhaps we do.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps we do.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can hear
what's happening there

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:90%
as if we're at the battle.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I was at
Gettysburg, not long ago,

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I walked onto the
wheat field, which

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:84%
was a clash between
Georgia and Connecticut,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:84%
which is honestly the
people I'm writing about,

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:90%
and I heard drumming.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.770 align:middle line:84%
It was so real, I thought that
it was re-enactors at first,

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:84%
until I walked out
there and saw no one.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:84%
My husband drove
around to see if there

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:84%
were any re-enactors
whose drums could

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.480 align:middle line:90%
have been echoing through.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like drumming of
a garrison or something

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.400 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Drumming
like marching into battle

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:90%
or even a death march

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.313 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Boom baba
boom ba ba bom bom.

00:25:14.313 --> 00:25:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: And we heard a
couple different cadences.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it stopped, and
then it came back again.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was in a thunderstorm,
like, this electric energy,

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and then you could
hear the drumming.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
they say a picture

00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:90%
is worth a thousand words.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
this experience you have.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:43.155 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.155 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could hear
drumming in the background.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.080 align:middle line:10%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.970 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's pretty incredible.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:90%
I get chills still.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
pick this up on video?

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: [LAUGHS] I--

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:57.798 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you a magnet?

00:25:57.798 --> 00:25:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I would
like to think so.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I spend a lot of
time on battlefields

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:84%
trying to talk to spirits
and connect with them

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and be open to them and hope
that they're receptive to me.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.870 align:middle line:84%
But I also just think that
there's some places where

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:90%
we have this luck.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you, my husband
and a friend were with me,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and their phones didn't
record the sound.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you got it.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: But it came on mine.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was further
away from the sound.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.872 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think all
battlefields, Courtney,

00:26:23.872 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:90%
have ghosts?

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I think
all battlefields

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:84%
have energetic
heartbeats of history.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's a
ghost who very much maybe

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:90%
didn't know they passed.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, it's the
impact of all of these people

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:84%
who clashed with each
other in utter violence

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.760 align:middle line:90%
and hand-to-hand combat.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.307 align:middle line:84%
These young people who didn't
know they were going to die.

00:26:46.307 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So much distress.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: And that
energy, just sits there.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.162 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Negative, negative.

00:26:50.162 --> 00:26:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: And it
can never go anywhere.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:52.910 align:middle line:90%
It will always be there.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what's
there and a reminder.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
certain time to see ghosts?

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: You know, I have
luck at all different times.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:84%
With the drumming, I found
out that was actually

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:05.870 align:middle line:84%
during the hours that the
clash in the wheat field

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:90%
was occurring.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes maybe you
can have more occurrences

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:90%
on an anniversary.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But really, if you're receptive,
I think it can be any time.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Antietam, of
course, had a battlefield

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.060 align:middle line:90%
which was called Bloody Lane.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: So Antietam
was a single-day battle,

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.460 align:middle line:84%
unlike Gettysburg
which was three days.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But we kind of separate
when we look at battlefields

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:84%
by areas where different
engagements happen

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:90%
during a battle.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:84%
The Bloody Lane was just
known as the Sunken Road.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.930 align:middle line:84%
It was an old farm
road in rural Maryland.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bloody Lane
or the Sunken Road,

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.573 align:middle line:84%
there were Confederates that
were sort of staged, you know,

00:27:45.573 --> 00:27:47.490 align:middle line:84%
like it was their trenches
with their weapons.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Union was going
to infiltrate into there,

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and try to shoot those
Confederates, which they do.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Boy, you
know your history.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah, and
the Union shoots them,

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.030 align:middle line:90%
and they die in there.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.370 align:middle line:84%
But they shoot the Union,
and the Union falls in there.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So all their bodies
just get lined up here

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:90%
piled on top of each other.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And the blood runs
through it, and this place

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:84%
was never the same and always
sort of remained haunted.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And it became known
as the Bloody Lane.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we have a
clip of you at Bloody Lane.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.655 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:28:16.655 --> 00:28:16.930 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:10%
- Now, as for
paranormal activity,

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.200 align:middle line:10%
there's quite a bit
of it reported here.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.780 align:middle line:10%
People report seeing
figures walking the lane,

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:10%
seeing them laying down,
hearing crying, hearing moaning,

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.480 align:middle line:10%
hearing attacks come
from the battlefield.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.360 align:middle line:84%
We just heard a park ranger talk
about a figure in white that

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:84%
appeared that he
thought might have been

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.720 align:middle line:90%
a Medal of Honor recipient.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But more commonly than
not, school field trips

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.620 align:middle line:90%
report a lot of activity here.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:10%
And there was an Irish Brigade
led by a man from Ireland

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.060 align:middle line:10%
on the Union side.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.600 align:middle line:10%
And he had a battle cry that
was [NON-ENGLISH] which sounds

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:10%
a lot like, fa, la, la, la,
la or something like that from

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:10%
a Christmas time.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So they ran up to their
teacher telling them

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that they heard someone singing
Christmas carols in the field.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:10%
The teacher looked around
and of course, saw no one,

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:10%
but then saw that
Irish battle cry.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.540 align:middle line:10%
This is the Bloody Lane.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.340 align:middle line:90%
[PLAYBACK ENDS]

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You heard that
cry in the background,

00:29:06.417 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah, and I didn't
hear it when I was there.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you sure
it's not some guy hiding

00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:12.558 align:middle line:90%
behind a tree going, wah.

00:29:12.558 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:90%
That day, it was 105 degrees.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And the only other people
we had seen were family,

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and we waited until they
were completely gone

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.870 align:middle line:84%
because I don't like
anyone in the background

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:90%
when I'm doing my stuff.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I was sure that
I was completely alone

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:90%
there that day.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't hear
the crying until later

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:84%
when we were reviewing
my little history tidbit.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to be a
lot of pain at these sites.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You feel that
when you're there?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I do.

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.220 align:middle line:84%
You feel-- you feel pain,
and you feel sadness,

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.110 align:middle line:90%
and you feel fear.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
scared too, then?

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I'm not scared of
them, but I feel their fear.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Their fear of not
knowing what to expect

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing that this
would be the end for them.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are they
reaching out to you?

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I've
spent a lot of time

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.980 align:middle line:90%
trying to reach out to them.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I try to be understanding
to them and their story.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them I want
their stories to be shared.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
know that I will

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:84%
do my best to share the
tales of who they are

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and what they meant and
what happened to them.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And so that way, their soul
might have a little peace.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think
after almost 200 years,

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.860 align:middle line:84%
they had had enough of
this, but they don't.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Time doesn't
work that way, I don't think,

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.910 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:37.280 align:middle line:84%
For them, it could have been
as soon as yesterday in the way

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:90%
that time works.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And for us, it's
hundreds of years,

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:90%
but they don't feel that.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These spirits,
as they reach out to you--

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --do they talk
to you, or do they just

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.580 align:middle line:84%
do it in song and
symbols and you know?

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.380 align:middle line:90%
- It depends.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So you heard General
Mansfield spoke,

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes when I'm
there, if I'm really focused,

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I can almost hear the voices
of them or answering me.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times,
it's them leading me

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.130 align:middle line:84%
to information or something
of that nature that

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:90%
allows me to find more.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:84%
But I try to record conversation
with them as much as I can.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they visit
you at home, or always

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.570 align:middle line:90%
on scenes and sites?

00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: You know,
I think they do.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.970 align:middle line:90%
I live in an old house.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I decorate it with
pictures of all of the people

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:90%
that I write about too.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So I probably honor
them in that way.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And we do have doors open
and shut and footsteps.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:90%
But I live in a very old home.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And my husband always
says to me, Courtney,

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.890 align:middle line:90%
you're taking them home again.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:38.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, it's fine.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.928 align:middle line:84%
They're just passing
through saying hello.

00:31:40.928 --> 00:31:43.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, what does
hubby think about all this?

00:31:43.095 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: [LAUGHS]
He's really good.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.460 align:middle line:84%
He's the man behind the
camera, God bless him.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So he's really good, and
he gets really excited.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.090 align:middle line:84%
He found that cry and
immediately called me

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:54.890 align:middle line:84%
when he was reviewing
the footage.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:84%
He loves history,
and he and I both

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:84%
had ancestors in all of
these wars and things

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.080 align:middle line:90%
that I write about.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of like the idea
that we're touching base

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:90%
with our own past.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you hear these
sounds, Courtney, when

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:09.853 align:middle line:90%
you're there live in the field?

00:32:09.853 --> 00:32:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: So the
drumming I did.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:12.020 align:middle line:90%
The drumming I did.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You hear it
in the background.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I heard
it in the background.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I've heard cannons
in the background,

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.510 align:middle line:90%
gunfire in the background.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I've heard people talking
in the background.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:84%
The cry just took
me by surprise.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.320 align:middle line:90%
I didn't hear that that day.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
ever hear shouts?

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Go get him,
things like that?

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.997 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah, they would
often say that to each other.

00:32:30.997 --> 00:32:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Go get 'em boys and
things like that.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.010 align:middle line:90%
And you can hear those shouts.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:84%
You can hear what sounds like
a battle cry or a rebel yell.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we'll hear a
lot of that sound coming

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.670 align:middle line:84%
from the woods, which was
iconic for the Confederates.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.402 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
spirits expect from you?

00:32:46.402 --> 00:32:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I don't know that
they expect anything from me,

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:84%
but I think they hope that
I will share their legacy.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're contacting
you for a reason.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I know.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There must
be something going on.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I don't want
to put anything on them.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that their hope is
that their legacy doesn't die

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.990 align:middle line:90%
and that I can help them.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And have you?

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I've been
writing many books.

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So I've written two books
about the Civil War soldiers

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and one about the
Revolutionary War.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still going.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still going there all
the time to talk about them

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that people know
their stories and who they are.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of people go
on these haunted history tours?

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Oh, everybody.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I like to think that there's
something for everyone

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.685 align:middle line:84%
on these tours and
in these books,

00:33:30.685 --> 00:33:32.810 align:middle line:84%
whether it's people who
are interested in their own

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.925 align:middle line:84%
history, they're interested
in ghost stories,

00:33:34.925 --> 00:33:36.800 align:middle line:84%
they're interested in
understanding something

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.030 align:middle line:90%
that happened to them.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.800 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully, it's
someone who wants

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.250 align:middle line:84%
to know where we came from and
how it still resonates today.

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever get reports
of lights in the area, UFO type

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:90%
things or anything like that?

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I do.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:50.920 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So I will fully admit to you
I am very focused on my ghosts

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.980 align:middle line:90%
from the past.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.800 align:middle line:84%
However, it seems
that a lot of times

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:84%
where one paranormal thing
resides, other things

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:90%
reside too.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.050 align:middle line:84%
During COVID, I
started researching

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:14.150 align:middle line:84%
an area that had this infamous
axe murder by a madman.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:84%
And then I noticed
there were other legends

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:22.260 align:middle line:84%
of Native American creatures,
of UFOs, things like that.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.460 align:middle line:90%
And that was intriguing.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And then it sort of came right
into my own backyard in Mystic.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I was training a tour guide,
and he was facing the audience.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:33.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was in the audience.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And above his head,
way up in the sky,

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.120 align:middle line:90%
I saw these three red lights.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.310 align:middle line:90%
And they were enormous.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he see
them too or just you?

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I was the only one
facing it because they were all

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.230 align:middle line:90%
looking at him.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.050 align:middle line:90%
And I looked up.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, he'd have
to look up and back.

00:34:47.925 --> 00:34:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: And I saw
them, and they went away.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.517 align:middle line:84%
And I whispered to my husband
because I had him over.

00:34:53.517 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:90%
I said, did you see?

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.142 align:middle line:84%
He said, no, I was
paying attention to him.

00:34:56.142 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said, shoot, there
were these lights up there.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
But I do enough ghosts, I
don't have room for UFOs too.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
know, let's look up

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.770 align:middle line:90%
and see if anyone else saw it.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And we saw that someone
else did reported it

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.360 align:middle line:90%
online at the same time.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.200 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't sure what it was.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple of weeks
later, one of my tour guides

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:21.050 align:middle line:84%
got a photo taken on his
tour from a guest of what

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:26.300 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be this UFO type
anomaly in the sky just sitting

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.410 align:middle line:90%
over the Mystic River.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly,
something was there.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Something was there.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Clearly.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.542 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever it was.

00:35:31.542 --> 00:35:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Whatever
it was, yeah.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who is, what
is your favorite ghost?

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: My favorite
ghost, it's so hard to pick.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.662 align:middle line:84%
I love-- I love
them all so much.

00:35:43.662 --> 00:35:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've become
friends with them.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I know,
and I feel bad if I,

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.177 align:middle line:90%
like, favor any of them.

00:35:49.177 --> 00:35:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're listening
to you right now.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:51.580 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:51.736 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I know.

00:35:51.736 --> 00:35:52.300 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.540 align:middle line:84%
They're listening thinking,
who is she going to say?

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it me?

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Is it me?

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: [LAUGHS]
I have so many

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:90%
for so many different reasons.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.760 align:middle line:84%
The Brooks brothers always
have a place in my heart

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.440 align:middle line:90%
for leading me forward.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.100 align:middle line:84%
There were some
brothers from Georgia,

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:84%
which is where my
dad was from, that

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.950 align:middle line:84%
led me to write about
Georgia, the Jeffers brothers.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So those are some
of my favorites.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.460 align:middle line:84%
But I also have a
lot of encounters

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:84%
with the spirits of
generals like Mansfield,

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:84%
like Nathaniel Lyon, and on
the Confederate side, Stonewall

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Jackson, Robert E. Lee,
a whole bunch of them.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I've just had
interesting encounters.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
recommend to people, Courtney,

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.010 align:middle line:84%
who encounter a
ghost, they don't have

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:38.630 align:middle line:90%
any experience handling ghosts.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.770 align:middle line:84%
They may not even
know what they are,

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.628 align:middle line:84%
but what do you
recommend they do?

00:36:42.628 --> 00:36:44.045 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: If
they encounter one.

00:36:44.045 --> 00:36:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If they encounter one.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I
recommend that they

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.520 align:middle line:84%
treat them with
respect and kindness

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and try not to
respond with fear.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.130 align:middle line:84%
When we respond with
fear, we get fear back

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.110 align:middle line:90%
or the energy sort of becomes--

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:36:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Funky in a way.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:05.030 align:middle line:84%
If you respond just like they
would have responded to you

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.973 align:middle line:90%
if they saw each other alive.

00:37:06.973 --> 00:37:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So I tell people,
you're not going

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:84%
to walk into a
living person's house

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and start acting weird around
them and demanding things.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:17.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you encounter a spirit,
ask them who they are,

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.520 align:middle line:84%
what their name
is, what they need,

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.370 align:middle line:90%
and try to have a conversation.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.270 align:middle line:90%
And try to keep it peaceful.

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And then let them know
that they can move along,

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:84%
or they can stick around
if it's up to you.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you miss
work with the FBI?

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: No.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not at all.

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Not at all.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you
replaced it with this.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Not at all.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.640 align:middle line:90%
I actually never looked back.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the path I
was always meant to be on.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just grateful at all the
experiences that led me here.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do people find you?

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: So people can find
me through Seaside Shadows.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:57.500 align:middle line:84%
People can find me on my author
website courtneymcinvale.com.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And they can correspond
with me, check out my books,

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and see what events
I have going on.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
next for you, Courtney?

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: What's
next is I'm going

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.860 align:middle line:84%
to keep cultivating events
where we can share haunted

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.810 align:middle line:84%
stories with
people, but I'm also

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.570 align:middle line:84%
going to keep writing those
books and sharing those stories

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and ensuring that the heartbeats
of history are remembered.

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I look at you,
and I see someone who

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.200 align:middle line:90%
loves doing what you're doing.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I do.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
a game with you.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: No.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you take
it darn seriously.

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I do.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:32.650 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.453 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
emotionally gotten upset--

00:38:35.453 --> 00:38:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Oh my gosh, yes.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --on a tour
or something like that?

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE:
Generally, on a tour,

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:41.970 align:middle line:90%
I can usually keep it together.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm writing stories
or I'm investigating on my own,

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.730 align:middle line:90%
sometimes I've definitely cried.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:48.800 align:middle line:90%
I've felt sadness.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I read a story, I'll tell
you, and I wrote about it,

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.950 align:middle line:84%
about a dog that
followed these soldiers

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:58.010 align:middle line:84%
around throughout the whole war
as this sort of spirit guide.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.720 align:middle line:84%
He appeared when
they needed him.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:84%
He stayed till the very end,
until shrapnel just hit him out

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.550 align:middle line:90%
of nowhere.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And I cried reading that
whole story and the three page

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:11.600 align:middle line:84%
obituary these soldiers wrote
about the soul of this dog.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Just they are people like us.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.620 align:middle line:90%
They have these stories like us.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And it definitely makes me feel
for them and gets me emotional.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what would you
tell people who don't believe?

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.940 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to them?

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I say, that's fine,
just stay open and remember

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.010 align:middle line:90%
that your ancestors--

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And stay away.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: [LAUGHS]
Stay open and I

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.190 align:middle line:84%
remind them your ancestors
believed in a soul that

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.720 align:middle line:90%
lived separately from the body.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.300 align:middle line:84%
What you call it, what you
name it doesn't matter,

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.730 align:middle line:84%
but there's an essence
and an energy to us,

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.230 align:middle line:90%
and it never goes away.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have
relatives at Gettysburg?

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I did.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:51.760 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
happened to them?

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Some of my
three-times great grandfathers

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.520 align:middle line:90%
were there.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.982 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they pass--

00:39:57.982 --> 00:39:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I did have.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --there.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: The ones that
fought at Gettysburg, actually

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:03.890 align:middle line:84%
survived Gettysburg,
but I did have

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:07.250 align:middle line:84%
a three-times great grandfather
who died in Manassas.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.030 align:middle line:90%
And he was only 21 years old.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what
recommendation would

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.400 align:middle line:84%
you give to people
who have children,

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and they want them to learn
things about American history?

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: I would
tell them, you

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.700 align:middle line:84%
know what, bring
them right to it

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.160 align:middle line:84%
because maybe they can
learn it from the source.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, we can
utilize this fascination

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.400 align:middle line:84%
with the supernatural
or the unknown

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.790 align:middle line:84%
to help educate people
about what really happened

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and to help history live
on in a way that's not just

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.948 align:middle line:84%
numbers in a book but a
face and a name and a story.

00:40:42.948 --> 00:40:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think you'd
scare the living daylights out

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:46.630 align:middle line:90%
of the little ones?

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: No, I think
tell them the story.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And then once they have a name
and they know that's a person,

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:52.870 align:middle line:90%
they won't be too scared.

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.540 align:middle line:84%
They'll be happy that someone
from the past was there.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The pain, though,
that must be at Gettysburg

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:00.490 align:middle line:90%
is unbelievable.

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I have heard
from other sources too--

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Mm-hmm

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --of people
who have witnessed

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:90%
seeing the ghosts of soldiers.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.125 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
screams of soldiers.

00:41:11.125 --> 00:41:11.925 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah.

00:41:11.925 --> 00:41:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The pain, the agony.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a horrible
time in this country.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.127 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: It was horrible.

00:41:17.127 --> 00:41:20.900 align:middle line:84%
It was the deadliest
battle of the Civil War.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.560 align:middle line:84%
The Civil War had 640,000
casualties in four years,

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and Gettysburg had
near 50,000 casualties

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.932 align:middle line:84%
over these three
days, casualties,

00:41:29.932 --> 00:41:31.640 align:middle line:84%
including wounded and
missing, of course.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure,

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: But
to me, Gettysburg

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:84%
is a perfect example
of a residual haunt.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.660 align:middle line:90%
So I tell people to take heart.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that the
spirits are there in agony.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.040 align:middle line:84%
It means that what
happened to them is still

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.780 align:middle line:84%
replaying in the earth
there where we are in a way.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.597 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that they
are there actively in pain.

00:41:56.597 --> 00:41:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Courtney, if
you had an opportunity

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:01.670 align:middle line:84%
to talk to one ghost
from Gettysburg,

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.920 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell him?

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Huh, oh my
gosh, it would probably

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:13.320 align:middle line:90%
be General Iverson from Georgia.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, don't you dare
send those boys into those pits

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.150 align:middle line:84%
because all of them
are going to die.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And it will be the
deadliest charge,

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and your life will
change forever.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he may
say it's too late.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: He may.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I think I accidentally
encountered General Iverson.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I saw a fearful spirit
right where the charge was.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:34.990 align:middle line:84%
It was the oldest recorded
story at Gettysburg.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:37.900 align:middle line:84%
He was a little out
of sorts, not himself.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Some say he was drunk because
his wife had just died,

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.720 align:middle line:84%
but he sent 900 men
in into a firing pit,

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.950 align:middle line:90%
and they all died in minutes.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And they still rise
up out of those pits.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I was there, I saw the
face of a man in the darkness,

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.568 align:middle line:84%
when my husband was away from
me, looking at me afraid that I

00:42:54.568 --> 00:42:56.860 align:middle line:84%
didn't realize till I was
looking at pictures of people

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.310 align:middle line:90%
later, looked like him.

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we got in the car
and we were driving away,

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I could still see him
on the side of the car.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And the indicator
light was going off

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.400 align:middle line:84%
that something was
next to the car.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think General Iverson
would be the one I'd talk to.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were in a
TV show like "Quantum Leap,"

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and you appeared in the 1800s
at Gettysburg in the middle

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:22.090 align:middle line:84%
of this horrible,
horrible battle--

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yeah.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --what
would you be doing?

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCINVALE: Oh, I would
be trying to help.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd be tending to the wounded
trying to pull them back

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:30.930 align:middle line:90%
from the fray.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:33.962 align:middle line:84%
I would like to say I would be
negotiating with the generals.

00:43:33.962 --> 00:43:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell General Iverson,
I want to tell General Lee,

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:39.120 align:middle line:84%
don't send those
boys on that charge.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I also don't want to do that
because then maybe the Union

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:42.720 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't win.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.120 align:middle line:90%
So I would be helping.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.227 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
there's anything else

00:43:47.227 --> 00:43:49.560 align:middle line:84%
that a woman at that time
would have been allowed to do,

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.070 align:middle line:84%
so I would have had to slyly
go around and just tend

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:90%
to people as much as I could.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, thank
you for what you do.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think keeping
this message alive

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.560 align:middle line:84%
is so critical and so
important, don't you?

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: I do.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.850 align:middle line:10%
I think history
lives in all of us.

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:10%
It's in our past, our
present, our future.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.000 align:middle line:10%
It's connected.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.060 align:middle line:10%
And so I think it's
incredibly important

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.480 align:middle line:10%
to remember where we came from.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you took a
tour of kids to Gettysburg--

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCINVALE: Yes.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --what
would you tell them?

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:22.780 align:middle line:10%
>>MCINVALE: I would tell
them to remember, not

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.200 align:middle line:10%
just the past but to learn
of sacrifice and loyalty

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:30.040 align:middle line:10%
and belief and how every
little thing we do matters,

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.510 align:middle line:10%
no matter how long our life is.

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Courtney, thanks
