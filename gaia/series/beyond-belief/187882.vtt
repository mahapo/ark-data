>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.630 align:middle line:84%
We've got an amazing guest

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.510 align:middle line:84%

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:10%
And before continuing

on modern witchcraft,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:10%
the latest of which is
called "The Art of Witch,"

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.910 align:middle line:10%
she is sought after as
an international radio

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:10%
and television
personality, is now also

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:10%

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.299 align:middle line:10%
and you're still a witch, Fiona.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.959 align:middle line:90%
>>FIONA HORNE: [LAUGHS]

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Welcome the program.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Thank you, George.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: I'm great.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:10%
I just got-- since
sitting here with you now,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:10%
I just got back from a tour
with Def FX, the band, my band.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:10%
Funny name, I know.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:90%
It's Def FX.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I'm good.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Busy, busy.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Busy.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Always busy.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.158 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me how
the commercial pilot

00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:26.035 align:middle line:90%
business started for you.

00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I got my private
pilot's certificate

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:90%
about six years ago.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.630 align:middle line:10%
And when I was getting
it, I had a lot

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:10%
of trouble retaining
the information.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:10%
And I was thinking, what can I--

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:10%
I felt a drive to do something
useful with the skill of being

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:10%
a pilot.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I focused on wanting
to work in humanitarian aid,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and donating flying
skills to useful causes.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And my whole point
of this is how did I

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:90%
become a commercial pilot.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, in all my flying
to become a useful pilot

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and be able to volunteer
and donate the skills,

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I started just
getting a lot of hours

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.647 align:middle line:84%
and finding a lot of
opportunities to fly.

00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I was doing animal rescue
flights, all these things that

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:84%
are non-revenue generating and
allow private pilots to operate

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.148 align:middle line:90%
these kind of flights.

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And there was a point
where I just thought,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:84%
maybe I should just
do this for a job.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind
of how I ended up,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
in 2016, doing pretty
much putting myself

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:84%
through flight
school in Los Angeles

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.815 align:middle line:84%
to get all the ratings
for commercial pilot.

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I have multi engine, single
engine, commercial instrument

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:90%
rating.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.575 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: So I work as a
pilot now in the Caribbean.

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
get your license

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.202 align:middle line:84%
when you started on a
broom, by any chance?

00:02:30.202 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: [LAUGHTER] I always
say a plane is much more

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
comfortable than a
broomstick, George,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.462 align:middle line:84%
and you can fit
more people on it.

00:02:35.462 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that happen?

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Was it "The wizard of Oz"
that that started that idea

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.408 align:middle line:90%
that witches fly on brooms?

00:02:42.408 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Gosh, you know--

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Must have been

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I think there's so much
myth and sort of speculation

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.778 align:middle line:90%
around that concept.

00:02:50.778 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk to
people about, well, what

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
do I really use brooms for,
obviously sweeping the floor.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.407 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: But there's
some folklore

00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that if you want an unwanted
visitor to leave your house,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
place your magical broom
stick by the back door

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:90%
and they will leave.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And then with flying ointment
being applied, which is--

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
there's this stuff
called flying ointment.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:84%
It was talked about that witches
would apply that and then

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:90%
get on a broom and go and fly.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.692 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, modern witches, I think
we're a bit more practical.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.785 align:middle line:90%
I fly planes, not broomsticks.

00:03:20.785 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: It's more practical.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now since
we've been talking,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.670 align:middle line:84%
and we've been talking
for years now--

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.587 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yes, we have.

00:03:25.587 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --witchcraft
is perceived

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:90%
in two different ways.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
One, they talk about
the good witch.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they talk
about witchcraft

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:84%
where people really
get upset when

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:90%
they hear the word witchcraft.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.703 align:middle line:90%
You're not a bad person.

00:03:39.703 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I think it's
changed so much, George.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Since I came out of the
broom closet 20 years ago,

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, back then
witches were shrouded

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.332 align:middle line:90%
in myth, fear, suspicion.

00:03:48.332 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Burned at the stake.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Well, that
rise even further,

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.917 align:middle line:84%
like hundreds and
hundreds of years ago.

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's all happened.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.035 align:middle line:84%
But in the last 20 years,
I've seen an amazing change.

00:03:58.035 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean,
honestly these days,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't know a proud,
self-professed witch?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And actually,
George, guess what?

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.085 align:middle line:84%
We have become a
fashion statement.

00:04:06.085 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Check this out.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, let me see this.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Isn't that fabulous?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.785 align:middle line:90%
It's my favorite purse.

00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at this.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: And, I mean, I walk
around with that on my back--

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It says "witch" on it.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: --emblazoned
with the word "witch."

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you design this?

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: No.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:90%
No one gives me a hard time.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:84%
People just say, wow,
that's a cool bag.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So we've become a
fashion statement.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's, I think, with the
advent of the internet and just

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
the rise of the social
media phenomenon.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Witches of Instagram, hashtag,
millions of hits-- you know,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
it's become this kind
of cool thing to be.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:84%
But there is still a very
profound spiritual underpinning

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:84%
foundation to us, even though
we have become very trendy.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you Wiccan,
which is a religion?

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.085 align:middle line:84%
It is the religion
of witchcraft.

00:04:49.085 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not religious,
I'm spiritual.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:90%
I know a lot about Wicca.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I've written books that focus a
lot on the teachings of Wicca.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
However, myself personally,
I'm a spiritual witch

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:90%
not a religious witch.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.978 align:middle line:84%
And there's plenty of
room for individuals paths

00:05:02.978 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:90%
within the world of witchcraft.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:90%
There's a magical community.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
What I've seen change a
lot in the last 20 years

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
is that divisiveness
has kind of left us.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.083 align:middle line:84%
And we realize our strength lies
in our unity and our diversity.

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of
different types of witches,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.023 align:middle line:84%
including religious
witches, who are Wiccans.

00:05:19.023 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One of
your books-- and I

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:10%
believe it was your second
book, called "The Naked Witch,"

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.035 align:middle line:10%
you were on a
Australian television

00:05:25.035 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:10%
program talking about that.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.707 align:middle line:84%
"The Naked Witch"
is my autobiography.

00:05:28.707 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:90%
And that was actually my--

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I think my 10th or
11th book, George.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:90%
I'd lose count.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
the interviewers--

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I've been writing
books for 20 years, eh.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.837 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The interviewers
really seemed to enjoy it.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Before Fiona Horne became
the face of modern magic

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:10%
and witchcraft, the
best-selling author, radio,

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.700 align:middle line:10%
and TV personality was the
frontwoman for Aussie electro

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:10%
rock band Def FX.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.822 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC - DEF FX, "SPACE TIME
 DISCO"]

00:05:51.822 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:10%
>> (SINGING) Dancing,
the people of light.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:10%
Trash!

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.840 align:middle line:10%
The space time disco.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:10%
>> But behind the glamorous
life in the spotlight was a dark

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.150 align:middle line:10%
and troubled past, and
in her brand new memoir,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:10%
"The Naked Witch," the
51-year-old reveals her

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.825 align:middle line:10%
incredible journey of
survival and reinvention.

00:06:10.825 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that you bouncing
around there in that clip?

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: It was in
that wild outfit.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I just got to do that again
on stage, 20 years later.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:90%
It's so much fun.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is cool.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I love
performing music.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is great.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: You know.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:90%
You're a singer, too.

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I do that.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:90%
I do it for fun.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: It's a lot
of fun, isn't it?

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not like you do it.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Well, it's
just it's so beautiful

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.818 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
people and people's

00:06:27.818 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
energy in whatever
medium you do that in.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And writing the autobiography,
"The Naked Witch,"

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that was baring my soul.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I've been a rock star.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:90%
In a way, I guess I still am.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been on public
stages talking

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:90%
about modern witchcraft.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And I do all these
different things.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.718 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: But for me,
it's the opportunity

00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
to connect with people
and perhaps inspire them

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of
adventurous life that I lead,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.240 align:middle line:84%
which is as a witch, I find the
act of living a magical life

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:84%
is a perpetual act of
transformation and evolution,

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.955 align:middle line:90%
personal evolution.

00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to be
a witch to live like that.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's happening
is my message, if there is one,

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.030 align:middle line:84%
is kind of crossing over from
the kind of niche or cult

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:84%
environment into a
mainstream environment.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it always has.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about the
title, "The Naked Witch."

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: "The Naked Witch."

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's funny, because
originally the book

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
was going to be called
"50 Doesn't Suck."

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I like the
first title better.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: So "The Naked
Witch," my publishers--

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.610 align:middle line:90%
it was a chapter in the book.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was about living a very
simple life, a minimalist life,

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe even considering becoming
less, not more in life,

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.030 align:middle line:84%
not having to accumulate so much
stuff and do so much stuff--

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:84%
or have so much stuff
is more correct.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And so "The Naked Witch"
for a title was they said,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:90%
well, you're baring your soul.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And why don't we call the
book "The Naked Witch."

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
also the phenomenon

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.710 align:middle line:84%
of being skyclad in
witchcraft, which

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:90%
is naked, as if you were--

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
if God wanted you
to be naked, you

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:90%
would've been born that way.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of like we were.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's that sense of being
in a very kind of pure state.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And for me, writing
the autobiography,

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.053 align:middle line:84%
it was a trip full circle to
get to contemplate my life,

00:08:14.053 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
look at the lessons,
the journeys,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.467 align:middle line:84%
and share them with
people, and then get on

00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:90%
with the second half of my life.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, "The Naked Witch"
is kind of baring my soul.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are people shocked when
they meet you and you tell them

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:90%
you're a witch?

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Well, I don't
tell them I'm a witch.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you don't?

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: No.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Well-- and I don't tell
them I'm a pilot either.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.542 align:middle line:90%
There's a very good joke.

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:84%
How do you know there's
a pilot in the room?

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.507 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know.

00:08:34.507 --> 00:08:36.105 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: They tell you.

00:08:36.105 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So I thought when people
started saying things like that,

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm not going to be
that person that goes, "Hello.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm Fiona.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm a pilot."

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.415 align:middle line:90%
And I don't go, "Hello.

00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:43.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm Fiona.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm a witch."

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:90%
I just-- I'm just me.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.955 align:middle line:84%
And then if it comes
out in conversation

00:08:47.955 --> 00:08:48.830 align:middle line:90%
and it's appropriate.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And invariably, it
does, because I guess--

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody
recognizes you or something.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Someone recognizes
me, and it ends up happening.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.477 align:middle line:84%
And now with the
internet, I mean,

00:08:55.477 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:84%
everyone's just into
everyone's lives.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.010 align:middle line:84%
How has the internet changed,
let's say, witchcraft?

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: It's changed it a lot,
because I think witchcraft,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.610 align:middle line:84%
if you think of it
as an occult path,

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
essentially, that means
secret and hidden.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's information
and knowledge

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:90%
you have to search for.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And these days, you can
really just type in #witches

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.240 align:middle line:90%
in Instagram.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:90%
You'll get a million hits.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's--

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: There's just--
if you type the word

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:84%
witchcraft into Google,
you'll get 3 million hits.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so much
information out there now.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:90%
And that I can--

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a good
thing, because it opens up

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:90%
a lot of topics for discussion.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I see it all
as a positive thing

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and an opportunity
to share information.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And usually the negative
stereotypes of witchcraft

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:84%
are based in ignorance
and a lack of information.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So I think the information
age has actually

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:84%
been really, really healthy
for the international magical

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.270 align:middle line:84%
It's allowed us to grow
and prosper, unite,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:84%
as I was saying before,
in our diversity,

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:90%
and celebrate each other.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a really
healthy place for witchcraft

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.850 align:middle line:84%
in the modern scheme
of things, especially

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
using a tool like the internet
to communicate and share

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.100 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what exactly,
Fiona, is a modern witch?

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.157 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: A modern
witch is the same thing

00:10:13.157 --> 00:10:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that I've been saying
for the last 20 years.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.850 align:middle line:84%
It's someone that honors
nature is sacred, recognizes

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
a goddess, as well as a god,
and does spells and rituals

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:84%
to help and heal not only
themselves, but others.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
given a curse or a spell

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:90%
on somebody to harm them?

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: No.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever?

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Ever?

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.030 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.742 align:middle line:84%
I think I've certainly in
the classic sense of life

00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and the scheme of things,
I've certainly probably had

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:44.192 align:middle line:84%
a few things happen where
I've thought, wow, you know--

00:10:44.192 --> 00:10:45.650 align:middle line:84%
well, when people
point the finger,

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.483 align:middle line:84%
there's three fingers
pointing back at them.

00:10:47.483 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
It's usually people
who do really willfully

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.343 align:middle line:84%
deliberate harmful
things that end up

00:10:51.343 --> 00:10:53.135 align:middle line:84%
becoming a recipient
of their own behavior.

00:10:53.135 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It comes back.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: So I usually in my
own way pray for their healing,

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:84%
because if someone
hurts you that much,

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.962 align:middle line:84%
they're usually hurting
more themselves.

00:11:00.962 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:10%
I talk about this in my new
book, "The Art of Witch,"

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.840 align:middle line:10%
which is like my
manifesto of witchcraft.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
What have I learned
in the last 30

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
years of cons-- of more
than 30 years of deliberate

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
consciously
identifying as a witch

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and talking about it in
public for almost as long.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And I've understood
now in the journey

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.940 align:middle line:90%
that it's OK to be angry.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to hate people.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to put that--

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I know I hate-- well, there's
three people I hate now.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't hate.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: There were two.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:90%
Now there's three.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I have forgiven
everyone and everything.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.377 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I may
know of one, right?

00:11:30.377 --> 00:11:31.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: But there's three.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.172 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, they're not
who you think they are.

00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But I put them in
a box over there.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- it's not my job to
let my hatred of them known

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel that I have
to suffer because of it.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
The hatred and the anger
that I have towards them

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:90%
is not corrosive or negative.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I find it more
authentic to honor

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.150 align:middle line:84%
that I own these feelings,
and they sit over there.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And one day I can change
my mind and move on

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:84%
from having that box there,
or I can take one of them

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:90%
out and let it go.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But right now, I feel that
it's a more authentic decision

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.717 align:middle line:84%
to respect the roles that
the darker emotions of anger

00:12:05.717 --> 00:12:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and hatred have in our lives,
as long as they're not corrosive

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.342 align:middle line:90%
and become self-limiting.

00:12:09.342 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they could
be destructive though.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:90%
They could destroy you.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: No.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you have
too much hatred.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Not the way
that I manage it.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.272 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about
something very different.

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm identifying making
peace, putting it in a box.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't take any deliberate
harmful action on them.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't wish them ill.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I just accept that I have
chosen not to forgive them.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:90%
And I own my choice.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And I find that
authentic, and more--

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and it allows me to love more
and be more free for having

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.880 align:middle line:90%
just made peace with that.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: That's-- I think these
are the gifts I give myself,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that as I grow, I try
to grow not older,

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.430 align:middle line:90%
but better at living.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And I try it as a
witch and as just--

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A person.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.595 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: An everyday person.

00:12:51.595 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: And so I find--

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
misconceptions of witchcraft

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:84%
that's even more
prevalent than, say,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:84%
the stereotype of an evil
witch, which is just Hollywood.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even-- it's
not even relevant anymore.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.130 align:middle line:84%
I think it's-- the other
misconception is that

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.435 align:middle line:84%
everything has to be turned
into positive white light.

00:13:11.435 --> 00:13:12.235 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't.

00:13:12.235 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the perception.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: There is a role that
our darker emotions play.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
We go to the darkness
to learn, to grow.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
It has to be dark to
see the brightest star.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.960 align:middle line:84%
So our spiritual path honors
those dark and light aspects.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
However, people that
willfully and deliberately do

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:90%
harmful things are not powerful.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.330 align:middle line:84%
If they call themselves witches
and they consider themselves

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:90%
powerful, they're not.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
suffering and hurting.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And they become a victim
of their own darkness.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are witch wars?

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Witch wars is
kind of-- it's a fun term.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I mention it a little
bit in my new book,

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:58.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's the idea that we need
to be divided in our diversity,

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:90%
and that we're not--

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.710 align:middle line:84%
you have to be initiated
into this tradition,

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:84%
or be a part of this coven,
or be trained in this way

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:90%
to be a real witch.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.440 align:middle line:90%
And it can get divisive.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And then with some
of the younger ones

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:84%
who aren't experienced in life,
and their the social media

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:14.845 align:middle line:90%
witches on Instagram.

00:14:14.845 --> 00:14:16.262 align:middle line:84%
And doing all that,
they get a bit

00:14:16.262 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:84%
competitive with
who looks better

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.297 align:middle line:84%
in this black eyeliner or this
black lipstick or whatever.

00:14:20.297 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little
bit of immaturity

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:90%
there, emotional immaturity.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So what I like to encourage
people to consider

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.900 align:middle line:84%
is that at this point
in the evolution

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of our magical community,
that witch wars are

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:84%
no longer necessary,
and our strength

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
lies in celebrating each other,
celebrating our diversity,

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and honoring each other,
and respecting each other,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and just getting on with keeping
your own side of the street

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:90%
clean and living your life.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My exposure
to witches when I

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:90%
was a kid came from two places.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
One, of course, was "The Wizard
of Oz," that we talked about,

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and also "Hansel
and Gretel," where

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.730 align:middle line:84%
the little witch turned
every kid into gingerbread

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:90%
and put them--

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yum!

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And made them
part of her house.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: I wish I could do that.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.010 align:middle line:84%
A spell that turned things into
gingerbread, that'd be great.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
get offended when

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:84%
people talk of
witchcraft and witches

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.865 align:middle line:90%
in a very derogatory way?

00:15:06.865 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Do I get offended?

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it bother you?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.442 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: I don't hear it.

00:15:09.442 --> 00:15:11.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear the derogatory
stuff that much anymore,

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.790 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.278 align:middle line:84%
It's changed so
much in 20 years.

00:15:14.278 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because of you--

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I don't get
asked those questions.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe they don't
want to mention it around you.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: No.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't even--

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I think those kinds
of misconceptions

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:90%
are really on the way out.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there is a
wealth of positive information

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
out there, including, as
we were saying earlier,

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that the religion of
witchcraft, Wicca,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:31.943 align:middle line:90%
is a recognized world religion--

00:15:31.943 --> 00:15:33.068 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is, absolutely.

00:15:33.068 --> 00:15:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Affording all the
rights and privileges that

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:84%
the other major
religions of the world--

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Christianity,
Buddhism, all of it--

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.910 align:middle line:90%
are afforded.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think people understand
that witches, we're here.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:84%
We are a part of the
world's spiritual platform,

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I guess, or texture, mosaic
of our human evolution.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.855 align:middle line:90%
And it's a positive thing.

00:16:00.855 --> 00:16:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It's enriching a lot
of people's lives.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It's inspiring a lot
of people's lives.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.103 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you imagine
the outcry, though,

00:16:06.103 --> 00:16:07.747 align:middle line:84%
if the pope had a
meeting with witches?

00:16:07.747 --> 00:16:09.122 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: The pope
actually said--

00:16:09.122 --> 00:16:09.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People would go crazy.

00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:10%
>>HORNE: The pope actually
said something really beautiful

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.300 align:middle line:10%
recently.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
He said some people
find god in a church,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and some people
find god in nature.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.045 align:middle line:84%
And that was his way of
saying that witches are OK.

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Because
nature is our church.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:90%
We don't go into buildings.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.018 align:middle line:90%
We go outside.

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So when he said that it--
it wasn't that long ago

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.970 align:middle line:90%
that he said that.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.095 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's pretty gutsy.

00:16:30.095 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: He's very gutsy.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.495 align:middle line:10%
He's quite a magical man.

00:16:32.495 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when
we think of witches,

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:84%
we also think of
rituals and spells.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.480 align:middle line:90%
You do do that, right?

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yes!

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Rituals and spells.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:40.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I--

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.498 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:16:41.498 --> 00:16:42.707 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Well, I think--

00:16:42.707 --> 00:16:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and I talk about this in the
new book, in "Art of Witch"

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.805 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what
is the difference

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:48.013 align:middle line:90%
between a spell and a ritual?

00:16:48.013 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And what have I learned
actually really works?

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I have discovered
the secret to making

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:90%
spells work 100% of the time.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And what a spell is,
is when you would

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
get certain items
or certain objects

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and do certain things with
a certain goal in mind.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's almost like a recipe.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:90%
And you do this thing.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And you imbue it with your
will and your intention.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And the result should be what
you have asked of your spell.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:90%
The result would be that.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't always work.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And it often can be very tied
up in finite expectations

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and micromanaging the world.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And really, the biggest skill
that I have honed as a witch

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
is how to get out of my own
way and let the universe

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
work through me, and not
micromanage my life casting

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:90%
spells.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.415 align:middle line:90%
What I have learned is--

00:17:37.415 --> 00:17:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and I talk about this
in the new book--

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:47.140 align:middle line:84%
is that rituals of gratitude
are more successful in placing

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
yourself in a position in life
where there are more reasons

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.850 align:middle line:90%
to be grateful.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:84%
But I have-- and I recommend
that people do this now,

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that maybe they evolve out
of the idea of micromanaging

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
their lives by casting spells to
get a new job, get a new lover,

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.060 align:middle line:84%
or improve a
relationship, or whatever,

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and do a ritual of gratitude
for what they actually have.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And that in itself attracts
more reasons to be grateful.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
But the secret to having your
spells work 100% of the time,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I worked this out, and I talk
about it in "The Art of Witch."

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.532 align:middle line:90%
It's when I identified--

00:18:21.532 --> 00:18:23.740 align:middle line:84%
it's actually to do with
becoming a commercial pilot.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Because I mentioned
earlier in our chat

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
today that when I first
started learning to fly,

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I was having a lot of trouble
retaining the information.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
I come from a
creative environment

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.150 align:middle line:84%
where I've written
songs and books.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked in the
entertainment industry

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:90%
for decades.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And here I am becoming
a commercial pilot.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's very mechanistic.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very linear,
logical way of thinking.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not creative.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.792 align:middle line:90%
There's no gray areas.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:46.750 align:middle line:90%
It's like, you do this.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Follow the rules.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:90%
They're usually right.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.955 align:middle line:84%
You're operating
machinery at altitude.

00:18:50.955 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I work in the
transport industry.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:90%
It's very basic, you know?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: So my brain
was having trouble

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
keeping all the
information in so

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:84%
that I could do
everything I needed to do.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:90%
And I identified one day--

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I was actually traveling in
Baja California, of all places,

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and I went to a
village where there

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
were these kids
that were exhibiting

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.903 align:middle line:90%
signs of malnutrition.

00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:90%
They had rotten teeth.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Their health was really poor.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, how
is this possible when--

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.378 align:middle line:84%
you know that San
Diego's two hours away.

00:19:21.378 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Why are these kids
suffering so much?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And the lady that was there sort
of looking after the kids said,

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:84%
sometimes a flying
doctor comes in,

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and they bring with
them some medicine

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:90%
for the kids, a dentist.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
identified, wow, I'd

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.955 align:middle line:84%
like to be that pilot bringing
aid to the people in need.

00:19:35.955 --> 00:19:37.288 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To bring them in, yeah.

00:19:37.288 --> 00:19:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: So in my own way--

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.890 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget this.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:84%
I was in-- it was Bahia de
Los Angeles down in Baja

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:90%
California, which is Mexico.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And I did my own kind of ritual.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the
shore of the Bay.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:90%
And there was some--

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:90%
I traced some words in the sand.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the
universe to help me--

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:84%
my idea of a higher
power, I asked

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:84%
to help me retain the knowledge
and to be a really good pilot,

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:84%
a professional pilot even, but
someone that could consistently

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:90%
offer aid and help to people.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.523 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: If you could
just help me remember.

00:20:12.523 --> 00:20:14.770 align:middle line:84%
It was my own way of doing
a spell and a ritual.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:90%
And I kid you not, George.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
For making that intention,
my goal is to be of service.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you please help me,
high power, to do this?

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And that was what my spell was.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And then from that day on, I was
able to retain the knowledge.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:90%
I passed my tests.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I've got to a point now where
I'm a professional pilot, still

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:90%
volunteering.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.310 align:middle line:84%
My point is it was the secret
to how to make your spells work

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:90%
100% of the time.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:84%
It was by making
them be of service.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:84%
How can you identify that
the spell you're casting

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:84%
can actually serve others
and be useful in the world

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.640 align:middle line:84%
rather than serve
your finite ego.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you can id--
if you want to do a spell,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.900 align:middle line:84%
say, to get a better job, you
do the spell or the ritual of,

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:90%
how can I get a better job?

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:90%
And you do that spell.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:90%
How can it be useful?

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.260 align:middle line:84%
How can I be a happier,
more useful person

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:90%
in the world with this new job?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is how the universe
will conspire in your favor

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
every time if you identify
the purpose of your spell

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:90%
to be of service to the world.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:84%
That is the secret to making you
spells work 100% of the time.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
It's completely different to how
witches would have approached

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:90%
it once, which is I want this.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Me, me, me, I, I, I.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Now it's us, us, us.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:90%
How can I be--

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.070 align:middle line:84%
not creating change
with my will.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
How can I be willing to
be useful in the world?

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's the secret.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And I live and conduct
myself consistently

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
with that principle
every day, 24/7.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And my life is actually more
magical and more miraculous

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.530 align:middle line:84%
than I could have ever
micromanaged it to be

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:90%
by casting a bunch of spells.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is sending a
spell, casting a spell,

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:90%
like manifesting?

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.085 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Casting a
spell like manifesting--

00:21:56.085 --> 00:21:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That we create
the spell in our head

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.185 align:middle line:90%
and make these things happen.

00:21:58.185 --> 00:21:58.985 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:21:58.985 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Manifesting with our will.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a saying in
witchcraft, "As is my will,

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.568 align:middle line:90%
so mote it be."

00:22:04.568 --> 00:22:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And you sort of say
that after every spell.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.735 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
degree of that kind

00:22:07.735 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
of creating change
with your mind, what

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:90%
we think tends to happen.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I also think it's a very
powerful magical skill

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:84%
to actually step
out of your own way

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and rather than have a finite
expectation of how something

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be or
could be, but to just say,

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to show
up, do the work.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Be grateful.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Focus on being happy and
grateful for what you have.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And then say to the
universe, I trust

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.060 align:middle line:90%
you to show me the next step.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting
way to live,

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:84%
because it means you're
not trying to determine

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:90%
how your life has to look.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.950 align:middle line:84%
You focus on the
journey, and allow

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:84%
the universe to show you
where the destination is.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:84%
It's different, but I've found
it to be very fulfilling, very

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:51.530 align:middle line:90%
rewarding.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's taken me
all over the world--

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
living in the Caribbean
now, and flying airplanes,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:90%
and being open to all potential.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I just ask my idea
of a higher power

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.007 align:middle line:90%
to put me where I can be useful.

00:23:03.007 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And I just work really hard,
and then the transformation

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.140 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you be
considered unusual as a witch

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:90%
because you're a good person?

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Are there some
witches who aren't?

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Would I--

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not unusual as a witch.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm kind of showing
how witches are evolving

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and our place in society and
the world is evolving, perhaps.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:84%
As far as individuals
choosing to do things

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that aren't constructive or
contributing in a positive way

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:84%
to the world, I
think there's just

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:84%
people that are
confused and conflicted.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't categorize
them by giving them

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.130 align:middle line:90%
any label like witch.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
If there's an individual
witch that's struggling,

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
what I've found really
beautiful is that witches that

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:84%
are feeling a bit lost and
directionless in their lives

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
or challenged by
their circumstances,

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm privileged to
hear from them.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:90%
They write to me.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm very
lucky that people

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:84%
take the time to connect with
me and ask me questions, or read

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:84%
my books, or come to events
that I'm appearing at.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And invariably, I get
feedback from them

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:84%
that they've found spending
time with me useful,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:84%
or what I've shared
with them about my life

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and the dark times, and
how I've learned and grown,

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:90%
has helped them learn and grow.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
my ultimate goal,

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:84%
if I can be a useful
light on someone's path,

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and maybe inspire them to be
happier and more fulfilled

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:84%
within themselves, and then
they can share that energy

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, we got a
great response from you

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.340 align:middle line:84%
when you were on my radio
show, "Coast to Coast."

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After the fact,
people are emailing me.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And I assume you, too.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Oh, I got flooded
with-- every time I spend time

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.820 align:middle line:84%
with you, George, we get a
beautiful flow of feedback

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:90%
from people.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
people like you and I do.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We open up discussions
for conversation.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
with an opportunity

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:84%
to shine a light
into people's lives,

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and help them grow and feel
that they can, I guess,

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
step into the best version
of themselves every day.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what I try to share
with people, that I--

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.750 align:middle line:84%
they might look at my
life and see that I've

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:90%
done all these things.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, rock star, pilot, TV
host, you know all this stuff.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And I would hope that people
can understand that we

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:90%
don't have to grow older.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.360 align:middle line:90%
We can grow better at living.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.820 align:middle line:84%
We can step into the best
version of ourselves every day,

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:84%
no matter what our background,
our economic situation,

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:90%
our place in life.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:28.050 align:middle line:84%
If we consciously want
to grow and evolve,

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:84%
if we want to open
ourselves, open our minds,

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.870 align:middle line:84%
consider things,
anything possible, learn,

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and then we really
are in a position

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:84%
to live a very happy
and fulfilled life.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, this
is where the focus

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:46.020 align:middle line:84%
of "Art of Witch," my
manifesto on witchcraft,

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:84%
my autobiography, these things
that I-- these opportunities

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I get to tell my story in
the written word and share,

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I hope that that's
the message I convey

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
is that we're here to
celebrate our lives.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.367 align:middle line:90%
Life is a miracle.

00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
cast a spell, you're

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.990 align:middle line:90%
trying to accomplish something.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Can you give us an example?

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Well, I can give
you a really recent example.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.480 align:middle line:84%
When I was just on
tour in Australia

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.960 align:middle line:84%
doing a spoken word event
for my "Art of Witch" book.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And I did an interactive magical
experience with the audience.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.765 align:middle line:90%
So there was over 200 people.

00:26:19.765 --> 00:26:22.015 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the Blue
Mountains, just west of Sydney.

00:26:22.015 --> 00:26:23.600 align:middle line:90%
A very magical place.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: And we all
did a spell together.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.687 align:middle line:84%
So I invited everyone
to think of something

00:26:29.687 --> 00:26:30.770 align:middle line:90%
that they're grateful for.

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it was like
a ritual of gratitude,

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:90%
but you could call it a spell.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of bridging
both worlds, you know?

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So I invited everyone to
stand up, first and foremost.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Clear the slate.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So interlace their 10 fingers, a
little bit of witchy yoga here.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.467 align:middle line:84%
Wipe the slate
clean on the inhale,

00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:49.550 align:middle line:84%
opening themselves up to
the concept that anything

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:50.480 align:middle line:90%
is possible.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Flip their hands.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.665 align:middle line:90%
Anchor into the present moment.

00:26:53.665 --> 00:26:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And anchor into the intention
for this spell, which

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.397 align:middle line:84%
is to create more reasons
to be grateful in our lives.

00:26:58.397 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I invited everyone to
think of something that they're

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.250 align:middle line:84%
grateful for, to name
it, to give it a name,

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:84%
and to then place it in
the palm of their hands.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.770 align:middle line:90%
We've got 200 people doing this.

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's holding
their hands up.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason to be
grateful and the name

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:90%
is in the palm of their hands.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I invited everyone
to throw their reason

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.530 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful into the
center of the space.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.577 align:middle line:84%
We were all together
in this sacred space

00:27:20.577 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:90%
that was determined.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: And to name it, to
say the name, to call it out.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So this large explosion
of sound happened

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
as everyone called out the name
of what they were grateful for.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.113 align:middle line:84%
And then we allowed
those reasons

00:27:34.113 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful to
circulate in the room.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was guiding
them with my voice.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And I sang a goddess
chant to energize

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:84%
the reasons to be grateful,
and to have them magnetize,

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and become something that
could attract more reasons

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.010 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful into
the lives of everyone.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So I sang this goddess
chant, which goes--

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll sing it for you.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) Isis, Astarte, Diana,
Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.105 align:middle line:84%
And I sang that over
and over and over.

00:28:02.105 --> 00:28:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And you could feel the
energy building in the room.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's arms are up.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.738 align:middle line:90%
And this energy is building.

00:28:07.738 --> 00:28:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I said the incantation,
"By one, this spell is done.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.660 align:middle line:90%
By two, it shall come true.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.280 align:middle line:90%
By three, so must it be.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.600 align:middle line:90%
By four, for the good of all.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:90%
By five, our dreams come alive."

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:90%
And it was like this--

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:84%
it was everyone sort
of just went [GASPING]

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and felt this shift
of energy in the room.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.960 align:middle line:90%
And that was the spell cast.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the result. The
amount of emails and messages

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.768 align:middle line:84%
I got on Facebook from people
saying, oh, my god, my life

00:28:30.768 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:90%
was transformed in that moment.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.477 align:middle line:84%
The next day, this happened,
this happened, this happened.

00:28:34.477 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Or my reason to be, to feel
joyful in life came true,

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:90%
and I was transformed.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is weeks later
I'm getting this feedback

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:90%
from people.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.480 align:middle line:84%
So I would consider that most
recently a dramatic spell.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.082 align:middle line:84%
And it shows that you don't need
a lot of fancy tools and props.

00:28:51.082 --> 00:28:52.040 align:middle line:90%
And we think of spells.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.290 align:middle line:84%
We think, oh, we've got to
have all these candles, all

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:57.240 align:middle line:84%
these crystals, this exotic
herb from the far-flung corner

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.040 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's not necessary.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.200 align:middle line:84%
A spell or a ritual that
creates profound transformation

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and positive
transformation in life

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:84%
can happen just with your
desire, your willingness

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:84%
to believe anything is possible,
breath, movement, sound,

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.588 align:middle line:90%
and intention.

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been one of
the most dramatic spells you've

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:20.578 align:middle line:90%
ever cast that happened?

00:29:20.578 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: What's dramatic?

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.995 align:middle line:84%
What would you
consider dramatic?

00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Typically, dramatic
is something maybe emotional,

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:90%
maybe highly unusual.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah!

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or something
like that, where even you

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.640 align:middle line:84%
went into it thinking,
gosh, I don't

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:84%
know if this is going to work,
and all of a sudden, it did.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.995 align:middle line:84%
And something dramatic
happened for someone.

00:29:39.995 --> 00:29:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: You know, as
you're saying this,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:84%
the thing that I think of
is probably not what you're

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.752 align:middle line:90%
going to expect me to say.

00:29:45.752 --> 00:29:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we would
think that I would

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:52.070 align:middle line:84%
be like, oh, my gosh, on the
full moon, super full moon,

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
ultra eclipse, I
lit 107 candles.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.958 align:middle line:90%
And I know I did this and that.

00:29:57.958 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it happened.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.208 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: And it all happened.

00:30:00.208 --> 00:30:03.260 align:middle line:84%
You know what the biggest spell
I think I cast in my life was?

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I say my life, but my
life's a work of magic.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Getting sober seven
years ago now.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For you?

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: When I last
saw you on this show,

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I was six months sober.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Getting sober in a program, and
what I learned in that journey,

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.920 align:middle line:84%
because alcohol had become
a very destructive force

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.530 align:middle line:84%
in my life after a series of
very sad and difficult events.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you cast
a spell on yourself.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: I feel like--

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.610 align:middle line:84%
what you defined, like
dramatic, amazing,

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.770 align:middle line:84%
it was these sort
extraordinarily steps.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.660 align:middle line:10%
>>HORNE: The result, it worked,
I would say getting sober

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.500 align:middle line:10%
and staying sober, and
just the gifts of sobriety,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:10%
what that's bought in my life,
because it's opened my life up

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:48.990 align:middle line:10%
to really living a--

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:53.153 align:middle line:10%
to having a beautiful,
authentic, and a whole--

00:30:53.153 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Like whole in the
sense of healthy on every level.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not only physically
sober, I'm emotionally sober.

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not just not putting
toxic substances in my body.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:10.945 align:middle line:84%
It's not putting toxic
thoughts into my mind.

00:31:10.945 --> 00:31:14.410 align:middle line:84%
I manage what I watch,
as far as television,

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:84%
or what I read, as far as social
media, or magazines, articles.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I really endeavor to
only engage and put

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:84%
into my life and self
things that inspire

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:84%
and help me be the
best version of myself

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.670 align:middle line:90%
that I can be one day at a time.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I would have
to say getting sober

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.254 align:middle line:90%
is my biggest act of magic.

00:31:40.254 --> 00:31:41.054 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:31:41.054 --> 00:31:42.471 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk more
about your spells.

00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Mitch Horowitz is
a cult historian.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Mhm.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.692 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he appeared
on "Beyond Belief"

00:31:46.692 --> 00:31:49.625 align:middle line:90%
with me some time ago.

00:31:49.625 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:10%
Our final email, we
have one from Seattle.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:54.065 align:middle line:10%
It says, I'm a mother
in Seattle, Mitch.

00:31:54.065 --> 00:31:56.780 align:middle line:10%
And my high school-aged
daughter is involved

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.090 align:middle line:10%
with Wicca or witchcraft.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.520 align:middle line:10%
I find pentagrams
on her notebooks.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.380 align:middle line:10%
I was told these
things are evil.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.713 align:middle line:10%
Should I be concerned about her?

00:32:04.713 --> 00:32:06.172 align:middle line:10%
>>MITCH HOROWITZ:
You know, George,

00:32:06.172 --> 00:32:07.550 align:middle line:10%
I get this question frequently.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:10%
And as a parent of two boys,
I take it very seriously.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:10%
And I say this, Wiccan
kids are good kids.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.430 align:middle line:10%
They're sensitive.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:10%
They're independent.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:10%
They're curious.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:21.650 align:middle line:10%
No parent who finds
that their kid is

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.510 align:middle line:10%
getting into Wicca or
witchcraft should be worried.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.180 align:middle line:10%
It's not evil.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.490 align:middle line:10%
It's an ancient
nature-based religion that's

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.500 align:middle line:10%
experienced a revival today.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.520 align:middle line:10%
It's ethical.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.080 align:middle line:10%
It's socially concerned.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.730 align:middle line:10%
And kids who are
into Wicca, I find

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:10%
to be some of the most
sensitive, most trustworthy

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.425 align:middle line:10%
kids you can come across.

00:32:39.425 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now, are
all witches Wiccan?

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.655 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well, the term
is used interchangeably.

00:32:43.655 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or if you're a
Wiccan, are you a witch?

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.873 align:middle line:10%
>>HOROWITZ: Well,
the fact is the term

00:32:46.873 --> 00:32:49.910 align:middle line:10%
Wiccan is an Old English
term for clever folk.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:53.150 align:middle line:10%
And it was occasionally
used during the revival

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.130 align:middle line:10%
of witchcraft in the 1950s.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:10%
But it's become
a term of choice.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.900 align:middle line:10%
Most people who call themselves
witches or neopagan would also

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:10%
say, yeah, I'm Wiccan.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.973 align:middle line:10%
It's an umbrella
term that's embraced.

00:33:03.973 --> 00:33:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
agree with him?

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yes!

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
say anything else.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Mitch.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.907 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:33:08.907 --> 00:33:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Brilliantly summed it.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's a good guy.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah, he's a good guy.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, he
loves the occult.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he dabbles
with it all the time.

00:33:14.955 --> 00:33:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Well, how he summarized
all that is just perfect.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:90%
My job is done.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.952 align:middle line:90%
He's done it.

00:33:19.952 --> 00:33:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what is magic when
it has to do with witchcraft?

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: You know,
I think the best

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:84%
way I could answer that
is magic is something

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:84%
that anyone, whether
they're a witch or not,

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:36.620 align:middle line:90%
can experience and explore.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the idea of
what magic could be

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.230 align:middle line:84%
is the act of transformation,
creating change.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.975 align:middle line:90%
And I would say that--

00:33:44.975 --> 00:33:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and again, it's
such a broad term.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Even when I talk about
living a magical life,

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:52.010 align:middle line:84%
it's living a
transformative life.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
As I was mentioning earlier,
you don't have to grow older.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.310 align:middle line:84%
You can grow better at
living and see your life

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:84%
as an evolving miracle and a
celebration of self and others

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.033 align:middle line:90%
and community and life.

00:34:07.033 --> 00:34:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
works, doesn't it?

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: It really does.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.010 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to
believe in it for it to work?

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I think belief is
another interesting term.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that sometimes you
can be feeling directionless

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:29.179 align:middle line:84%
and lost, and maybe like
you've lost your ability

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:30.949 align:middle line:90%
to believe in anything.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:33.949 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that dissolution
of ego, where you just

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.830 align:middle line:84%
become like a blank
slate, like I felt

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.850 align:middle line:84%
like that when I was at that
dark place I mentioned earlier.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
drink myself to death.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.195 align:middle line:90%
I was so sad.

00:34:44.195 --> 00:34:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I never knew that.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.362 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Seven years ago.

00:34:46.362 --> 00:34:48.380 align:middle line:84%
It was at the end of
a long relationship.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.179 align:middle line:90%
I loved the person very much.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.170 align:middle line:90%
It all changed.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it was this
terribly dark, sad time.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:56.969 align:middle line:84%
But I became like a
blank slate, like me,

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.450 align:middle line:84%
the witch, the
dynamic person that

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.633 align:middle line:84%
does everything was at a point
7 years ago where I just--

00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were giving up.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: I just couldn't--

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know
anything anymore.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.480 align:middle line:90%
And I was a blank slate.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that blank
slate that I became

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.980 align:middle line:84%
allowed my idea of a higher
power to write on it for me

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.000 align:middle line:90%
and say, do this.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And so there was one thing
I've got really good at for all

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.850 align:middle line:90%
the failures in my life.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I've got very good at not
giving up, I found out.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment, I
felt in my darkest moment

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.290 align:middle line:90%
there was that tiny spark.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.132 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: And I let that--

00:35:33.132 --> 00:35:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I went to the light,
and I let it grow.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.217 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: So my point
is that, to me, was

00:35:37.217 --> 00:35:38.870 align:middle line:90%
a transformative act of magic.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:90%
So believing in magic.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when people
feel really lost

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and like all hope is
gone, it can actually

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.530 align:middle line:84%
be a really beautiful
turning point.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they just have to
allow themselves to consider

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.730 align:middle line:90%
that that's possible.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people sometimes
will turn to tarot cards.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yes.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What exactly are they?

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Tarot cards
are a tool of divination

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.020 align:middle line:90%
that are amazing and wonderful.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's the Major
Arcana, the Minor Arcana.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a ton of cards,
a ton of meanings, a ton

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:90%
of stuff to do with them.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And they can be a wonderful
tool to explore and learn.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much every witch
is drawn to some kind

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.480 align:middle line:84%
of tool of divination,
whether it be tarot,

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.760 align:middle line:84%
whether it be oracle,
whether it be runes,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.930 align:middle line:84%
whether it be some kind of
esoteric tool of understanding

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.058 align:middle line:84%
where they've come from,
where they're at now,

00:36:26.058 --> 00:36:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and where they're likely
to go, and also offering

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that as a service to
others to help guide

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:84%
others through their
lives, or on their paths,

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and maybe navigate obstacles.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:40.637 align:middle line:84%
So that's the purpose of
tarot cards-- fortune telling.

00:36:40.637 --> 00:36:42.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at tarot cards.

00:36:42.095 --> 00:36:45.980 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Playing cards that
can reveal the future?

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.635 align:middle line:10%
Some say they are a window
into another space and time.

00:36:52.635 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:90%


00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:10%
It's been claimed
they are the remnants

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:05.090 align:middle line:10%
of ancient esoteric wisdom, a
long lost book of secrets whose

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:11.160 align:middle line:10%
symbols both hide and
reveal important knowledge.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:10%
The 78 intriguing and
perplexing tarot cards

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.860 align:middle line:10%
have been feared by some
as the devil's playthings.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps for very good reason.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that
they are neither

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:31.770 align:middle line:10%
an ancient book nor the key
to the mysteries of life,

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.990 align:middle line:10%
but simply an odd
deck of playing cards

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:37.680 align:middle line:10%
that have gained an
undeserved reputation?

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.420 align:middle line:10%
You might be in for
a surprise as we

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.340 align:middle line:10%
turn to the tarot
cards themselves

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:43.065 align:middle line:10%
to get some answers
to these riddles.

00:37:43.065 --> 00:37:45.990 align:middle line:90%


00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who
determines the outcome

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.950 align:middle line:90%
of the tarot cards, Fiona?

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it the reader
or the individual

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that the cards are
being read for?

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Interesting.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:00.240 align:middle line:84%
When I read tarot, I try
to stay out of the way

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and let the guidance
come through me.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the biggest
skill I've learned

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:08.610 align:middle line:84%
to sort of hone is not to
feel it's coming from me,

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.280 align:middle line:90%
but coming through me.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.030 align:middle line:84%
When I use tarot,
it's like I say

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:19.110 align:middle line:84%
to my client, the person
I'm reading for, I'm

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.730 align:middle line:90%
a bit like a meteorologist.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:21.767 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to look at--

00:38:21.767 --> 00:38:23.850 align:middle line:84%
who's determining what
weather is going to happen.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I look at the high pressure
system, the low pressure

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:84%
system, the fronts,
the this and the that.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And to the best of my
ability, the tarot cards

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.770 align:middle line:90%
become symbols like that.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And to the best of my
ability, I interpret them all,

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.348 align:middle line:84%
and tell the person,
whether it's going--

00:38:36.348 --> 00:38:38.640 align:middle line:84%
what's to happen in their
lives the next day, or what's

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:43.260 align:middle line:84%
going on now, and how they can
have guidance to successfully

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.030 align:middle line:90%
navigate obstacles.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So what I find fascinating when
I read the cards for people--

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and I have people I read for
all over the world using Skype.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:54.780 align:middle line:90%
And often, I can't see them.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:55.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the phone with them.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I actually find the
readings to be more accurate

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.980 align:middle line:84%
the less I know about the
person and if I can't see them,

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.460 align:middle line:84%
because I'm letting the
information come through.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.710 align:middle line:90%
So I do think there is a--

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.920 align:middle line:84%
well, I've experienced,
the reality of my life

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.940 align:middle line:84%
is that I've experienced them
to be profound tools of healing

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.320 align:middle line:90%
and help in people's lives.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.200 align:middle line:90%


00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And if someone doesn't
consider that possible,

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:26.080 align:middle line:84%
then their reality
is equally valid.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.170 align:middle line:90%
It's just different to mine.

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:84%
The people that I've helped
with the cards, the way

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.880 align:middle line:84%
that I've experienced
the cards in my own life,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.440 align:middle line:90%
they've been very helpful.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful,
exciting skill to explore.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And I've been reading the
cards now for over 30 years.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I have the same deck that
I've had all those years.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.850 align:middle line:84%
It's all the symbols,
it's all rubbed off.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.850 align:middle line:84%
The cards have been shuffled
and read thousands of times

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:90%
literally.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, right.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Authentic.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: And it's-- and
yet, I still feel it,

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:58.020 align:middle line:90%
and I still know it.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.290 align:middle line:84%
However, there is a
difference between tarot cards

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.990 align:middle line:84%
and Oracle Cards and
recording oracle cards.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Oracle cards have become another
very popular tool of divination

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.520 align:middle line:90%
in recent times.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.580 align:middle line:84%
If you go into any bookstore
or any esoteric store,

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.820 align:middle line:84%
there's literally
hundreds of decks now.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:19.540 align:middle line:84%
They're generally numbered--
there can be 70 of them.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.470 align:middle line:84%
but generally, the decks,
there's not as many--

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:28.440 align:middle line:84%
36 to 40, something somewhere
in that sort of amount of cards.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.750 align:middle line:84%
The pictures on them can
be different and determined

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:84%
by the creator of
the oracle deck.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.950 align:middle line:84%
The meanings can be
different and unique

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.590 align:middle line:84%
created by the creator
of the oracle deck.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:38.930 align:middle line:90%
I've created an oracle deck.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, you do.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Let me see those.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: This is my debut
oracle, the "Magick of You

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Oracle."

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.237 align:middle line:10%
They just-- as you
and I are talking,

00:40:44.237 --> 00:40:45.570 align:middle line:10%
they've literally just come out.

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:46.940 align:middle line:10%
I actually pulled them
out for you to show you.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, you did?

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:47.670 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:10%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.610 align:middle line:90%
To make it easy.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:53.580 align:middle line:84%
But I'm so thrilled to have
had the opportunity to do this,

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.487 align:middle line:84%
because having read
tarot for so long,

00:40:55.487 --> 00:40:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and then having the
opportunity to actually create

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.730 align:middle line:84%
an oracle deck of my own,
it was, well, what can

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:01.350 align:middle line:90%
I offer that's useful?

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think when the
individual reader is trying

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.140 align:middle line:84%
to read cards for
themselves, it can

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:11.160 align:middle line:84%
be very hard to determine what
is guidance coming through,

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and what is kind of
what you want to see.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So I designed this oracle
deck for the reader

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.350 align:middle line:90%
to read for themselves.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:19.800 align:middle line:84%
They can also use it for
other people in service,

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:84%
but I particularly
put it together,

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:26.105 align:middle line:84%
the 36 cards, to have
meanings that can actually

00:41:26.105 --> 00:41:28.230 align:middle line:84%
guide the reader and help
navigate their obstacles,

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.890 align:middle line:84%
literally unlock their
hidden truths, so to speak.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, can you
do a reading for me?

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: I could, if you'd like.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do we do?

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: OK.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm shuffling.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Just say stop when
you feel ready.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stop.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: OK.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So pull the top
card from the deck.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.285 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:41:48.285 --> 00:41:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Let's see what you got.

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can I see?

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.300 align:middle line:90%
What did you get?

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.250 align:middle line:90%


00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Opulence.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Oh, how beautiful.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Opulence, it's
your time to lead.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:03.120 align:middle line:84%
The opulence card comes
along at a point in life

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.840 align:middle line:84%
where it's time for you
to take charge and lead.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're already doing that.

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:10.350 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Off camera, if I'm
allowed to say,

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.332 align:middle line:84%
you and I were
talking about the fact

00:42:13.332 --> 00:42:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that you have worked pretty
much 24/7 for 17 years.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Is that right, George?

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It doesn't stop.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I mean,
whether it's radio,

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:21.570 align:middle line:84%
whether it's TV, whether
it's live performances,

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:84%
you haven't taken a
week off in 17 years.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you and I
were discussing it,

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:28.470 align:middle line:84%
it's like, well, is there a
time where you should stop?

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Is there a time where you should
step aside or take a break?

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And this card actually means no.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.483 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keep going, right?

00:42:36.483 --> 00:42:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Keep going, George.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:38.610 align:middle line:90%
It's your time to lead.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.350 align:middle line:84%
You wear the crown
of leadership.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And it means-- the
meaning in this deck

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.540 align:middle line:84%
is it's a place in the
world that is well-earned.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And people do look to you
for guidance and inspiration.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's your duty to lead.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.000 align:middle line:90%
So guess what.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.110 align:middle line:84%
No holidays in the
near future for you.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, my friend.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.792 align:middle line:90%
You've got to keep working hard.

00:42:58.792 --> 00:43:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the oracle cards
reinforce what we already know,

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:02.750 align:middle line:90%
in this case?

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Sometimes the
guidance will come through,

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and it will be what
you already know.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes-- and
I actually say this--

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.633 align:middle line:84%
there's a little book that
comes with the cards that also--

00:43:10.633 --> 00:43:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like an
instruction book, yeah.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.217 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: It's like the
meanings of everything,

00:43:14.217 --> 00:43:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and a ritual that
comes with each card.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And I offer the ritual as a
way of anchoring the guidance

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:24.680 align:middle line:90%
that you get in the cards.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes what you get told
will be the opposite of what

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:31.600 align:middle line:90%
you think, and sometimes not.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's an affirmation.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.725 align:middle line:84%
And it lets you know that
you're on the right path,

00:43:35.725 --> 00:43:38.100 align:middle line:84%
that you're on the path that
is determined to be the best

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.470 align:middle line:84%
version of you, you
being the most useful

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:41.605 align:middle line:90%
you can be in the world.

00:43:41.605 --> 00:43:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: And that's how these
can guide the individual.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But what I also offer
with these cards is

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.910 align:middle line:84%
if you're using a
traditional tarot deck,

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and you've done a
big tarot spread,

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.108 align:middle line:84%
and you've got the
Celtic cross laid out,

00:43:54.108 --> 00:43:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing all that, you
pull one of the "Magick of You

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Oracles."

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:00.660 align:middle line:90%
And I just got the key here.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes the
key to unlocking

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:04.980 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom and the insight.

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.797 align:middle line:84%
So I love that I've been
able to sort of create

00:44:08.797 --> 00:44:09.630 align:middle line:90%
something like this.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.170 align:middle line:84%
My publishers,
Rockpool Publishing,

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:14.500 align:middle line:84%
have been so kind to give
me these opportunities.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Even as I'm flying
airplanes, they say, hey,

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.340 align:middle line:90%
you got another book in you?

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.048 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to do a
deck of oracle cards?

00:44:19.048 --> 00:44:20.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.990 align:middle line:90%
I'll show up, and I'll do this.

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:23.907 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
seen a witch fly by you

00:44:23.907 --> 00:44:25.092 align:middle line:90%
when you're in a plane?

00:44:25.092 --> 00:44:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Some people
send me really

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:30.270 align:middle line:84%
funny like GIFs and things
of witches flying by.

00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen that,
but I have seen UFOs.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have seen UFOs.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:35.390 align:middle line:90%
What do you think they are?

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.594 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: I know.

00:44:35.594 --> 00:44:37.725 align:middle line:84%
As a commercial pilot, I
wonder if anyone from the FAA

00:44:37.725 --> 00:44:39.892 align:middle line:84%
is watching this right now
and considering I'm nuts.

00:44:39.892 --> 00:44:42.268 align:middle line:84%
No, the US Navy just
released a whole lot

00:44:42.268 --> 00:44:43.560 align:middle line:90%
of videos of what they've seen.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:43.848 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They've seen some.

00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:44.648 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I've seen some stuff,
George, that I can't explain.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it in
the daytime flying.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.200 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen it at night.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.330 align:middle line:84%
The most unusual
things, I think,

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.970 align:middle line:84%
are the fun phenomenon
you see during the day,

00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:00.330 align:middle line:84%
because at night,
it's star light.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I fly in the Caribbean
over a lot of open water.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.098 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: When I was
flying the newspapers

00:45:05.098 --> 00:45:07.650 align:middle line:84%
at night, interisland newspaper
services-- my glamorous job.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I get up at 2:00 in
the morning, load

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.190 align:middle line:84%
300 pounds of
newspapers in the plane,

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:12.960 align:middle line:90%
and fly them to another island.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.737 align:middle line:84%
But those nights when I'm
flying over the dark ocean,

00:45:15.737 --> 00:45:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and you've got some light
on an island over there.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:18.620 align:middle line:90%
You've got stars.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.856 align:middle line:90%
You've got lights on boats.

00:45:19.856 --> 00:45:21.106 align:middle line:90%
It can be very disorientating.

00:45:21.106 --> 00:45:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: So you can't trust
the light you're looking at,

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.210 align:middle line:90%
that it's a star, or anything.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But when you see a
light moving like this.

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Zigzag, stopping,
starting, that's weird.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm moving-- my cruise
speed in an Aztec, the planes

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that I fly and deliver the
papers in, I'm probably at 130,

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.000 align:middle line:84%
140 knots indicated,
depending on what's going on?

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you always
by yourself, too,

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:43.900 align:middle line:90%
when you're flying?

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yes.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.748 align:middle line:84%
And it's beautiful
flying at night alone.

00:45:45.748 --> 00:45:47.320 align:middle line:90%
I love that part of my job.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.627 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that
I'm going at a speed.

00:45:51.627 --> 00:45:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm seeing something
off in the distance,

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's moving
like this, I know

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.620 align:middle line:84%
that that's not something
that is designed

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.280 align:middle line:84%
to function the way that
the aircraft that I'm in

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.280 align:middle line:90%
is designed to function.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A plane can't do that.

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: No.

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:08.190 align:middle line:84%
So I have seen things like
that on more than one occasion.

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.180 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I've got about 1,000
hours in the air now.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But I've definitely
seen it happen.

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:18.045 align:middle line:84%
And then during the day is
when it's even more strange.

00:46:18.045 --> 00:46:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And the things I've
seen during the day

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:22.830 align:middle line:84%
have been these odd little kind
of-- well, they look little,

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:23.850 align:middle line:90%
because they're up high.

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.410 align:middle line:90%
But they're like a gray--

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:26.910 align:middle line:84%
from what I can
see, it almost looks

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:28.410 align:middle line:90%
like a hexagonal kind of shape.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.040 align:middle line:90%
And they do the same thing.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you call
that in sometimes?

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: I have.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:34.020 align:middle line:90%
I have called it into NASA.

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a reporting thing
that you can call in,

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:39.370 align:middle line:90%
citing unidentified objects.

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I have.

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we talked
earlier about you being a pilot,

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:43.130 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:44.204 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:46:44.204 --> 00:46:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Hey.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting in an airplane.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.170 align:middle line:90%
This is my new life.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm-- it's hectic,
and it's great.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm a busy international
Caribbean charter

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.416 align:middle line:84%
pilot, about to take off
when my passengers arrive.

00:47:00.416 --> 00:47:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm currently
waiting in San Juan.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But this isn't
goodbye, Australia,

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.030 align:middle line:84%
because this upcoming
tour I'm doing,

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:11.160 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be the last one.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.840 align:middle line:84%
The last one to
come out and talk

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.320 align:middle line:84%
about witchcraft, the last
one to play with Def FX.

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to focus on all
of this kind of stuff now.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's just--

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I've been thinking
about it, and this has

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:27.660 align:middle line:90%
to be the last time for that.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be a
farewell tour for me to you.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And Australia's
always in my heart.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to stay out
here and focus on my job now,

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:40.788 align:middle line:90%
which is being a pilot.

00:47:40.788 --> 00:47:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you fly
a plane like that, Fiona?

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:45.000 align:middle line:84%
It looks like you can't
even see over the top.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: You can.

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.160 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can see it.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: It's funny.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.640 align:middle line:90%
That was filmed--

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I filmed that on the ground
at San Juan International

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Airport in Puerto Rico just
before I went out to Australia

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:59.873 align:middle line:84%
to do my farewell
tour, just recently

00:47:59.873 --> 00:48:01.290 align:middle line:84%
at the time of you
and I speaking.

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Because I--
being a pilot, yeah,

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:05.918 align:middle line:90%
it's a demanding job.

00:48:05.918 --> 00:48:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And as you kind of grow in your
hours and grow in your goals,

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.190 align:middle line:84%
you can't spread
yourself so thin

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:13.030 align:middle line:84%
as to be doing so
many different things.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.460 align:middle line:90%
But you train to--

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I used to
get into a plane.

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And even in the days where I
was like kind of working busily

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.190 align:middle line:84%
on TV and on the
cover of magazines,

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'd get on a private
jet as a celebrity whatever

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.890 align:middle line:90%
being flown somewhere.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'd always look left
to the cockpit, thinking,

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.905 align:middle line:90%
I wish I could be up there.

00:48:31.905 --> 00:48:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go and sit
down in the plane.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And these days, now I
do get into the plane,

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.710 align:middle line:90%
and I sit there.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:39.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's my office.

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:40.638 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:48:40.638 --> 00:48:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Believe it or not,
I know what all those dials

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:43.730 align:middle line:90%
and things are.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:44.700 align:middle line:90%
And I do my job.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're trained to do.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.990 align:middle line:90%
We operate those airplanes.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fascinating, amazing
environment to be a part of.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I feel very blessed
to be doing it.

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of hard work.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's been-- any other
pilots out there would know.

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we'll talk
amongst themselves,

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, we're bus
drivers in the sky.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:10.590 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day, you're
operating a vessel of transport

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.850 align:middle line:90%
in the air and on the ground.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does it
mean by your last tour?

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Well, the last tour--

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.040 align:middle line:90%
you can never say never, George.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're too
young for a last tour.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:23.905 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I just felt when
I made that announcement

00:49:23.905 --> 00:49:25.530 align:middle line:84%
that it was important
to sort of create

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:28.812 align:middle line:84%
some boundaries in my life,
and not spread myself too thin.

00:49:28.812 --> 00:49:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And as a professional
pilot, I need

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:33.570 align:middle line:90%
to focus solely on aviation.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.190 align:middle line:84%
However, we never say never
in life, George, do we?

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.456 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't.

00:49:36.456 --> 00:49:37.320 align:middle line:90%
You never say never.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.362 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Never say never.

00:49:38.362 --> 00:49:43.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have a personal
creed that you live by?

00:49:43.645 --> 00:49:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Like "Grow not older, but
better at living," or something

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:46.190 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that has
become the statement

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:53.840 align:middle line:84%
that I think about
every day is how can I--

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
buy into the myth

00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that we're destined to grow old,
get sick, and die expensively.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I just don't live
my life like that.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So I've just as you and I
are talking now have just

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.460 align:middle line:90%
turned 53 in linear years.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is a number that
often women in particular

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:14.770 align:middle line:84%
are told we've reached
our use-by date.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer--
that sort of idea

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:22.640 align:middle line:84%
that as you grow in life, that
it's an inevitable decline.

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And I actually have experienced
a very different way of living.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I truly believe that we
can grow not older, but better

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.060 align:middle line:90%
at living.

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And a big part of that is
being sober and living--

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: A healthy life, a
consciously healthy life.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But not just physically,
emotionally and spiritually.

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that is my
personal creed.

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And I share that in my latest
book, "The Art of Witch,"

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.690 align:middle line:84%
this manifesto of
living a magical life.

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're a witch or
not, these are all the things

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I've learned in all these
years of practicing witchcraft,

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and how it can be applied
to a practical way of living

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:06.340 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And living a
magical evolved life

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:12.620 align:middle line:84%
is an act of transformation,
growing, evolving,

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.480 align:middle line:90%
growing better at living.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you cast
spells for yourself a lot?

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: For myself, I do
rituals of gratitude now.

00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I just-- if I'm doing anything,
I affirm what I'm grateful for.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting here,
and I get like life is--

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.640 align:middle line:90%
it's funny.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Life can be really
challenging, even when

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:35.870 align:middle line:84%
you're living a very proactive,
evolved, sober, healthy, useful

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:37.520 align:middle line:90%
life in service of others.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.658 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: You still get
these massive curveballs

00:51:39.658 --> 00:51:43.640 align:middle line:84%
thrown at you, where you're just
like, OK, universe, all right.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to--

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're testing you.

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.667 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: They're testing me.

00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:49.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I see now is
opportunity is not-- it's

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:52.370 align:middle line:84%
not the calamity and the
scale of destruction,

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:55.070 align:middle line:90%
devastation that defines you.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:58.310 align:middle line:84%
It's what you do in the face of
it, which is how I discovered

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.650 align:middle line:90%
the secret of hurricane magic.

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which, again, is?

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Hurricane magic
is something that--

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and this-- the last time you
and I spoke on "Coast to Coast,"

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd literally just survived two
catastrophic hurricanes that

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.870 align:middle line:84%
hit the Caribbean and
the island I live on,

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:15.300 align:middle line:90%
the island of Saint Thomas.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was devastating.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Devastating.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Two cat 5's within two weeks.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:20.450 align:middle line:90%
We had one.

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We had Irma come in
and just decimate us.

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Horrible.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: And then nine days
later, whatever it was,

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:26.030 align:middle line:90%
12 days later--

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the time then was
just I don't even know.

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But just about two weeks
later, Maria came through.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
the people that I

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:36.890 align:middle line:84%
knew that died and
were lost, that

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:38.750 align:middle line:84%
happened in the
second hurricane,

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:41.360 align:middle line:90%
because we were so damaged.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:43.580 align:middle line:84%
There was not a
leaf left on a tree.

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:46.010 align:middle line:84%
It was just everything
was just torn asunder,

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.470 align:middle line:84%
like nuclear bombs
dropped on the island.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: And it was
just so horrific.

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:54.190 align:middle line:90%
And then Maria came in.

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And the floods
and the mudslides,

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:59.270 align:middle line:84%
it's just that was when the
people I knew that died,

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that passed in
that second storm.

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So what do we learn
from hurricane magic?

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm a witch.

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.540 align:middle line:90%
I look to nature for guidance.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And nature is my bible.

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:14.637 align:middle line:84%
So I walked outside into this
world that was just destroyed.

00:53:14.637 --> 00:53:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Devastated.

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: On every level--

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and asked my idea of a higher
power, mother nature, why?

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Why was this necessary?

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not--
it's not only the humans

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:28.560 align:middle line:90%
that have been decimated.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.810 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Every flower, every
tree, every bird gone.

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:36.323 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- how
is this necessary?

00:53:36.323 --> 00:53:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like an
angry planet for reason.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: It was extraordinary.

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And yet, and yet, what
I learned through going

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:43.370 align:middle line:84%
through these
catastrophic hurricanes

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:47.630 align:middle line:84%
was that nature recovered
very-- relatively very quickly.

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Humans took quite a bit longer.

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Two years after at the time
of you and I speaking now,

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:55.130 align:middle line:84%
it's still ongoing,
this process of recovery

00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:57.210 align:middle line:90%
and rebuild for the humans.

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.390 align:middle line:84%
However, nature
recovered very quickly.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And what I noticed was it was
like a pruning and a cleansing

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.210 align:middle line:90%
as things grew back.

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So for example, there was an
introduced vine on the island.

00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It was this orange, ugly,
straggly, thorny vine

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that would grow like a
shroud over trees and plants.

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: And that
orange vine was just

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:19.430 align:middle line:90%
blasted away in the storms.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.260 align:middle line:90%
I haven't-- it hasn't come back.

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:24.290 align:middle line:84%
The trees are growing
more vibrantly.

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:26.990 align:middle line:84%
We've never had more
fruit on the mango trees.

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Unusual.

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:29.877 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: The
flamboyant trees that

00:54:29.877 --> 00:54:31.400 align:middle line:84%
are blooming now
in the second year

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:36.650 align:middle line:84%
since the storms are the most
colorful bright red with just

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:37.790 align:middle line:90%
prolific flowers.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:39.110 align:middle line:84%
They're always a
beautiful flowering tree,

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:41.580 align:middle line:84%
but just all of us who live
on the islands are just going,

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.790 align:middle line:84%
wow, nature is
just coming through

00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:47.420 align:middle line:84%
with so much vigor and so
much life for the pruning

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.540 align:middle line:90%
that she had.

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And then those of
us living on island

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:54.380 align:middle line:84%
who survived the storms,
we're like, a lot of people

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.320 align:middle line:84%
left, and maybe they were people
we didn't need to have here.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have finite
resources on the islands.

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.885 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been a pruning
of the land, of the people.

00:55:03.885 --> 00:55:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.383 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: And maybe that's what
it means, hurricane magic.

00:55:07.383 --> 00:55:08.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what I learned.

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about it
in "The Art of Witch."

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I talk about it in these--

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:16.490 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a hurricane in our
heads, in our relationships,

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:21.170 align:middle line:84%
literally on the land around
us, it can be an act of pruning,

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and we can become truly
grateful for what we have.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And we can understand
that maybe we

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.730 align:middle line:84%
don't need so much to
be happy and to prosper,

00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and that the liberation of
stuff, things being taken away,

00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.710 align:middle line:84%
can actually allow a more pure
and authentic sense of self

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:38.670 align:middle line:90%
and existence to come through.

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've
learned hurricane magic is.

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.590 align:middle line:84%
But I really, George,
I really don't

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:45.440 align:middle line:84%
want to go through two
catastrophic hurricanes again.

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I don't blame you.

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:47.072 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: And the
clean up from those.

00:55:47.072 --> 00:55:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And then here I am
doing aid work for Haiti

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:52.940 align:middle line:84%
in 2016, flying in
aid for them, flying

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:56.000 align:middle line:84%
in chickens that can
grow to hens to lay eggs,

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.220 align:middle line:84%
flying in seed that
grow in a cup of soil,

00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.700 align:middle line:84%
because there was no soil left
in Haiti after those storms.

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:02.553 align:middle line:90%
And it's in 2018.

00:56:02.553 --> 00:56:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're still
devastated by it.

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.303 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Still devastated.

00:56:05.303 --> 00:56:08.518 align:middle line:84%
And then I become a recipient
of aid the following year,

00:56:08.518 --> 00:56:10.560 align:middle line:84%
because I go through two
catastrophic hurricanes.

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you learn
that life is really--

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:20.150 align:middle line:84%
it's an exercise in
honoring what you have,

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:21.692 align:middle line:84%
and being grateful
for what you have.

00:56:21.692 --> 00:56:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I was doing the
aid missions to Haiti,

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:27.530 align:middle line:84%
I have never met
lovelier, more grateful,

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:29.540 align:middle line:90%
kind people than the Haitians.

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:30.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a lot of
good people on this planet.

00:56:30.645 --> 00:56:31.895 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: A lot of good people.

00:56:31.895 --> 00:56:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Because when you've had
everything taken away.

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does the
future hold for Fiona Horne?

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: The future for me?

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Gosh.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that I can
never say never.

00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I will do another
book about witchcraft.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:51.180 align:middle line:84%
In all of the drawing that
line in the sand and saying,

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is it, and I'm
going to focus solely

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:59.040 align:middle line:84%
on being a professional pilot,
I've had the universe show me

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.040 align:middle line:84%
that maybe there's still
a few more things to do

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and a few more
things to be said.

00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.460 align:middle line:90%
So maybe I'll still be around.

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll sit here
in this chair with you

00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:09.320 align:middle line:84%
in the next six years, George,
and have another chat with you.

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:11.190 align:middle line:84%
But I am going to
focus on flying.

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And I am going to focus
on finding opportunities

00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:15.810 align:middle line:84%
to be of service and useful,
and also work as a pilot,

00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and put some bread on the
table and a roof over my head.

00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has witchcraft
evolved over the years?

00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Because what it was in
the 1700s and 1800s,

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:26.870 align:middle line:90%
sure different than today.

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yes.

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where's it going
to be 20 years from now?

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.155 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I think
it will continue

00:57:31.155 --> 00:57:33.440 align:middle line:84%
to grow and evolve,
and be a useful tool

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:38.480 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual expression in
the human scheme of things.

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a really,
really positive thing.

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:47.100 align:middle line:84%
If I can share quickly
something, a vision I had.

00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: Quite a
while ago, when I

00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:51.590 align:middle line:84%
was doing the television show
"Mad Mad House" for the SyFy

00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:52.430 align:middle line:90%
channel.

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And I had an opportunity to
just be a witch 24/7 when

00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I was on camera for that show,
hosting that show as the witch.

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And I had a meditation and
a hawk, a bird, a hawk.

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.458 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I was
sitting in a garden.

00:58:07.458 --> 00:58:09.080 align:middle line:90%
A hawk flew in front of me.

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.870 align:middle line:90%
And the hawk spoke to me.

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And I know I can say
this without sounding

00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:13.923 align:middle line:90%
too strange on it on this show.

00:58:13.923 --> 00:58:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't
judge on this program.

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:17.298 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: You don't
judge on this program.

00:58:17.298 --> 00:58:18.770 align:middle line:90%
So the hawk spoke to me.

00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And the hawk said, Fiona, look
at all the trees in the garden.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around, and
there was many beautiful trees

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:27.570 align:middle line:90%
where I was.

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And the hawk said, do you
understand that the tree

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.380 align:middle line:90%
is the same and yet different?

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around, and I
saw there was an oak tree,

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.700 align:middle line:90%
a jacaranda tree, a gum tree.

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the
hawk, I understand.

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And the hawk said,
do you understand

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that the survival of the tree
depends on its diversity?

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And I considered that,
and I thought, yes, I

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.430 align:middle line:90%
understand biodiversity.

00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:52.890 align:middle line:84%
It's an essential
component of life.

00:58:52.890 --> 00:58:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the
hawk, I understand.

00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
I started to pick up

00:58:57.710 --> 00:59:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that the hawk was
God speaking to me.

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But God as I had learned to
experience God as a young girl

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:06.960 align:middle line:84%
growing up Catholic,
and being taught

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.960 align:middle line:84%
that God was the father,
God sitting in the sky,

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:09.950 align:middle line:90%
quite judgemental.

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And so it was this father
Christian God speaking to me

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:15.350 align:middle line:90%
through the hawk.

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And so this father
Christian God says,

00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:20.210 align:middle line:84%
so you understand that
the survival of the tree

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:22.280 align:middle line:90%
depends on its diversity.

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.970 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, I do.

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, so it
is with my love.

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:30.230 align:middle line:84%
My survival depends on
the diversity of my love.

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So every spiritual path, every
religion is an instrument,

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and when those instruments
are played together,

00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:40.760 align:middle line:84%
they become a symphony,
a symphony of the soul.

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is my voice,
the voice of God.

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment, I have
this wave of comprehension

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:50.880 align:middle line:84%
go through me that the Christian
father God that I had grown up

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.498 align:middle line:84%
with, that I had been taught
that was if you're not

00:59:53.498 --> 00:59:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Christian, you're damned.

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.700 align:middle line:84%
If you're not Catholic,
you're damned.

00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:00.750 align:middle line:84%
This very God was telling me
that its survival depended

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:03.190 align:middle line:90%
on its diversity of expression.

01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So every spiritual
path, every religion

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:10.870 align:middle line:84%
is essential to the voice of
God, the voice of the divine.

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So when I understood that,
when that went through me,

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I realized that as
a witch, I have--

01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm an essential instrument
in the symphony of the soul.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And all witches are.

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And everyone that
is-- every human that

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.720 align:middle line:84%
is expressing and experiencing
a spiritual or religious life

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.840 align:middle line:84%
is essential to the
voice of the divine.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the divine wants
us to play our instruments.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that is why,
I think, witches

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and the international
magical community

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
will continue to grow, prosper,
share, and contribute usefully

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:44.280 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you select
yourself to become a witch

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.380 align:middle line:90%
or did it just happen?

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HORNE: I think I just awoke
to the fact that I am a witch.

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And as a young girl
growing up in Australia

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and always out in
the bush playing,

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and I felt that
natural environment

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:06.805 align:middle line:84%
was where-- it was where I felt
most fully realized and joyful.

01:01:06.805 --> 01:01:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Comfortable.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.722 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: And comfortable.

01:01:08.722 --> 01:01:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And just that I had an
interactive relationship

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.010 align:middle line:90%
with the divine.

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I would go to the Catholic
churches of my youth

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and be told when to stand,
when to sit, when to kneel,

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.460 align:middle line:90%
what to say.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.080 align:middle line:90%
And it just didn't--

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel close to
God, an idea of God.

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But when I was out
in nature, I did.

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.640 align:middle line:90%
I felt that I was--

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.142 align:middle line:84%
I had a profound
spiritual awareness.

01:01:32.142 --> 01:01:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a young
child, you don't

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
have all those
terms to explain it,

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
but there was a feeling I had
that I was one with everything.

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:41.520 align:middle line:10%
And that my life had
meaning and purpose.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.960 align:middle line:10%
And so then as I grew into
understanding what a witch is

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:51.300 align:middle line:10%
and feeling that it was the most
authentic expression of myself,

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:56.560 align:middle line:10%
it became about always
finding the divine in nature,

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.980 align:middle line:10%
living a purposeful,
useful, and happy life,

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:01.440 align:middle line:10%
and healing and helping others.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- so yeah, that's
how I just know I'm a witch.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.217 align:middle line:84%
And that's just--
it's just who--

01:02:08.217 --> 01:02:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is what it is.

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if people
want to get a hold of you,

01:02:12.175 --> 01:02:13.050 align:middle line:90%
how do they find you?

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:15.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HORNE: FionaHorne.com,
my website.

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:16.568 align:middle line:10%
F-I-O-N-A-H-O-R-N-E dot-com.

01:02:16.568 --> 01:02:18.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Got to get
that E in there, right?

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:18.570 align:middle line:10%
>>HORNE: Yeah.

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:19.800 align:middle line:10%
Got to get the E in there.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.600 align:middle line:90%
FionaHorne.com.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.115 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
an area there

01:02:22.115 --> 01:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
where you can
click and email me.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And then my Facebook,
good old Facebook,

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's just
Facebook.com/FionaHorneOfficial.

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:32.462 align:middle line:84%
But with all the
links on my website,

01:02:32.462 --> 01:02:33.420 align:middle line:90%
you can get to it, too.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.863 align:middle line:90%
So I respond to every email.

01:02:35.863 --> 01:02:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Every comment.

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm like you.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.410 align:middle line:84%
We're very much aware that
our place to communicate

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
comes because people
are interested in what

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:46.980 align:middle line:90%
we're saying and sharing.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We are there, and
where we are because of them.

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:50.632 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Because of them.

01:02:50.632 --> 01:02:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It's all about everyone else.

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:56.320 align:middle line:84%
So I just feel very grateful to
be able to connect with people.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.463 align:middle line:84%
And I really love
hearing from people.

01:02:58.463 --> 01:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fiona, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HORNE: Thank you, George.

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.168 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When you
think of a witch,

01:03:03.168 --> 01:03:06.350 align:middle line:10%
you think of "The Wizard of Oz"
on a broom with that cackle.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.010 align:middle line:10%
But when you talk
with Fiona Horne,

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:10.230 align:middle line:10%
you realize that's
really not the case,

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:12.960 align:middle line:10%
that there are some great
witches out there who

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.030 align:middle line:10%
really care about humanity.

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:24.502 align:middle line:90%
