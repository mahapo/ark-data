00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.695 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:10.319 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:13.330 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.565 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.210 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.284 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.284 --> 00:00:27.700 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, as you know,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:10%
Captain Kirk once said,
"Space, the final frontier."

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.490 align:middle line:10%
But is it?

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.530 align:middle line:10%
So much is going on in
this planet that requires,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:10%
of course, incredible research
and in depth work by humans.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And we've got Bob Zimmerman
here on "Beyond Belief"

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
to talk about, not only
things going on up there,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.437 align:middle line:84%
but things that are
going on right here.

00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Bob, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT ZIMMERMAN: My pleasure
to be here again, George.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.646 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: By the
way, I should say,

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:10%
your book, "Genesis, The story
of Apollo 8," now available,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:10%
high technology, it's an ebook.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:10%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Ebook,
that's right.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.934 align:middle line:90%
People can get it in ebook.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And the good thing about the
ebook is images are in color,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
you get all the images, you
get, in fact, additional things

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:90%
from the hardback edition, so.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I put a new forward in
there, and it's good stuff.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.713 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's-- technology
is a great thing, George.

00:01:13.713 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you
so interested in space?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well, from
the very beginning,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.635 align:middle line:90%
I'm into exploration.

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm into.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:10%
And exploration is
not just simply going

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:10%
where no one has
ever gone before.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:10%
Though space epitomizes that.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Exploration is answering
questions that are a mystery.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So for example, scientists
doing research in a laboratory,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
they're going where no
one's ever gone before.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.869 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to solve
a mysterious problem.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So, that's one of the reasons
I have a real fascination

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:90%
for science.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm a science journalist, I do
writing on that kind of stuff.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.725 align:middle line:84%
Because they are
on the cutting edge

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
as well, though it
might not appear so,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:84%
going to the
laboratory every day,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and working on a
computer every day.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:10%
But there are unknown questions
that need to get answered,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:10%
and as I've said, my
website's Behind the Black,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:10%
and that's trying to
answer those questions that

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.300 align:middle line:10%
are hidden behind the black.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:90%
And the black is mystery.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
The universe, the reality
of the universe in some ways

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.000 align:middle line:90%
is a veil.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And human beings, we
have to work our utmost

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:90%
to lift that veil.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:90%
To see what's hidden behind.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's what got me in
space, because space epitomizes

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.042 align:middle line:90%
that search for the unknown.

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's one of
the reasons I write

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.791 align:middle line:90%
about science and other things.

00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Because they are doing
the same kind of things.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:84%
It's why I like to
go caving, George.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Caving, I get to go where
no one's ever gone before.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's geology.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:84%
That's a different
world down there, too.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's a different
world, but at the same time,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.093 align:middle line:90%
it's the same thing.

00:02:37.093 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
pushing that envelope.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Not only just going to
get to go places no one's

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
ever gone before,
but the geology.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.572 align:middle line:84%
Learning something about how a
cave forms is a question mark,

00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and how do you answer
that question mark.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's just fascinating
to study and learn.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
got me into space.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have we lost
the glamour of space?

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember July, 1969,
hovered around the television

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:84%
with my dad, watching Neil
Armstrong setting foot

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:90%
on the moon.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:90%
That was historical.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But then later on,
even the networks

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:90%
lost interest in missions.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:84%
They just weren't
interested anymore.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Are we at that point today?

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Absolutely not.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
rejuvenate us?

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:90%
To get national interest again?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: There is a
schizophrenia, a split

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
personality within the United
States nation, in our culture.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:84%
There is an
intellectual disinterest

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:90%
in this kind of thing.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
But I think the general
public of the United States

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is passionate for
exploration of all kinds.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
That's why science is a
top interest people have.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, before
the web existed,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
the mass media was very limited,
and they had their interests,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.596 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't interested
in some of this stuff.

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:50.845 align:middle line:90%
But the public was interested.

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: And when
the internet came along,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
suddenly the mass
media had to shift

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and cover this stuff again,
because suddenly everyone

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.810 align:middle line:84%
was going to the internet to
get the information, and not

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.860 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:84%
For years they would not cover
space exploration at all.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:90%
They would just not cover it.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, NASA sends a little
Rover to the moon, Pathfinder.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Sojourner.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:90%
And they set up a web page.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And within the first two
days of that Rover's landing,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
that web page got
a billion hits.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly-- and that tells
you what the real interest was.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Just because editors at
mainstream television networks

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.902 align:middle line:84%
and newspapers don't
want to cover a subject,

00:04:32.902 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean we don't
have that interest.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: And
the fact that there

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.810 align:middle line:84%
are many people willing to
give very large sums of money

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to Richard Branson
at Virgin Galactic

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
to fly suborbital
flights, tells me there

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:90%
is a great deal of interest.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:90%
That we haven't lost this.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of fuddy
duddies who have lost it.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
But they're irrelevant
to the game.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.644 align:middle line:84%
The public and the
American culture

00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:84%
is into exploration
of our galaxy.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.972 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, it's exciting
how the Mars 1 group wants to--

00:05:00.972 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: One way mission.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.638 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A one way
mission to Mars.

00:05:03.638 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Would you do that?

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: No, I
wouldn't do that.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Neither would I.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: No,
but, you know, and I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
think none of the people
who volunteered seriously

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:84%
took it-- they did it to support
the idea of going to Mars,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:90%
not so much going one way.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
probably don't think

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be picked.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.612 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Yeah.

00:05:16.612 --> 00:05:17.987 align:middle line:84%
And even if they
are picked, they

00:05:17.987 --> 00:05:20.700 align:middle line:84%
don't expect it to happen as a
one way mission, and that's OK.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.530 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to support
the idea of doing

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:90%
great and wonderful things.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing planet.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing universe.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's an amazing mind of a
human being that gets us there,

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Yeah.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:90%
We-- human beings are imperfect.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:90%
We're not perfect creatures.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
We recognize that
we're imperfect,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:90%
and we cannot become perfect.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But what makes us really
noble and interesting

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.054 align:middle line:84%
is that we strive
for perfection.

00:05:50.054 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:84%
We still strive to be perfect,
even though we can't do it.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So perfection involves striving
to find out what's the unknown.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.565 align:middle line:90%
Pushing the envelope.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, doing things that
have never been done before.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.752 align:middle line:84%
Being a race car driver, trying
to drive a vehicle faster

00:06:03.752 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:84%
on the ground than
anyone's ever done it.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.576 align:middle line:84%
Or Felix Baumgartner,
going up as high as he can,

00:06:10.576 --> 00:06:13.009 align:middle line:84%
and then doing a parachute
jump from space, essentially.

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, with
his camera on his head.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Yes.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but people are
willing to do things

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:84%
because they want
to push the envelope

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and try to do things that
have never been done before.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.910 align:middle line:90%
To reach beyond.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what humans are like.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is
an argument brewing

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:84%
on this planet about
climate change.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.180 align:middle line:84%
The argument is right
down the middle.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:84%
You've got a group of people
who believe that mankind

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.247 align:middle line:84%
is creating this disaster
of climate change.

00:06:40.247 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got a camp
out there, which includes me,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Includes me.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
believes that we're

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
going through Earth's cycles,
that these things have

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.220 align:middle line:84%
happened, will happen, and
that's just the way it is.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, is mankind
contributing to pollution?

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.820 align:middle line:84%
We need to clean
up the environment.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.350 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about that.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of pure
Earth climate change,

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%
I think we're in a cycle.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.025 align:middle line:84%
And I think the planet
just continues to do this.

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: The thing
about climate science,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:84%
I've written about this
quite a bit, George.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Is that, it is science, but it's
an incredibly uncertain science

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.050 align:middle line:84%
The amount of information
that scientists

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
have about what's going on with
our climate is very limited.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
They really do
not yet understand

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:90%
the climate in great depth.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:84%
We only began studying
the climate in great depth

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.170 align:middle line:90%
with the onset of the space age.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Because prior to that, we
didn't have a good reading

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.170 align:middle line:84%
of what the sun's
radiation output was--

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, we didn't
have the satellites available.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: We didn't
have the satellites.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.324 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what
the Earth's climate

00:07:41.324 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:90%
numbers were really like.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's only since
like 1978 that we

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.850 align:middle line:84%
started to get really good
numbers about climate.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So for anyone right now to state
that the science is settled

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:90%
is downright lying.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I have to say that.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:90%
So you say there are two camps.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think the camps really
divide up into two groups,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:84%
very different than
how you described it.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
You've got the scientists
group, the real scientists, who

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:84%
are skeptical, who
understand the uncertainties.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.564 align:middle line:84%
Some believe human
behavior is a danger--

00:08:12.564 --> 00:08:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And not very vocal.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.479 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Yeah.

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And, but should be truly
dealt with, but are skeptical.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Some-- this is all in
that scientific group--

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and then you've
got the politicos

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.829 align:middle line:84%
in the science world, who
are corrupting the science.

00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is something I really
want us to discuss here.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
corrupting the science.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not just simply that
the science is unsettled,

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:84%
there are actually
scientists out there

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.750 align:middle line:84%
right now that have
committed fraud

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:84%
to make it look like one, the
climate is warming more than it

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:84%
is, and to make it look like
humans caused more of it

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:90%
than they did.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And this has been now
documented several times.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've brought you some of
that information because it's

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.824 align:middle line:84%
very clearly shown that
it's not just simply

00:08:54.824 --> 00:08:56.740 align:middle line:84%
there's a debate between
scientists about what

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:90%
this uncertain science is about.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:84%
There are some scientists who
want to squelch the debate

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and have included
fraudulent data to try

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.050 align:middle line:90%
to squelch that debate.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why try to
perpetrate the fraud?

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.627 align:middle line:90%
What are they getting out of it?

00:09:10.627 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's a mixed thing.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are just
emotionally passionate,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and they fear humans are
causing the climate to warm.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.130 align:middle line:84%
They just sincerely
believe that.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But good intentions
are the road to hell.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.299 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have
too many intentions,

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and are too passionate,
and therefore

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%
have lost the ability to calm
down, and be good scientists,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.141 align:middle line:90%
and look at the data.

00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Part of it is money.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The real money in
the climate field

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
right now is supporting
global warming.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Because governments are backing
that conclusion aggressively

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:90%
with big research funds.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you come out
and say well, the data

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.199 align:middle line:84%
isn't really showing
heavy global warming,

00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
you're not gonna
get the grant money.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You won't
get the funding.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: You'll
have a great deal

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:84%
of difficulty getting
the grant funds.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And there is a, unfortunately,
a peer pressure situation

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:84%
now in that
scientific community,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.410 align:middle line:84%
forcing scientists to come out
in favor of global warming.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you the
number of scientists

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
who were in this field, who when
I wanted to ask them questions

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
about this debate,
would get reluctant,

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.202 align:middle line:84%
and then some of them actually
would leave the field.

00:10:16.202 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:84%
They'd go off and
do other research

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.560 align:middle line:84%
because this is too
touchy, and too hard.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want
to do bad science,

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:84%
so they'd rather get out of
the field of climate field.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a hot potato?

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.889 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's
a very hot potato.

00:10:26.889 --> 00:10:31.285 align:middle line:84%
You have cases where scientists,
for example, NOAA and NASA.

00:10:31.285 --> 00:10:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And we have a
graph to show this.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:10%
NOAA and NASA have actually
taken old climate surface data

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:10%
from the '30s.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.340 align:middle line:10%
In the '30s, the data had
shown that the climate had

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:10%
gotten warm for a period of
time, and then cooled off.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the last decade,
if you look at the data now,

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
suddenly that warm
period has disappeared.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it's kind of
like a straight line.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets warm again.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
What they've done is they
adjust the numbers consistently,

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
in NOAA and NASA,
to make it appear

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:84%
as if the climate
is only warming now.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's to fuel the debate--

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.840 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: That
the Earth is warming,

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and the fossil fuel
industries are putting

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere,

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, the
climate is warming.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:90%
We have to do something.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually a manipulation
of the data, and fraudulent.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, you have a
guy like Michael Mann.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
He's a scientist, he's
a climate scientist.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.177 align:middle line:84%
He came up with something
called the "hockey stick graph."

00:11:37.177 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:90%
What does the hockey stick mean?

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, what
does a hockey stick

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:90%
have to do with climate change?

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.271 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well, his hockey
stick graph, basically starting

00:11:43.271 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:84%
from the year 1000, shows
that the Earth's climate was

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:90%
basically no change.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:84%
It fluctuates, but
basically pretty level.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.470 align:middle line:90%
No warming at all.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:90%
At all.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Until suddenly around
1800, when fossil

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
fuel industrial
revolution began.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:90%
And then suddenly, boom.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:90%
You get a warming.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's a hockey
stick, right?

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's an outright fraud.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And many scientists
know this data is false.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.400 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, incredible
amounts of data

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:84%
exist that documents that
in the year around 1000,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.590 align:middle line:84%
you had a period of what they
call the medieval warm period.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.855 align:middle line:84%
So the hockey stick had
a bump going up and down.

00:12:26.855 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he
didn't show that.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.605 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: He
didn't show that.

00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, around 1600, during
a period when we had no sun

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:90%
spots, by the way--

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:35.591 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And no industry.

00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:37.444 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: No, and
no real industry,

00:12:37.444 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
you have something
called the Little Ice

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Age, where the
climate went down.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.006 align:middle line:84%
The hockey stick
had a bump down.

00:12:44.006 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't show that.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.120 align:middle line:84%
He smoothed it out, except
for the Industrial Revolution.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On purpose.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: On-- well, that's
an interesting question.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:90%
He would claim no.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:90%
The data shows this.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:84%
But other people have
taken his raw information,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and the algorithms he used
to produce that hockey

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
stick, and they've put
random data in of all kinds.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what data you
put into his algorithms that

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.130 align:middle line:84%
produced his hockey stick-- no
matter what data you put in,

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:90%
you get a hockey stick.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So, he's actually created a
situation where no matter way

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.270 align:middle line:84%
data comes up, it's
a hockey stick.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:90%
That's fraud.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:90%
That's fraud.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.760 align:middle line:90%
It's outright fraud.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:10%
In addition, and this is
very important about this,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:10%
in addition, the people who
put this hockey stick graph

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:10%
together-- and this hockey
stick graph was put together

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.050 align:middle line:10%
for something called the
IPCC, The International Panel

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:10%
for Climate Change.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.767 align:middle line:10%
It's a UN panel, it
issues a report--

00:13:35.767 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Very vocal.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.599 align:middle line:10%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Very vocal.

00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It issues a big report
every five years or so.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Right now, they're issuing the
newest report at this moment.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:84%
But when they issued their last
report in '07, it included this

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:90%
hockey stick graph.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
that hockey stick graph,

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:84%
what it does, is it shows many
different proxy informations

00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:90%
for data.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Things like tree ring data,
solar data, temperature data,

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.710 align:middle line:84%
surface data, satellite
data on the climate.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:10%
So it shows many different
lines, different colors,

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:10%
for all these datas.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:10%
And once again, his
hockey stick shows

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:10%
that as you get towards the
20th century, all of them

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:10%
seem to point up.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:10%
But interestingly enough,
the tree ring data,

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.785 align:middle line:10%
you can see this, like,
it's a yellow amber line,

00:14:23.785 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:10%
it goes bouncing around.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:10%
It starts to go up, and then--
it's like a spaghetti graph.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.319 align:middle line:10%
There's lots of little
lines on top of each other.

00:14:30.319 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Offshoots.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It kind of
disappears into the graph.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the published hockey
stick you see published.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:10%
Well, some scientists
did some research

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:10%
and discovered that if you
took that tree ring data

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:10%
out, and just published
that line by itself,

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.343 align:middle line:10%
it didn't just go up.

00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:10%
It then suddenly went down.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:84%
The last 30, 40
years, tree ring data

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:84%
is not showing the
climate warming.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:10%
It's showing the
climate cooling.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And how did
they explain that?

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:10%
>>ZIMMERMAN: What they did
is they didn't explain it.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:10%
This is where the
phrase from the climate

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:03.730 align:middle line:10%
gate emails, "hide the
decline" comes from.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.414 align:middle line:84%
What these guys actually did,
and it included Michael Mann

00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and a few other scientists
like Philip Jones--

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they clearly
knew the decline was there.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Yeah.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
They knew the data
showed this decline,

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:84%
but that decline would disprove
the theory of global warming.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Or it would raise
great questions

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.345 align:middle line:84%
of the uncertainties
of the science.

00:15:21.345 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:90%
So what did they do?

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:90%
They took it out.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.050 align:middle line:90%
They just simply took it out.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just take it out.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Took it out.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, data that was
actually being obtained--

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't want to
explain it, take it out.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.122 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Take it out.

00:15:30.122 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't do
that in science.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.102 align:middle line:90%
That's outright fraud.

00:15:33.102 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:90%
That's not how science works.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Science works, you
gather the data,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and you develop your
theories from the data.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, the IPCC published--
in their IPCC reports,

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
they published a graph
showing all the computer

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
models of what's going
to happen down the road.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And all these computer models--
they're squiggled lines,

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and they show that the climate's
going to start warming.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:90%
The lines go up, the lines go--

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
They have like, there's about
72 different climate models,

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:84%
computer models, that
have been developed,

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:90%
saying the same thing.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.970 align:middle line:84%
All of them showing
some variation.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:84%
The climate is going
to warm significantly.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And these were from the
reports of the IPCC in '90,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:90%
in '94, in '97, in 2001.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:84%
All those early IPCC
show these graphs

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:84%
showing the temperature's
going to rise significantly.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Well in 1998, the
temperature stopped rising.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, while all the models
show these squiggly lines

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:90%
going up.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, in '98, suddenly the
climate started to be stable.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And we've had now for almost 18
years, no significant warming

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.880 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So the graph, when you look
at this, you suddenly see,

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.980 align:middle line:90%
well, gee.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Scientists who are certain the
science is settled, that models

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:90%
show it's going to get warmer.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:84%
But then when you look at the
satellite and surface data,

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.180 align:middle line:90%
those models are 100% wrong.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're doing good
science, what do you do then?

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:90%
You throw the models out.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:84%
You write new
models that will try

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:84%
to explain why this
climate hasn't changed.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not what's
happened in the climate field.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.480 align:middle line:84%
What instead happens
now in the climate field

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:90%
is a refusal to accept the data.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They would see
that, and throw it out.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Throw the data out.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.104 align:middle line:84%
Well now, how can
you have good science

00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:90%
in a situation like this?

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a major problem
the climate field has.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:90%
For example, Phil Jones.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.050 align:middle line:84%
He's a guy in charge of what's
called the Climate Research

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Unit in England.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is a guy who, for
decades, has been gathering

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.750 align:middle line:84%
surface data of the
Earth's climate.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Oceans, surface data, weather
station data on the continents.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
It is his data that Michael
Mann used in the hockey

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.310 align:middle line:84%
stick to show that in
the last 200 years,

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
the climate has
warmed significantly.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the scientist
asked him, look.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.890 align:middle line:90%
This is science.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
We would like to
confirm your data.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Could you give us your raw
data so that we can check it?

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:90%
For years, he refused.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
They actually had to go to
Freedom of Information Act

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:90%
demands to get the data.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, he
admitted, well, I lost it.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I lost it.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: That's the quote.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.460 align:middle line:84%
That's his exact words to the
Freedom of Information demand.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:90%
The data has been lost.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist anymore.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:90%
The raw data.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.344 align:middle line:90%
So, all of--

00:18:19.344 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unacceptable.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's unacceptable.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And he is actually quoted
in almost every science

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.250 align:middle line:90%
report you can imagine.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:90%
His papers are reported.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But every one of his
papers is unreliable

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:84%
because his surface data is not
available to other scientists

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:90%
to check and confirm.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.454 align:middle line:84%
There is very big corruption
in the climate field right now,

00:18:38.454 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and it has to be
addressed, and it

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
has to be addressed
hard by the citizenry.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Now this doesn't say
that climate change

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and global warming
might not be happening.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm not arguing that point.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.660 align:middle line:90%
There are question marks.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:84%
There is no question
that we are increasing

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:84%
the amount of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:90%
There's no question of that.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But how much influence
it has on the climate

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:90%
is an unknown right now.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's even more of an unknown
because too many scientists

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:84%
in that field have
been willing to corrupt

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:84%
the field for the
sake of politics,

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.397 align:middle line:84%
rather than let
the data lead us.

00:19:15.397 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Speak for itself.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Speak for itself.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can
we be getting off

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:84%
the coldest winter in 20
years if the climate is

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be getting warmer?

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: This is-- you're
asking a very good, skeptical,

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:90%
scientific question.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.100 align:middle line:84%
According to the global warming
models, all 72 climate models--

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:84%
all of them based on this
theory of carbon dioxide

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
causing the temperature
to warm-- as the carbon

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
dioxide rises, the
temperature's supposed

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:90%
to rise in lockstep with it.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.855 align:middle line:90%
Well, it hasn't.

00:19:45.855 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:84%
For the last 18 years, 17
years, we've seen no warming.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And like you say,
the last few winters

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:84%
have been brutal
winters, worldwide.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Not just in the United States.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.074 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
coldest in 20 years.

00:19:58.074 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: So there's
a question here.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.207 align:middle line:90%
Then what is really going on?

00:20:01.207 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, we don't know.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:90%
This is good science.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.290 align:middle line:84%
The sun might be
a factor in this.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:90%
It might be.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.460 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.380 align:middle line:84%
There could be other factors on
the ground, volcanic activity,

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:90%
we don't know.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.610 align:middle line:90%
This is an unknown.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Good science means, well,
now we have this data,

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.870 align:middle line:84%
follow the data, and let's
come up with better models.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's come up
with some solutions.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: And we're
not doing that right now.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the worst
part of this right

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
now is that too many
scientists right now

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.380 align:middle line:84%
are willing to--
if anyone raises

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.820 align:middle line:84%
skeptical questions, this
is the basis of science,

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:90%
is skepticism.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:84%
It's now become a dirty
word in the climate field

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:90%
to be called a skeptic.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
highest honor you can

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:84%
give a scientist,
to be a skeptic.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's even
worse than that now.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of climate scientists
will call a skeptic

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:90%
a climate denialist.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:84%
They're using this--
they took the word

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:90%
from holocaust denialists.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.595 align:middle line:84%
The people who want to make
believe that the holocaust

00:20:55.595 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:90%
during World War II--

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:57.697 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Doj-- Dinejads.

00:20:57.697 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: That's right.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:90%
It did not happen.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're now applying
it to scientists

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:84%
who are just simply being
skeptical about global warming.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:84%
That is a terrible thing
for the field of science.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It makes it very difficult
for science to function right.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Because for science
to function right,

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
the thing that counts
most is the data.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And the data, if the
data finds-- you find out

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.460 align:middle line:84%
you're wrong, then you have
to change your theories

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.480 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.931 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
like, the theory was

00:21:24.931 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
the earth was the center
of the universe, right?

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:27.763 align:middle line:90%
That was the theory.

00:21:27.763 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:84%
The data seemed--
Ptolemy, it seemed

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
to say that was the
correct solution.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.917 align:middle line:84%
Well, the data started
to show that was wrong.

00:21:34.917 --> 00:21:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Well then, you don't
say the data was wrong,

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:90%
the earth is still the center.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:84%
You say like
Copernicus, no, we have

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.812 align:middle line:84%
to rechange the theories
to fit the facts.

00:21:42.812 --> 00:21:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And in this case,
the climate field

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:84%
is struggling
because there are too

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:84%
many people with power
in it that are not

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.091 align:middle line:84%
allowing the data
to rule right now.

00:21:50.091 --> 00:21:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a very big problem.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You brought
us some graphics.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
We just looked at
the hockey stick.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.255 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:21:56.255 --> 00:21:57.755 align:middle line:10%
>>ZIMMERMAN: You
can see right here,

00:21:57.755 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:10%
all those squiggles going up
are the predictions of how

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:10%
the climate was going to go.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:10%
This was all the predictions.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.927 align:middle line:10%
These were all written in the
'90s and in the '00s by climate

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:11.260 align:middle line:10%
scientists who said carbon
dioxide was going to increase

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:10%
the climate, and you're seeing
how the climate was going

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.310 align:middle line:10%
to increase in the '00s, and
in the '20s, and in the '30s.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's dramatic.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:10%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's dramatic.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:10%
Look how the lines go up.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.970 align:middle line:10%
But look at the two
lines near the bottom.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:10%
The kind of darker brown
and the greenish line.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Kind of like
going across the plane.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:10%
>>ZIMMERMAN: That's
the actual data.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:10%
That's the actual satellite
and Earth's surface data.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, the bottom
line here is, OK,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:10%
that means every one of
those models is garbage.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.496 align:middle line:10%
They don't predict the future.

00:22:35.496 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they didn't
predict the past either.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.078 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take
those computer models

00:22:39.078 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and plug it into the
temperature in 1900,

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and then ask those computer
models to predict what

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:84%
the weather was in
the 20th century,

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
none of those models
20 years ago--

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They would
not have done that.

00:22:49.325 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: They
would not predict

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:90%
what the weather actually was.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you saying all
these scientists are doing this

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:55.970 align:middle line:90%
fraudulently?

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Some of
this is not fraudulent.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I'd say a significant
portion of that research work

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.260 align:middle line:84%
with that graph
is not fraudulent.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.324 align:middle line:84%
It's-- some people think,
well, carbon dioxide increases,

00:23:07.324 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
it's going to increase the
warmth of the atmosphere.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.700 align:middle line:90%
So they produce a climate model.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.920 align:middle line:84%
The fraud is when you refuse--
when the data tells you it's no

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.210 align:middle line:90%
longer working--

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you ignore it.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: You ignore it.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the fraud.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.749 align:middle line:84%
What you should do
then is say, all right.

00:23:21.749 --> 00:23:24.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to rewrite that model;
it's not working anymore.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.301 align:middle line:84%
And this is the problem
now in the climate field.

00:23:26.301 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to deal with
the failure of their models

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:84%
The IPC's has just issued
its most recent report.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And buried in that report are
good scientists' statements

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:84%
that our models aren't working,
the climate isn't warming.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:90%
We've got to deal with it.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But in the main
executive summary,

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
IPC says, we're
even more certain

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:84%
the climate is
warming right now.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
We're now 95% certain
the climate is warming.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Well that's fraud.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.770 align:middle line:84%
That's not looking at the data
and coming to conclusions.

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:84%
That's I decided what
the conclusion's going

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.680 align:middle line:84%
to be, and to hell
with the data.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
their bottom line?

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:84%
What do they get out of
convincing the planet

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:11.094 align:middle line:84%
but the climate is warming,
and it's being warmed by man.

00:24:11.094 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's
called fear mongering;

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:90%
it's called power play.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.489 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these people are
doing it for political reasons.

00:24:16.489 --> 00:24:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Not the scientists.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot
of the scientists

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:84%
who are playing this game
are working hand in glove

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:90%
with politicians.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Politicians now go
around fear mongering,

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
saying we're all going to
die from extreme weather

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.400 align:middle line:90%
and from global warming.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
must pass laws that

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.910 align:middle line:84%
are going to give us, the
politicians, more power.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's the bottom line.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Power.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the climate
change activity

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:84%
was to literally force
power, centralize power

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:90%
to government people.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.959 align:middle line:84%
And that's the other
part of the corruption.

00:24:49.959 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there big
money there for them?

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: There's big money,
but a lot of it's just power.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
politicians are

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.763 align:middle line:90%
interested in power and control.

00:24:56.763 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And if they can get laws passed
that say, you have to obey us,

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that we will tell
you how you can live

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:84%
your life in every
way, shape, and form,

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:84%
they get a little
kick out of that.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.530 align:middle line:84%
They like telling
people what to do.

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.196 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the politician, Bob,

00:25:11.196 --> 00:25:15.290 align:middle line:84%
who would come forward and say,
folks, we're in massive climate

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:20.170 align:middle line:84%
change, not caused by
man, this planet does it.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the historical graphs,

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:84%
you will find that we will
have extreme cold, extreme hot,

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:90%
droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:84%
You name it, this planet
is going to have it.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.260 align:middle line:90%
And it could affect your life.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Plan for it.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what would we do
with someone like that.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well, we
should vote them into power,

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.865 align:middle line:90%
is what we should do.

00:25:42.865 --> 00:25:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they're giving
us a reasonable-- humans

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.380 align:middle line:90%
are an adaptable species.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine joked, you
know, the sea is rising.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
In the '90s they said it was
rising 2 millimeters a year.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Now they say 3
millimeters a year,

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.350 align:middle line:84%
there's actually some
questions about the change

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.800 align:middle line:84%
there as well, there might
be fraud going on there.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.120 align:middle line:84%
But even at 3
millimeters a year,

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:08.782 align:middle line:84%
it will take a century for
the oceans to rise a foot.

00:26:08.782 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine once
joked, well you know,

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
stand on the beach

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
with the water lapping around
our knees, waiting to drown.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:90%
We'll do something about it.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not rising so fast
that we can't adapt.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, a good
politician shouldn't

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
be demagoguing the
issue right now.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:84%
They should be common sense,
thoughtfully, look the data.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Let the scientists tell
us what's happening.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And let's not try to push
politics and new laws

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
on the American citizenry
based on uncertain facts.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Any politician right
now that tells you

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that the science is
settled is a liar.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.100 align:middle line:90%
A fraudulent liar.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.430 align:middle line:84%
A politician doing that
is doing it for power.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:51.560 align:middle line:84%
From either party--
political party.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.710 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter which.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is a problem that we
as Americans have to recognize.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
The scientists themselves
within the community--

00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you another example.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.521 align:middle line:84%
There was a study
that came out, this

00:27:01.521 --> 00:27:04.265 align:middle line:84%
was where the 97% consensus
number comes from.

00:27:04.265 --> 00:27:06.350 align:middle line:84%
You know how many
scientists-- they

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:middle line:90%
interviewed 1,000 scientists.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.310 align:middle line:84%
They discovered that there
was-- the actual opinions

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:84%
of those 1,000 scientists
was like 50-50,

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.590 align:middle line:90%
it was very confused.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So what this study
did is, it picked out

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.720 align:middle line:84%
100 scientists that agreed
with global warming,

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and said 97% of those think
global warming is happening.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.084 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's why
there's a 97% consensus.

00:27:26.084 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:90%
The study was a fraud.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.810 align:middle line:84%
There have been other studies
that have looked at that fraud

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:90%
and said that's not true.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no consensus
in the science field.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.490 align:middle line:84%
If you talk to climate
scientists themselves,

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:34.890 align:middle line:84%
they're all-- the
good scientists

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.340 align:middle line:84%
will tell you repeatedly,
"We don't know yet enough

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.150 align:middle line:90%
to predict what's gonna happen."

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of them think,
yes, the theory of human

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.660 align:middle line:84%
caused global warming is a
concern and might be true.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.837 align:middle line:84%
Some of them will say
no, it isn't a concern.

00:27:47.837 --> 00:27:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But the good scientists
will say, well let's

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:84%
look at the data and
try to figure out

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.254 align:middle line:84%
which of those
theories is right.

00:27:52.254 --> 00:27:54.246 align:middle line:84%
The bad scientists
will say shut up.

00:27:54.246 --> 00:27:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, the
good scientists

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:59.645 align:middle line:84%
will clearly know this
has happened before.

00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Before there were industries,
before there were cars,

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.260 align:middle line:84%
we had high points
and low points.

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well now,
you see that, I'll

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.550 align:middle line:90%
play devil's advocate here.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the climate, we've
had medieval warm period.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.730 align:middle line:90%
We've had the little ice age.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:90%
These things happen.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:16.820 align:middle line:90%
There's no question of that.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And the climate fluctuates,
there's no question of that.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But a good scientist is
going to look at the data.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And the data says
that carbon dioxide

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.030 align:middle line:90%
is increasing in the atmosphere.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.200 align:middle line:90%
What is the consequence of that?

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But as a good scientist, we
should be trying to find out.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't be coming
to conclusions yet

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:36.810 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
know enough yet.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
the science really

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.880 align:middle line:84%
is: figuring out
the consequences.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.400 align:middle line:84%
The consequences
might be very small.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:84%
The data suggests that they're
inconsequential, to be honest.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wasn't the planet
more robust with higher carbon

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.566 align:middle line:84%
dioxide levels 100
million years ago?

00:28:55.566 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: There's an
interesting scientific fact

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.460 align:middle line:84%
that climate scientists,
especially global warming ones,

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:90%
don't want you to know.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And every climate
scientist knows this.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:84%
That they have good
proxy data that

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.580 align:middle line:84%
shows carbon dioxide
going up and down

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere over
millions of years.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, they
also have good proxy data

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that tells them the temperature
change is up and down.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
the temperature always

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.180 align:middle line:84%
precedes the change
in carbon dioxide.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So the temperature
gets warmer, and then

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:84%
the amount of carbon
dioxide increases.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
That suggests that carbon
dioxide is following it.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.560 align:middle line:84%
It isn't the cause of
temperature changes.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:84%
That's at least what
past data suggests.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:38.112 align:middle line:84%
So that would then tell
you, well then, maybe it's

00:29:38.112 --> 00:29:39.820 align:middle line:84%
not going to be such
a significant thing.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.908 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
about carbon dioxide

00:29:40.908 --> 00:29:42.200 align:middle line:90%
is it's a trace element.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.979 align:middle line:84%
The real global warming element
in the atmosphere is water.

00:29:45.979 --> 00:29:47.895 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we have
global warming right now.

00:29:47.895 --> 00:29:49.960 align:middle line:10%
It increases the temperature
by like 20 degrees.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:10%
If we didn't have water
in our atmosphere,

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.290 align:middle line:10%
this planet would
not be livable.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.130 align:middle line:10%
We actually have global
warming right now.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:56.055 align:middle line:10%
It's a good thing.

00:29:56.055 --> 00:29:57.055 align:middle line:10%
But it comes from water.

00:29:57.055 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:10%
Water is the main global
warming component.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dioxide is
a trace element.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.770 align:middle line:84%
It's such a small
component in the atmosphere

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.760 align:middle line:84%
that there's good
data to suggest

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:84%
it will never be
significant, possibly.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But, but, but, we are increasing
the amount in the atmosphere,

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.305 align:middle line:84%
and as good scientists
and human beings who

00:30:14.305 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle line:84%
want to be adaptable
and open minded,

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:19.230 align:middle line:84%
we've got to look at that and
see does it have a consequence?

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keep up the
good work, Robert.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:22.805 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Thank
you very much.

00:30:22.805 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Robert Zimmerman
on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.830 align:middle line:10%
A different perspective,
but one you need to know.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:90%
