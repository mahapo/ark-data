>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:90%
You know, the planet is alive.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.680 align:middle line:10%
It's the gaia theory.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a living,
breathing organism.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it needs to heal.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got the
expert who's going

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:90%
to tell us just how to do that.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Sarah Adams, a
multi-dimensional coach.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.258 align:middle line:84%
Sarah, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SARAH ADAMS: Thank you.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.528 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when we
talk about the planet,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to
heal, I've always

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
thought of it as a living,
breathing organism,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:90%
just like we are.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So the planet's an
ancient spirit that

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:90%
harbors many other spirits.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:10%
Some of those spirits come
from other dimensions,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:10%
other universes
and other places.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
These spirits,
you know, they all

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.690 align:middle line:84%
work in a symphony to
let life live upon it.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth, she's
an ancient spirit.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And some of the mountains
and the ocean, the ocean's

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
another spirit that
comes from another place,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:84%
so that these spirits all
came together to create

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:90%
this planet that we live on.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are all those
spirits good spirits or

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.525 align:middle line:10%
are some of them not?

00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: All of the
spirits are good spirits.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.110 align:middle line:84%
They're ancient spirits that
came together to create life

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and to allow life
to live upon them.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when
you got involved

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:84%
in doing this, what
happened to you in your life

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%
for you to do what
you're doing now

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:90%
as a multi-dimensional coach?

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So I was
born differently.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of memories of
the past and of a lot of things

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.305 align:middle line:90%
from other dimensions.

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Other lives?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Other
lives, yes, and also,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:84%
like I said, other
planets, which

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:90%
I've been very vocal about.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.153 align:middle line:84%
So I have this remembrance,
this knowledge that's within me.

00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That, a
lot of people do.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.150 align:middle line:84%
During hypnotherapy,
for example, we kind of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
pull out past lives
and things like that.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:84%
In your particular
case, you know this

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:90%
without having to be hypnotized.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen for you?

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.612 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, I have
a sort of contract

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that I would come to
Earth and that there

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
would be this time where
the planet and the elements

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:90%
were chaotic.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I would come to
Earth at that time

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and I would bring this
message to humanity

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
of how they have this inner
power, this divine force

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:84%
within them that they can use
and channel to heal this planet

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:90%
and heal the Earth.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you an
extraterrestrial, sort of?

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: That's a
very good question.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So I've taken many
different forms

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
on many different planets in
many different dimensions.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But above that, I am god
force, god source in a body,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:90%
and we all are.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:84%
We can take any
form that we want.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But above that, we are
the essence of the divine.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You definitely don't
look like an alien gray.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank God, right?

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.182 align:middle line:84%
But you could have
been one, right?

00:03:27.182 --> 00:03:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I can take
any form that I want.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll take, I
go inter-dimensionally.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'll take the form of a
wolf or the form of an eagle.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So I can go in the other
dimensions and take any form.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And if I want to incarnate in
my next lives in those forms,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:90%
I can do so, or as an ET.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you howl
during a full moon?

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No, no.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when we
talk about the planet

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and it needs to
heal sometimes, we

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
have gone through various stages
over the years of this planet

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:90%
being hurt by mankind.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:90%
How do you heal a planet?

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you do it with mass
consciousness, prayer,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.575 align:middle line:90%
what do you do to do that?

00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So to
heal a planet, you

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:90%
have to charge it with energy.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:90%
You have to fill it with energy.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And just like Reiki, we can
use energy to heal another.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:90%
The planet's the same way.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have the power to channel
energy through us, very, very

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:90%
powerful energy.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.700 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, there would
be this group of priests

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and priestesses and they
would direct the inhabitants

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:90%
of each planet to gather.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And the inhabitants
would then join together

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and they would join
in chant or in focus

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
in their force, this divine
force coming through them.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And they would focus it
to the core of the planet

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:84%
or they would focus it to
the oceans or to the skies.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And they would use that
energy to heal or to bring up

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.722 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of the
planet that they lived on.

00:04:58.722 --> 00:05:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at the universe

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:90%
as a whole for a moment.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion, has
it always been this way

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:84%
or is there something else to
it in terms of its complexity?

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: No, it hasn't
been like this always.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:84%
From my memories, there, all
the planets were inhabited.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.652 align:middle line:84%
There was inter-dimensional
travel among each planet.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In our solar system?

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:90%
So Venus, Mars, Saturn.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Saturn was the original
sun that I remember.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And so there was not
only were they traveling

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
among the planets,
they were also

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:90%
traveling inter-dimensionally.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So they would get
out of their bodies

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and they would interact with
inter-dimensional beings.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
There was this
great civilization

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
that existed that you might
term as the Garden of Eden.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria, Atlantis, there were
many different names for this.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And we think that it was just
an island or it was this,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis was an island.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:84%
When actually, it was the
whole interplanetary system

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:90%
that was connected.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:90%
And all the planets were tuned.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to tune each planet.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.560 align:middle line:84%
All the planets were tuned
to higher frequencies.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
When they were in
higher frequencies,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:90%
the planets were more fertile.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
People would live for
hundreds of years.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
The inhabitants on
them would not age.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:90%
They would be healthy.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:84%
There was no
sickness, no disease.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
We have fallen from
those frequencies.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:90%
We have fallen from that.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So no, that this
entire system, universe

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.583 align:middle line:90%
was not like this before.

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something dramatic
happened, because as you say,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
there's no more inhabitants
on Mars or Venus

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:90%
or Saturn or anything else.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:90%
What happened to change that?

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So from my
memories, I remember

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:84%
that there was this group
of priests and priestesses

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.070 align:middle line:84%
that would travel
from planet to planet.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: They would
direct inhabitants,

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
like I said, to channel energies
and keep the frequencies

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:90%
of each planet high.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:84%
But they would also create new
contracts with new dimensions.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Just like we have astronauts
that we send to space,

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:84%
they would do exploration of new
dimensions in other dimensions.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And they would open them up.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.925 align:middle line:84%
So we had remote viewers that
would look behind the dimension

00:07:15.925 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and they would
say, OK, we should

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:84%
open this, a gateway or a
portal to this dimension

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and create a treaty
with this new dimension

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and the inhabitants,
because they

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:90%
were very multi-dimensional.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And they opened up the,
they opened up a gate

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:90%
to a force that got out.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's the force
that absorbs energy.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when they opened up this
gate, this force came through,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and they could not
master that force.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:90%
This group, they were masters.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:90%
They could master forces.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:90%
They were master geneticists.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it a mistake
to open up the gate?

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the ones
on that planet, this

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:84%
happened on Mars,
by the way, this

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:84%
is where we have
the whole, the Ares,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:90%
and that the god of war, Mars.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Is because
that's where,

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.715 align:middle line:84%
that is where war originated
when this force came through

00:08:08.715 --> 00:08:09.515 align:middle line:90%
on that planet.

00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So this force came
through, and they could not,

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.560 align:middle line:84%
this group of priests
and priestesses

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
could not master this force.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.785 align:middle line:84%
And it's the force
that absorbs energy.

00:08:20.785 --> 00:08:22.160 align:middle line:84%
So it came through
and it started

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:84%
to absorb the energy from
Mars, from the inhabitants

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.980 align:middle line:90%
that made them in chaos.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:84%
It literally put everybody
fighting among each other.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
die off, Sarah?

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: They were ended
up having a nuclear war.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, jeez.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: On Mars.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
remnants of this.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So this force got out and it
took over some of those priests

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and priestesses.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:84%
There are many priests
and priestesses

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:84%
that were clear of this force,
that didn't, have weren't

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
infiltrated by it,
went to Saturn,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and this force went for Saturn,
which was the original sun.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
It absorbed the
energy from Saturn.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
The group of priests and
priestesses that remained,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:84%
took whatever light
was left and created

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
our sun we have now
and with it, to keep

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:84%
the light in this universe,
so that we could eventually

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.810 align:middle line:84%
channel it to push this force
back and save our, this planet,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and save all life
in the 3D realms.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We did seem to luck out
during all of this, because we

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:84%
did seem to be the beneficiary
of all the tragedy that

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.510 align:middle line:90%
happened in the solar system.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Well, that's because
Earth was a new planet.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:33.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a planet that had,
it was, there wasn't life

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't meant to
live on at that time.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:84%
It was, they used
it for genetics,

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:84%
they used it to
create new plant life,

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
they used it to create
new forms of technology

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to energy.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So it was like on
a computer that you

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:90%
would have your backup drive.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.060 align:middle line:90%
It was not meant to live on.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So when all of the, when
all the chaos happened

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:84%
among the planets and this
force went from each planet

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.100 align:middle line:84%
to each planet absorbing the
core energy of each planet,

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
it absorbed the
energy fields, Earth

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.180 align:middle line:84%
was the remaining planet with
a very strong shield around it.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
were the bodies

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:84%
that they had
created, because there

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of genetic, a lot of
genetic sort of experimentation

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.510 align:middle line:90%
that was going on.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And they all came from the
other planets and onto Earth,

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.430 align:middle line:84%
onto this planet, until
they could find a solution

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.870 align:middle line:90%
to push this force back.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I find it remarkable
that Cairo means Mars.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's some kind
of tie-in with Egypt.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:84%
In our program,
"The Pyramid Code,"

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:84%
they discuss Egypt's
tie-in to the stars.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.062 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:42.062 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Why were the
ancients so interested

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.280 align:middle line:10%
in the motion of the stars?

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.380 align:middle line:10%
Why was cosmology
sacred to the ancients?

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:10%


00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:10%
Pondering the history
of ancient Egypt,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:10%
we typically think of the
mysteries of the pyramids

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:10%
and the grandeur of the temples.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:10%
But where does it all start?

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:10%
Do we know how long
ago the ancients

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:10%
began tracking the stars?

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:10%
Could there be lost worlds
buried beneath the sands?

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarah, what is
Egypt's tie-in to this?

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So Egypt's part
of an ancient system.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And if, you know, there's been
a lot of research into this.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:90%
We have the Cydonia.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:90%
We have the face on Mars.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we have, of course,
the Stonehenge on this planet.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:84%
This is part of that ancient
system that is actually

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:90%
activated via energy.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.792 align:middle line:84%
All the hieroglyphs,
they're like magic sigils.

00:11:51.792 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And when energy's
channeled through there

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:90%
that activates them.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a computer system.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just turns
them right on.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It's an
energetic computer system.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But it flowed through all of the
different energetic monuments

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
This is when we had the
inter-dimensional system that

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:90%
connected all planets.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
They would use this system
that channeled energy.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:90%
They would use it to regenerate.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:90%
They would use it to teleport.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:84%
The Stonehenge could teleport
large groups of people

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:90%
onto other planets.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Into other dimensions.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's part of that
ancient system that still

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:90%
exists on this planet today.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's pyramids, temples,
and many other monuments

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.418 align:middle line:84%
similar to this on other
planets, and even on moons.

00:12:36.418 --> 00:12:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going
to say, is Egypt

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.940 align:middle line:84%
representative of other things
throughout the solar system?

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Very, very much, it's
part of that system,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:90%
that ancient system.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:90%
It's the remnants of it.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people have
said that the pyramids are

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:90%
a power plant.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:84%
I think it could also be
used for energy and healing.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So what I remember, is that the
pyramids didn't originate here.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:90%
They were brought here.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And they can actually
take an energetic form.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.770 align:middle line:84%
You see them solid, but they
can take an energetic form.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And they were put here to
channel energy directly

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:90%
into the middle of the Earth.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Originally, they were
a temple in a way,

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:84%
because people
would gather around

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and they would direct energy
and they would direct the energy

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:84%
directly into the
middle of the Earth,

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
tune the planet.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.750 align:middle line:90%
But also.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But would the
pyramids also direct energy

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.240 align:middle line:90%
to the people?

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So it would direct energy
to the entire planet,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:84%
to all the inhabitants, to
all life on this planet,

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:90%
and the core of the planet.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But it was also used
for something else.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What?

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.427 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: This is the secret.

00:13:41.427 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:90%
See, each planet is, say Venus.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Venus affects our heart chakra.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the planet of love.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Saturn affects the,
Saturn casts our reality

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:90%
that we live in right now.

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:90%
It also casts this time.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:90%
So Saturn projects realities.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.295 align:middle line:84%
So they could gather around
the pyramid and they could.

00:14:01.295 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Also, were
a perceived energy

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.625 align:middle line:84%
to come into the core of the
Earth and charge the planet

00:14:08.625 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and bring the frequency up,
they could also send energy out.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.203 align:middle line:84%
So to create the realities that
they wanted, they would use it.

00:14:17.203 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:84%
They would gather around and
they would channel the energy

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and they would send
these messages,

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:84%
like this energy, this light
energy directly to Saturn.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn, so that
they could, they

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
can make the realities
that they wanted.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
know how to do this?

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So you can,
you can tune planets.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is ancient knowledge.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:84%
This comes from before
the fall of that system,

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.060 align:middle line:90%
of the interplanetary system.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Each planet would
be tuned just so

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
that everything is was in
synchronicity in a symphony.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.493 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it all functioned.

00:14:50.493 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It all
functioned in such

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:56.075 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful glorious symphony.

00:14:56.075 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
something went wrong.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:90%
That portal was opened.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:90%
And I want to really say this.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
With Saturn, so we have
chaotic timelines right now

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:10%
And with Saturn, we can
direct our energy to Saturn

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:10%
to protect the
realities that we want.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to bring
more heart chakra opening

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
onto this planet, we
can sit multitudes

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and focus on channeling
energy to Venus, which

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.120 align:middle line:84%
will reflect back like a
mirror and reflect that back

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.010 align:middle line:84%
on the heart chakras
on this planet,

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.627 align:middle line:84%
of every person's heart chakra
and open up their heart chakra.

00:15:29.627 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do
that in meditation?

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Yes, this
is the work that I've

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.760 align:middle line:90%
been working on a lot right.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.843 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long do you
have to meditate in order

00:15:35.843 --> 00:15:37.542 align:middle line:90%
to get into that mode?

00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Me, I sometimes
sit and meditate

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:90%
for up to eight hours a day.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eight hours a day?

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Sometimes, yes.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without interruption?

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you go to a certain
room or something like that?

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: There's an
orb right on top there.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes I'll
lay on the ground.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.005 align:middle line:90%
That's another thing.

00:15:56.005 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll just lay flat on the ground
and meditate on the ground too.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.380 align:middle line:90%
So I really love it.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
several chakras anyways?

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Give us a definition.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So a
chakra is an energy.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.813 align:middle line:84%
A chakra is a specific
energy point in the body.

00:16:15.813 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're all
over the body, aren't they?

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And each chakra is
aligned to each planet.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And each planet
and each chakra is

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:84%
aligned to a gland or a
specific part of the body,

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:90%
of the physical body.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that why
acupuncture sometimes

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.650 align:middle line:90%
deals with chakra points too?

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's about
channeling those energies.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And when those are cleared,
then you can channel in.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:84%
On this Earth, we
function at 20%

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.220 align:middle line:84%
of who we can truly
function at, of what

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:90%
we can truly function at.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're functioning at this
much of what we can function.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The chakras within your
body, can they ever be damaged?

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:90%
They can be depleted.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So this is the
problem, is that a lot of people

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:90%
are depleted energetically.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So since they're
depleted energetically,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
they're functioning
at a lower frequency

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.832 align:middle line:84%
than they should
be functioning at.

00:17:15.832 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What planets are
aligned with our own chakra

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:90%
system?

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:90%
All of them?

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, all of them.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we really need
to get back in touch with this.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.497 align:middle line:84%
And we need to understand
that when we sit there

00:17:28.497 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and we meditate and
we gather together

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and we channel energy through
us, we can, like I said,

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.300 align:middle line:84%
we can channel it to
a specific planet,

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and that will mirror it back
and open up this specific chakra

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.873 align:middle line:90%
that we're focusing on.

00:17:39.873 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After an
eight hour meditation,

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:90%
how do you feel after that?

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I always feel
quite good all the time.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Regenerated?

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not exhausted.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how often
do you have to do that?

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: At this point
right now, I've finished,

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I've been instructed to
do a lot of inner work,

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:90%
so that's what I'm focusing on.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you do
it, you do this a lot.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:04.673 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:18:04.673 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a program
called "Open Minds" with Regina

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.798 align:middle line:84%
Meredith, and she
interviewed the author,

00:18:08.798 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:84%
an intuitive healer, Cyndi
Dale, about different groupings

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:90%
of chakras.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:10%
>>CYNDI DALE: This is
what's cool about chakras.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they go all the
way down through our body

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:10%
into the Earth.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:10%
They're around us, and
they go on top of us.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:10%
The energy centers more
on the top part of us

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.010 align:middle line:10%
are more spiritual,
so they're sort of

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:10%
like what would we like.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:10%
The ones in the middle of the
body are more psychological.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:10%
So they're like, what
are we ready to receive?

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.860 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we can say we
want a relationship.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.950 align:middle line:10%
Have we worked
through the issues?

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:10%
Have we worked through
our childhood traumas?

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.185 align:middle line:10%
Do we really want
somebody living with us?

00:18:44.185 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:10%
Which I would say
at this moment,

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:10%
no, for me, but you sort
of have to be honest.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Right

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.385 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Dogs are OK, not sure
about the rest of it yet.

00:18:52.385 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: You know?

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:10%
And then the really physical,
dense energy centers

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:10%
are kind of in the, hips
area and on the way down.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:10%
So if you really want
to receive something,

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle line:10%
and we are receiving
something all the time.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: So what we
want is showing up.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.170 align:middle line:10%
But if we want to kind
of alter the path,

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:10%
you also have to alter what
messages you're sending out

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:10%
and what you're
willing to receive

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:10%
to make a physical
change, to receive

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:10%
something solid and real,
in those lower chakras.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.330 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Right.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.247 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: So a lot of times
people do a picture.

00:19:23.247 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:10%
But that's up here.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.435 align:middle line:10%
You've gotta feel it.

00:19:25.435 --> 00:19:26.268 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:19:26.268 --> 00:19:28.127 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Or generate
it in the body also.

00:19:28.127 --> 00:19:28.960 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Exactly.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:10%
And another much maligned word
is, certainly in Buddhism,

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.870 align:middle line:10%
is desire.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:33.670 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: The
reality is, there

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:10%
is nothing in the universe
that exists without desire.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:10%
There was a desired outcome.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Yeah.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.830 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: By
something or someone.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Right.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Right?

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:44.830 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Right.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: And so the use
of desire in the proper way,

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.440 align:middle line:10%
to create this ultimate
outcome you'd like to see,

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:10%
and then the feeling
that desire fuels.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.030 align:middle line:10%
Like, that would feel so good.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.645 align:middle line:10%
I'd be so satisfied with that.

00:19:58.645 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:10%
That's what you're
talking about.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Yes.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.310 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: That's
where it has to.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: That's the word.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Feel and
flow through the body.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:04.930 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: Yes, because it's full.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: And so it's going to
be physical, emotional, mental,

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.877 align:middle line:10%
you know, all those
things that we

00:20:08.877 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:10%
have to return to the basics.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:11.780 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: It's all those levels.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, she seems
to be into chakras too.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Is she pretty accurate?

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But I, my, it's my knowledge
that society functions

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
on mostly the lower chakras
without accessing the higher

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:90%
chakras.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what are lower
chakras as opposed to higher?

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:90%
You mean in position?

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're not accessing the
heart chakra and the crown

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:90%
chakra like they should.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:90%
And this is a problem.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have such a
lack of empathy and compassion

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:90%
in society, is because of this.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.870 align:middle line:84%
The lower chakras
are, they're very much

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
connected more to the 3D world
Whereas the higher chakras are

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
connected to higher
consciousness.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spiritual.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And, yes, and
to the supernatural.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
concentrate on healing,

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
do you concentrate
on chakra points?

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I do, yes.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I concentrate on that
connected to the aura.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of, as stated, a
lot of people's chakra systems

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.323 align:middle line:90%
are depleted.

00:21:11.323 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And because they're
depleted, this

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.200 align:middle line:84%
is causing a lot of
emotional trauma,

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:90%
a lot of physical issues.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And once we heal those,
that has an effect

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
on their physical bodies
and on their thoughts,

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and just their
well-being in general.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What depletes
those chakras, Sarah?

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: We can lose
energy all the time.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And we do lose
energy all the time,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:90%
if we're not watching out.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anxiety, depression.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's all
contributes to it?

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Even past, trauma
from past lives.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Trauma in life, having
a stressful job,

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
having any trauma as a
child, bad relationships,

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:84%
That all depletes our
energy field of our aura

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:90%
and of our chakra system.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
tell if a planet

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
is contributing to your
chakras positive or negative?

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that there are
specific, as stated, there

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:84%
are specific planets that are,
well, the planets are aligned

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:90%
to specific chakras within us.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe that
right now, everything

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:90%
is a bit chaotic.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And we are not,
everything is in chaos.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:90%
And we need to.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
always in chaos.

00:22:20.355 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Yes, but we
need to find some order.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It's time for us
to find some order,

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:84%
because the elements on this
planet, this planet's energy

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.500 align:middle line:90%
field is in chaos.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Humanity's in chaos.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's time that we
return to our divine self,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to our inner God, to our inner
Christ, to our inner Savior,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and channel that power, and
channel that to heal and bring

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.150 align:middle line:90%
everything into order.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.772 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens
if we don't do that?

00:22:47.772 --> 00:22:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Or if we can't do that?

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: More chaos.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we get
sicker as people?

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Most of society is
sick on an emotional level,

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
on a physical level, on many
different levels already.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a nice
little quote code.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm into codes
and symbolism,

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and I have a lot of respect
for Jordan Maxwell, by the way.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.780 align:middle line:90%
He does a lot of work on that.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bible, it talks
about the four horsemen.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:84%
The four horsemen are
the four elements.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And the four horsemen,
it says in the end days,

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:84%
actually I like to call them
the days of the wakening

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:84%
or the time of the
wakening, will be in chaos.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:84%
They'll, and the way
to get those four

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.600 align:middle line:84%
elements under control, is
to come from the God force

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.400 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we do this
to ourselves though?

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: We do.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We put our own
chaos and we do this.

00:23:40.765 --> 00:23:41.565 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: We do.

00:23:41.565 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:84%
By not acknowledging our soul,
not acknowledging energy,

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:90%
we put ourselves in chaos.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have the
power to change our lives?

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: We have the
power to change our lives

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
and to heal this planet, and
also to become very, very

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:90%
powerful.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How powerful?

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: As powerful
as God itself.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it's put
in the right hands.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:84%
What if it's put
in the wrong hands?

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Can that power be put in the
wrong hands on this planet?

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: The divine would
never allow its power.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:90%
It's wise beyond time.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:84%
It would never allow its power
to fall into the wrong hands.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:84%
We can only achieve
that power within us

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.920 align:middle line:84%
once we build ourselves
up to compassion

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.240 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves and others.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Through empathy,
through kindness.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:84%
We have to pass these
different gateways

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.960 align:middle line:90%
to access that power within us.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Once we prove that we
are honorable enough

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and that we are, we
deserve that power,

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:84%
then that power
channels through us.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And when we channel that
force through us, the divine,

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.090 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to label it.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:58.820 align:middle line:84%
God has been called, you know,
God and religion is not God.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.920 align:middle line:84%
God is a force that
flows through us.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
We, you and me are alive
here, because this force

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.150 align:middle line:90%
that flows through us.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we go through
these different tests

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and we access that God, we're
allowed to access that God

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:84%
power and then we can tell
the elements what to do,

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:90%
we can tell the oceans to heal.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.565 align:middle line:84%
We can tell the skies to
become clear again and heal

00:25:19.565 --> 00:25:20.780 align:middle line:90%
of the pollution.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:84%
We have power over the
elements, because God

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:90%
has power over the elements.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:90%
We are part of God.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.185 align:middle line:90%
We are God in a physical body.

00:25:27.185 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
recommend, Sarah, people

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:84%
do when they wake up,
ready to start their day?

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
They might not have
time to meditate.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:84%
They surely can't do
it for eight hours.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But what do they do to
have to tune themselves up?

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You know, it
takes a couple of minutes.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.310 align:middle line:90%
You can do a bubble.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.425 align:middle line:84%
Visualize taking out all
your pain, your stress.

00:25:45.425 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.325 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Your anger.

00:25:46.325 --> 00:25:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smart.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Your negative
emotions, your negative energies

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:52.472 align:middle line:84%
out of your aura, your
organs, your cells.

00:25:52.472 --> 00:25:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before
you start your day.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.980 align:middle line:90%
I just, I just visualize this.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.688 align:middle line:84%
And quickly, you put
it into that bubble,

00:25:57.688 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:84%
visualize that bubble
floating off into the sun,

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.500 align:middle line:90%
burning into nothing.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I visualize this
golden light coming into me.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Then I visualize each color
of the rainbow pouring

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:90%
into my organs and into my body.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
That right there,
starts to connect you.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And the more and more that
you can connect to your energy

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.450 align:middle line:84%
field, the more that it
starts to relay messages back

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:90%
to you via dreams.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Via visions, via
synchronicities, via symbolism.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
this just knowing.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And as you connect
more and more and more,

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:84%
you step into this
God power within you,

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and you understand that
you are one of the,

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:37.940 align:middle line:84%
you are your own Christ, and you
play a big role on this planet.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are some people
more tuned in than others?

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Like you, you're probably more
tuned in than somebody else.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.548 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You know, a
while ago, you said to me,

00:26:47.548 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:84%
you said, are you an
alien, are you this?

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that every
person on this planet

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.253 align:middle line:84%
has had lives in
other dimensions.

00:26:56.253 --> 00:26:57.170 align:middle line:90%
They have been aliens.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: They have been animals.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: They come
from other planets.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just don't
want to be a mosquito.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.588 align:middle line:84%
Please tell me I'm
not a mosquito.

00:27:06.588 --> 00:27:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: You're not a mosquito.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And they
have forgotten this.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.660 align:middle line:84%
When they incarnated in bodies,
they have forgotten this.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I just, I do the work to
bring that energy into myself

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.553 align:middle line:90%
and to channel it.

00:27:20.553 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And because I do it, I'm allowed
to have this information.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:84%
But anybody on this planet
can access that information.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's my
message to humanity.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:90%
To say, you are powerful.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:84%
You can tune the planets so
that they project realities back

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.440 align:middle line:90%
that are positive and healing.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
You can tune your elite
leaders and send them

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:84%
so that they reflect back
empathy and compassion.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:90%
We can, humanity has the power.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:90%
This is my message.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And as much as
people say, oh, you

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:84%
can heal, Sarah, you can
do this, I say to them,

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.610 align:middle line:90%
you can do as much, if not more.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is my message
from the divine.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
That they awaken to
that power within them,

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.225 align:middle line:84%
and they use that
to heal themselves

00:28:00.225 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:90%
and to save this planet.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we winning,
Sarah, this battle?

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.370 align:middle line:90%
This battle of self-healing?

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: There is a
great awakening going on.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
about five years ago,

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.240 align:middle line:84%
people didn't even
eat organic food.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Now there's Whole Foods in.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
talking about it.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:18.672 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stuff like that.

00:28:18.672 --> 00:28:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So there's an
awakening also to health.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's an awakening, I
just noticed on media, there's

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.560 align:middle line:84%
such an awakening
going on when it

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.340 align:middle line:90%
comes to information like this.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.307 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So we are going
through an awakening, which

00:28:30.307 --> 00:28:31.470 align:middle line:90%
is a very positive sign.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.330 align:middle line:84%
I can't promise
there won't be chaos.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I feel that, you know, a diamond
is only made under pressure.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And humanity, they're only
going to truly wake up

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:90%
when things go wrong.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.400 align:middle line:84%
When things are chaotic, when
they no longer, you know,

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:90%
because they're so busy.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.950 align:middle line:84%
They go to their
everyday lives and they

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.117 align:middle line:90%
don't sit there and reflect.

00:28:51.117 --> 00:28:53.273 align:middle line:84%
They don't sit there
and tap into themselves.

00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the divine wants.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's going, they're going
to have more and more pressure

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.560 align:middle line:90%
until they do so.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're human
beings, so we're going

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.530 align:middle line:90%
to have ups and downs in life.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.970 align:middle line:84%
How do we cope with that in
order to stay in this mode

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.490 align:middle line:84%
that you've been talking
about on the program?

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: We become masters
rather than becoming,

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.550 align:middle line:90%
rather than being co-pilots.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And most people on this
planet, the majority of people

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:90%
on this planet are co-pilots.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:19.960 align:middle line:90%
So when we want.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I want to be a pilot.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: When we do exercises
like I said a while ago,

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, we start to become
in control of our energy field.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And then as we do, that
relays back to us messages,

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and we become one with our
soul, one with our energy field,

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:90%
one with the divine within us.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.735 align:middle line:84%
And then we can cope much
more with everyday life.

00:29:41.735 --> 00:29:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in
the power of intention, Sarah?

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I do.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But you can think something for
days and for hours and forever,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:84%
for years, and it's
not going to happen

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.940 align:middle line:84%
unless you have the charge
of energy within your body.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you just sit there
and think something,

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:90%
it won't happen.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you connect
to that energy field

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:84%
within you, your
soul, and you think,

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.280 align:middle line:84%
then you're connecting the
energy to the thought form,

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.197 align:middle line:90%
and you can create it.

00:30:07.197 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that like prayer?

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Does prayer work?

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES]

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Prayer does work.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:90%
I pray, I meditate.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You hesitated.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Because I
feel that meditation is

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.487 align:middle line:90%
much more powerful than prayer.

00:30:20.487 --> 00:30:21.695 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Than prayer, really?

00:30:21.695 --> 00:30:22.495 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:30:22.495 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:90%
I often pray for the planet.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I get down on my
knees and I sit there

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.718 align:middle line:90%
and I pray for the planet.

00:30:27.718 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you do, are
you going to a higher source?

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I visualize my
heart chakra opening,

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and I say listen, to the divine
I say, look at this planet.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
They're have, you know,
they're having a hard time

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
through things.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And just help me to channel
out that energy into them

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.510 align:middle line:84%
to do what I can to
be a portal of light.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the one as important
and as powerful as the many?

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: What is the one?

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, could we
have, will one Sarah Adams

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:02.110 align:middle line:84%
be able to clean and heal
the planet as opposed

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:90%
to 1,000 of them?

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: See, this
is for me, this

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:84%
is something that
somewhat bothers me.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I sit here and I
give these messages, right,

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people
to focus on me.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I want them to
focus on themselves

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:90%
and how powerful they are.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody
focuses on aliens

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and inter-dimensional
beings, which is great.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
these beings, these ETs,

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.430 align:middle line:84%
all the hosts of the
heavens and realms

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.825 align:middle line:84%
want humanity to waken to
their power and use that power.

00:31:36.825 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
us to succeed?

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, they do.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And they can't
completely step in.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if they stepped in
and they saved this planet,

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:46.270 align:middle line:84%
people would just
expect every time

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.040 align:middle line:84%
to be saved rather than
finding their own power.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So they step into a
certain, they step in

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.400 align:middle line:84%
on a certain level, but
they're not going entirely

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.035 align:middle line:90%
step in and save the planet.

00:31:56.035 --> 00:31:59.230 align:middle line:84%
It's for us on this planet
to rise into our power

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and to our God selves and
to completely save it.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not for them.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have been as
a planet, through a lot.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:15.260 align:middle line:84%
How difficult is it to sometimes
push that aside and concentrate

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:19.490 align:middle line:84%
on the goodness and healing
when you're bombarded

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:90%
with all this negativity?

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I have had some
hard times in my life.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I did, is rather
than letting those memories

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and that energy
control me, I went in

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.420 align:middle line:90%
and I cleared those memories.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.860 align:middle line:90%
And I also cleared that energy.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.500 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't affect
me on any level.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of karmic
energy around this planet that

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:90%
needs to be cleared.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:45.060 align:middle line:84%
We need to awaken more
to our inner power,

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and then channel clearing that
karmic layer off this planet.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:53.700 align:middle line:84%
As we do, when we
clear those energies,

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.297 align:middle line:84%
we won't even think
about those bad times.

00:32:56.297 --> 00:32:58.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't think about any
of the bad times I've had.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're not
a negative person.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:00.510 align:middle line:90%
You don't come across as one.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm very positive, actually.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I think, and I had
a lot of hardship,

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.090 align:middle line:84%
but I always think
about the good times.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I never go back to those
negative times whatsoever.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.800 align:middle line:90%
So we can do the same.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.890 align:middle line:84%
We can clear, by
clearing out that energy,

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:84%
we can clear out that
trauma and we will not

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:21.980 align:middle line:90%
be pulled back to it.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.250 align:middle line:84%
The reason we're pulled back
to negative times in life

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:26.208 align:middle line:84%
or to negative things,
is because there's still

00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:28.750 align:middle line:84%
energy there that lingers
that needs to be cleared.

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do final
sessions for people?

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I do.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I work with people
all around the world.

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do it via phone,
Skype, how does that work?

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.060 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I do it
on Skype, phone,

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.530 align:middle line:10%
many different, many
different ways, you might say.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm able to work on
somebody all across the world.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't even need to speak
to them on the phone.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So I have clients that
come to me, they're like,

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.825 align:middle line:84%
can you work on this
person, and I do so

00:33:53.825 --> 00:33:55.450 align:middle line:84%
without even speaking
to them at times.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.992 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
your website, Sarah?

00:33:56.992 --> 00:33:59.215 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: www.sarahradams.com.

00:33:59.215 --> 00:34:00.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: sarahradams.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:00.365 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: .com

00:34:00.365 --> 00:34:00.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: .com

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.440 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.523 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK, you got to
put the R in there, right?

00:34:03.523 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.055 align:middle line:84%
Since you've been doing
this, which has been,

00:34:07.055 --> 00:34:09.383 align:middle line:90%
how many years now?

00:34:09.383 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I think I've really
delved into it the last

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.552 align:middle line:90%
like five years.

00:34:12.552 --> 00:34:14.219 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Really poured
yourself into it?

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: To working
with the public, yes.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you noticed
a change with people

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.100 align:middle line:90%
or with this planet?

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Is it getting better or worse?

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You know, there's a
change, but words are words.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.770 align:middle line:90%
We need to hold the vibration.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And for me, even sitting here
doing this interview with you

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.949 align:middle line:84%
that many people
are going to watch,

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:42.429 align:middle line:84%
and that is not as important
as me holding the vibration,

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:90%
the frequency within me.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:47.560 align:middle line:84%
We can all work at
changing this planet

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:84%
just by holding that frequency
without saying a word.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keep us
together, Sarah.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.159 align:middle line:84%
It's a big
responsibility, isn't it?

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.720 align:middle line:90%


00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: For humanity, it is.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will you do it?

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: They have, they
have to find themselves.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarah, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Thank you.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's heal the planet,
collectively, individually,

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.090 align:middle line:10%
but keep doing it.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Because you know what?

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.700 align:middle line:90%
It'll pay off in the long run.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, thanks for
watching "Beyond Belief."
