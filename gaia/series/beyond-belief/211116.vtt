00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:10%
Von Braschler with us,
a former faculty member

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.130 align:middle line:10%
at the Omega Institute
for Holistic Studies,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:10%
a lifetime member of the
Theosophical Society,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.320 align:middle line:10%
and the author of several
books on consciousness and time

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:10%
travel.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.453 align:middle line:90%
Von, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:34.453 --> 00:00:35.912 align:middle line:84%
>>VON BRASCHLER:
Thank you, George.

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:38.598 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your favorite,
consciousness or time travel?

00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: At this
point, honestly,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.370 align:middle line:90%
I can't see the difference.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And you throw dreaming in there,
I can't see the difference.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle line:84%
It's all an exercise
in human consciousness

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.253 align:middle line:84%
and relating to the
universal consciousness.

00:00:51.253 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you an
Albert Einstein fan?

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.878 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Yes, I am.

00:00:53.878 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
time mean to you?

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Time to me is
opportunity, a opportunity.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:10%
And I think that it
is our obligation

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:10%
to go around and around and
around this big carousel

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:10%
we call time, the time loop.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.700 align:middle line:10%
And every one of
us goes around it

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:10%
and we call this our lifetime.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we go around it
and we call it our lifetime.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we get on
again and go around it.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the "Wizard
of Oz," but it never ends.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:84%
You keep going home and
you keep going to Oz.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think that a time is
infinite, it's elastic,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's everlasting.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's a loop
that all of us need

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
to explore, not just here
and now, but everywhere.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.923 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is time
travel possible?

00:01:40.923 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: It is possible.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not only possible,
but it's done all the time

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
by people who are really
skilled in various techniques

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.370 align:middle line:84%
to achieve controlled
time shifts.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
have time travel,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.497 align:middle line:84%
are you going forward
or backward in time?

00:01:58.497 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Now,
this is interesting.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I have to lean on
Professor Einstein.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.710 align:middle line:90%
We tend to go back.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason
is most of us simply

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
can't relate to or believe
in the concept of ourselves

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:84%
going forward, or maybe
there's a fear of the unknown.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.350 align:middle line:90%
But mostly, we go back.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:90%
We mostly go back in time.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Einstein, when he
talked about time travel

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
in his relativity
theory, he talked

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
about going back in
time by achieving

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.990 align:middle line:84%
the speed of light, which is
a billion miles per second.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:90%
It's just a phenomenal speed.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a universal speed
that would be attainable,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:90%
but not physically attainable.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It would be attainable
somehow, magically.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.610 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, maybe
through-- he said maybe

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:90%
through a black hole.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:90%
We call it singularity.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:84%
If you could achieve the speed
of light, you could, he said,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:90%
then go back in time.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:84%
He did not address the theory
of going forward in time.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:90%
But we know that people do.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By seconds?

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:90%
How long?

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Well,
years in advance.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:90%
We have examples.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I've studied in research
and I've interviewed.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
There are examples of people
that have gone forward in time.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they come back
and sometimes they don't.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.170 align:middle line:10%
But Rudolf Fentz,
it's a famous case.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:10%
It was printed in Collier's.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he went forward in time
decades and never returned.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean never returned?

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.527 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: He was struck--

00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
he was struck by a car
and never returned.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.145 align:middle line:84%
And his body, it was then into
the future several decades.

00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that
the guy who showed up

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.910 align:middle line:90%
in Manhattan or something?

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.952 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Yes, indeed.

00:03:41.952 --> 00:03:42.810 align:middle line:90%
He was the man.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.268 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't have
a lot of examples

00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
of people that go forward
physically in time

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.995 align:middle line:84%
to the degree that
they interact.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But usually you go there
and you're a witness,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and people don't see you
or nothing seems to move.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes there's a
complete physical case

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.088 align:middle line:90%
of going forward in time.

00:04:04.088 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
there's the case

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
of prophetic dreaming,
where people go forward

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:90%
in their very lucid dreams.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And they have these dreams of
prophecy and they come true.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And how could they know this?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they've
gone forward in time.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then back
again with a memory or--

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.828 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: With
the memory of it.

00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:26.713 align:middle line:84%
Just like the shaman, they go
back with the memory of it.

00:04:26.713 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a difference
between what we would

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:90%
consider time and God's time?

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Yes.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.517 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:04:33.517 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: So I always
like to quote Leibniz,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:84%
the German rational philosopher,
mathematician, I think,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:84%
of the 18th century,
Gottfried Leibniz.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said that there's God's
time and there's man's time.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
God's time is
infinite, it's fluid.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.580 align:middle line:90%
You can't account for it.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:90%
It's flexible.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Man's time is very controlled
and limited, and fixed.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
We have this boxed in,
fixed in linear approach.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.950 align:middle line:84%
This three-dimensional
view of time space,

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:90%
or space time as Einstein said.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So there's man's time
and there's God's time.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And Leibniz says, well,
he said don't fret.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.330 align:middle line:90%
It's just sooner or later.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is time travel
physical or mental?

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Yes and yes.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I've written-- this is
my third book on time.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And early on, I thought all
the examples of successful time

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.840 align:middle line:84%
shifting I've seen
have been by people

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
who would go into
meditation or deep trances,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:90%
like mystics or shamans.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And they would go as a witness.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to me
that they were traveling

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:90%
in time in an energy body.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And I think this is very common.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:90%
I think it's very common.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's more than
just astral travel,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
it's actually all your
energy body is leaving.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness, of
course, is intelligent energy

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:84%
that occupies all
your subtle bodies.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:90%
But I do have to admit--

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and with personal experience,
as well as research--

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
that physical time travel
is possible, though rare.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Physicist Ron Mallett
was obsessed with time travel,

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.990 align:middle line:84%
wanted to go back into
time to see his father.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But he talks about some of the
possibilities of time travel.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Yeah.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.408 align:middle line:10%
>>RONALD MALLETT:
Scientific people

00:06:29.408 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:10%
know very well that time
is just a kind of space,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:10%
and we can move forward
and backward in time

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.600 align:middle line:10%
just as we can in space.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I read that, it
was like balm to my soul.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:90%
I thought, this is it.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:84%
If I can build a
time machine, then I

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.153 align:middle line:84%
can go back to see my
father again, and tell him

00:06:46.153 --> 00:06:48.320 align:middle line:84%
what was going to happen,
and maybe change his life.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So that became my
mission in life.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLETT: That's when I
really became interested

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:90%
in time travel.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You were obsessed
with time travel to go back--

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:10%
>>MALLETT: Exactly.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.348 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and talk
to your father,

00:06:56.348 --> 00:06:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and say, dad, you
got to be healthy.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:90%
You got to do this.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:90%
You got to do that.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLETT: Exactly.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is, is that--

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:90%
it was a secret mission.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I should say that,
even at 11 years old,

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I was astute enough to realize
that people were already

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:90%
worried about me.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And if I told them I wanted
to build a time machine,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that might not get
the right response.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:90%
So I kept it as a secret quest.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:90%
But that was the beginning.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, you mentioned Einstein.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that
was the thing--

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:90%
I knew this was science fiction.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLETT: And I had this
fantasy that it could be done.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, I would even
try to use the model that was

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:90%
on the cover of the magazine--

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.245 align:middle line:10%
>>MALLETT: And I tried
to put things together

00:07:31.245 --> 00:07:33.145 align:middle line:10%
with my father's old television.

00:07:33.145 --> 00:07:34.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: His tools
and stuff like that.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.880 align:middle line:10%
>>MALLETT: Right, and
everything like that.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.213 align:middle line:10%
And of course, nothing happened.

00:07:37.213 --> 00:07:40.200 align:middle line:84%
But it did say that scientific
people know very well.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So I knew it had something
to do with science.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of
years after that,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
when I was about 12 or 13, I
came across, you might say,

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:84%
the second book that changed
my life, and the second person.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And this was a book called "The
Universe and Dr. Einstein."

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.607 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLETT: I picked it up
in a Salvation Army store.

00:07:56.607 --> 00:07:58.440 align:middle line:10%
I should mention that,
after my father died,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.462 align:middle line:10%
we plunged into poverty.

00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, of course.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLETT: And so--

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Income stream was gone.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLETT: Exactly.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But I had this book
habit that I had to feed.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLETT: And I picked
it up for about a nickel.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, it had
a picture of Einstein next

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to an hourglass, so I knew
it must say that Einstein

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:90%
had something to do with time.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLETT: And even though
I couldn't understand

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
all the articulations
in the book, I did

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:84%
pick up the fact
that Einstein said

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:84%
that, unlike in
classical physics--

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:90%
the physics of Newton.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:84%
In Newton's physics, which
everyone is familiar with--

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: --time
cannot be altered.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Time cannot be changed.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Space cannot be changed.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's revolution was to
say that space and time can

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:90%
be altered.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:10%
So I knew if I could understand
how that could happen, then

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.530 align:middle line:10%
that would be the key for me
to building a time machine.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:10%
So Einstein became
my second obsession.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.388 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we went
back into time, Von--

00:08:48.388 --> 00:08:49.188 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Mhm.

00:08:49.188 --> 00:08:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and changed things--

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Mhm.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's say we went back
to the days of Jesus Christ--

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Mhm

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and saved
him from the cross,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.890 align:middle line:84%
could we change
things like that?

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: You know, I mean I
agree with your interview here.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
You can't really
alter spacetime.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I understand that.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But to say that you
can go back and alter

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:84%
someone's life, or
events in the past,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.870 align:middle line:90%
I think is highly unlikely.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have
good examples of it.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
We do have examples of people
that have come and made

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:90%
calls of warning.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: I think that
there's some built-in

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:90%
protection--

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it is-- that you

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
can't interfere with someone's
particular life course.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:84%
We call it karma, what
you will, or divine--

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:90%
your wheel--

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's already
set in stone, right?

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.972 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Yeah,
this is your life.

00:09:42.972 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I can't interfere
with your life.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Hence, I can't go back and
shoot Adolf Hitler in the head

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:90%
with a Luger.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.060 align:middle line:90%
I can't sign a contract.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I can't buy stock at
an amazingly low price

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.232 align:middle line:84%
or go where I know gold
will later be discovered.

00:09:58.232 --> 00:09:59.190 align:middle line:90%
You can't-- you can't--

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Buy Apple
stock or something.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: The
Apple stock, exactly.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And you think,
well, why is that?

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just think there's are
so many examples that indicate

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't happen, that
people go back in time and they

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:84%
tend to be what we would call--
or what Castaneda called--

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:90%
a perfect witness.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:90%
You are a perfect witness.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.720 align:middle line:90%
You go and you observe.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.050 align:middle line:84%
The shaman would go
back in time to observe

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:84%
what the ancestors say,
not to speak with them,

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.160 align:middle line:90%
but to listen to them.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
go forward in time

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.030 align:middle line:84%
to see what the future
holds for his or her people.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Not to interact.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe time
travel is not physical.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.795 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's like--

00:10:39.795 --> 00:10:41.295 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: I think
it is physical.

00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Here's where I'm going
to go out boldly--

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
until my next book, this
is my new theory, George,

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
is that we travel in
time, generally speaking,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
by sending our energy
bodies into another point

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:90%
on the continuous timeline.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:84%
That is to say that my
energy bodies have contained

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-- intelligent
energy, consciousness,

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.450 align:middle line:84%
which is universal consciousness
in all living things.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And it exists on my mental
body, my emotional body,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle line:84%
my causal body, my Buddhic
body, my atma, my-- all the way,

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.548 align:middle line:90%
And I know that this is true.

00:11:24.548 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:90%
I know that this is true.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And on every level
of our bodies--

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:84%
our energy bodies-- excluding
our physical bodies, just

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:84%
for the moment, that it
is energized consciousness

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
that exists on all these
levels, independent

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:90%
from our physical body.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And I get this from none other
than "The Chakras in the Human

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Energy Field."

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was written by Dora
van Gelder Kunz, and Dr. Shafica

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Karagulla.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who was my
aunt, by the way.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Who was your aunt.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: And I think
that is one of my bibles,

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
along with essays by
Einstein, because they

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
declare that, on every
subtle, body level,

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.160 align:middle line:90%
we have consciousness.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
We have intelligent
energy at work.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I think when we go
forward or backward in time,

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:84%
we tend to travel with
these six, or whatever,

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.280 align:middle line:90%
subtle energy bodies.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes,
sometimes, the evidence

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:84%
would indicate the
physical body goes with it.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.570 align:middle line:90%
And why not?

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get into an
altered state of consciousness,

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
as most people do in going
through a time shift or time

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.410 align:middle line:90%
slip, that you go into--

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:84%
you leave behind your
five physical senses.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:84%
You no longer see with
these physical eyes,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:84%
but you see with new eyes
and you hear with new ears.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And you are now
living with a new set

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
of feelers, which
is your awareness--

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:90%
your conscious awareness.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And your conscious
awareness is, in many ways,

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
much keener than your
five physical senses.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:90%
So when you have that--

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
when you make that shift
to go into a heightened

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:84%
state of consciousness,
this consciousness shift

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:84%
allows you to observe
things with new awareness,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:90%
with new eyes.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see beyond the
ground in front of your feet,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.860 align:middle line:84%
which is why we call
this the here and now.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:90%
It's what we see.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It's where we stand
on the conveyor

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:84%
belt that is the
everlasting time loop that

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:90%
goes on and on and on.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:84%
You can see that there are other
points, or as Einstein said,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.170 align:middle line:90%
other now moments--

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:90%
other moments that are just as--

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:90%
instances of the now.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Here's now, and then there's
now, and then there's now.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's multiple nows.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:84%
We only see the now that's
right in front of us.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And we only see with
our physical eyes.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
What is required is to
go into a heightened

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
state of consciousness, and
assume this new awareness,

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and see with new eyes, and
realize that there are places

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:84%
on this conveyor belt we
call the timeline that you

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.280 align:middle line:90%
can jump aboard.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.515 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will
technology get us there?

00:14:19.515 --> 00:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: I
don't see why not.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a theosophist,
so Madame Blavatsky often

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
told us that science and
the world of the phenomena--

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
the mystic's world--
would eventually

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:90%
join hands and work together.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is time shift?

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Time shift is--

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:84%
I try to differentiate between
time slips, which are almost

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.158 align:middle line:90%
accidental slips in time.

00:14:46.158 --> 00:14:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Quirks in
the system, right?

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Yeah,
they're little-- they're

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:90%
little sidesteps you make.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're almost
little stumbles we

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:90%
make into a portal of time.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:90%
We somehow discover--

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A quantum leap.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: A quantum leap.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.430 align:middle line:84%
You know what time shifts
are, are more programmed

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:90%
and thought out.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
that do time shifts.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:84%
We have the mystics,
the shamans.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:90%
We have the Samadhi mystics.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a story of the
couple that came into the town,

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: It's
a classic story.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was
unique when I heard it.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:90%
But I find--

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True story?

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.602 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: It's a true story.

00:15:24.602 --> 00:15:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And I find that when
I tell the story,

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
other people come up and say,
I had the same experience.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:90%
So here's the story.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:90%
This is Larry and Claire Miller.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And they live in
Alsip, Illinois.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of
southeast Chicago.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to take a
trip from southeast Chicago

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:90%
to New Mexico, in 1990.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:90%
They get in their car.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And when they get to Missouri,
they encounter a detour

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:90%
off Highway 44.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So Larry gets the family station
wagon going on the detour.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:84%
They go 15 minutes,
and they pull off.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And Claire says, "Look
it's a quaint old town.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's look."

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And it is really-- it's a
throwback town, you know?

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So they drive down and there's
children playing hopscotch

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:90%
in the park.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This sounds like
a "Twilight Zone" episode.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.025 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: There was a
"Twilight Zone" like this,

00:16:17.025 --> 00:16:18.480 align:middle line:90%
to show you how common this is.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.613 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Escape to Willoughby."

00:16:20.613 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: "Escape to
Willoughby"-- you've heard it.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But this isn't the
story of the Millers.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:90%
So they see the big clock.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.620 align:middle line:90%
And the clock says 12:00.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And Claire's clock--
watch says 3:00.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.440 align:middle line:84%
She says, "Well, they
don't keep time here."

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:90%
And there's very little traffic.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's very few people
in the town that they can see.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:90%
And there's this old clock.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:90%
And it has Roman numerals.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
They had very distinct
memories of this.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And Claire says,
"Larry, this is strange.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's get out of
here and go back."

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:90%
And they get on the--

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was
uncomfortable with this.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Get
uncomfortable, and they--

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.797 align:middle line:84%
and he says, "Oh, we're getting
out of here fast, Claire."

00:16:59.797 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And he puts the
pedal to the metal.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.942 align:middle line:84%
And they go 15 minutes
at a high rate of speed,

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and they pull off
to the next side.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Let's
check this one out."

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
It's the same town, except
that the clock is now--

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:90%
instead of noon, it's 12:30.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Everything is the same.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman
with the red hair,

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:84%
pushing a baby buggy, kids
playing hopscotch in the park,

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:90%
and the clock.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's crazy.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.200 align:middle line:90%
So they get on the detour again.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:90%
And he races even faster.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:90%
He's going high rates of speed--

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes, find another town.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Pulls off, the same thing.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:90%
And now it's one o'clock.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, uh-uh,
it's not one o'clock.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:90%
So they do it again.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:90%
Four times this happens.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, what
are we're going to do?

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:90%
And they get back.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.747 align:middle line:90%
And luckily they find--

00:17:52.747 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They felt trapped and--

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.372 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: They felt trapped.

00:17:55.372 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:90%
They were in a time loop.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And she accuses her husband,
Larry, of going in a circle.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:84%
But he says, "Oh, we're going
straight on this detour."

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:90%
And the clock is always crazy.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So once they got Highway
44, they were fine,

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:90%
and it never happened again.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:84%
But when they got back,
they related their story

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.030 align:middle line:84%
to a friend of
mine, Frank Joseph,

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
who is an author
and a researcher

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:90%
of ancient mysteries.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And he told him the story,
for a book he was writing.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:90%
And I got the story from Frank.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And the odd thing is that Larry
is a no-nonsense businessman.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: He is--

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very practical.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: --very
practical and he

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:middle line:84%
doesn't believe
in the paranormal.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:84%
But he had no way, nor did
Claire, of explaining it.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:90%
And they saw the same thing.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So I love these stories
that have collaboration.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.648 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they in
some kind of time warp?

00:18:50.648 --> 00:18:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Yeah,
it seems like they

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.478 align:middle line:90%
were caught in a time warp.

00:18:53.478 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A vortex or something.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: A vortex,
a portal, or something.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just kept
going on and on and on.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Yeah, and I
think that makes sense,

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
because we know there are
magnetic fields in the earth

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.790 align:middle line:90%
where everything goes crazy.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I live on an island
where you can't use a compass

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.547 align:middle line:90%
because it's--

00:19:09.547 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The magnetics are nuts.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Doesn't work, yeah.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I interviewed
host Emery Smith

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:84%
on "Gaia's Cosmic Disclosure"
about time and reality.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.478 align:middle line:10%
>>EMERY SMITH: Time is a
very sensitive subject,

00:19:21.478 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:10%
with the physicists and the
scientists around the world

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:10%
that are not part of the
clandestine projects,

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:10%
because it's a hard
thing to grasp.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Because time really
doesn't exist.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on is,
there's multiple levels

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:84%
of time, right now, and multiple
different types of realities

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:90%
and dimensions.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So there is a dimension,
right now, just

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:84%
within a different frequency,
right now, where you are here

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here, and it's just
a little bit different.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these coffee cups are
not here, or the cameras,

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:84%
or it might be some
different people.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Because there's many
different levels.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:84%
The hardest thing to explain
is that time is irrelevant

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
because you are already here,
everywhere, all the time.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Which means-- and that
sounds confusing--

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.415 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But don't go back
and see your grandfather--

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: But--

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big question I get.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Like, what if you go back in
time and you did something?

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, you just create
another time reality.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:90%
So that's another space of time.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:84%
But you're still where
you're at, right now.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you think you can go
back and remove the coffee

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:84%
mug, and then all of a
sudden it's not there,

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work that way at all.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.467 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if you
wanted to go back into time,

00:20:31.467 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and do away with Hitler,
and prevent World War

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.430 align:middle line:84%
II, and the Holocaust, and all
that horror that he created,

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:84%
what would happen if
you went back into time,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:84%
took care of him--
got rid of him--

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and what would the
consequences be?

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Consequences
would not affect you,

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.965 align:middle line:84%
because in this reality
that never happened.

00:20:51.965 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But would there be a
reality, somewhere--

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: There is.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --where it did happen?

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Correct.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.582 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
would happen there?

00:20:58.582 --> 00:21:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it's what's
happening right now.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the paradigm
here, is trying

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:84%
to put all that
together, saying, OK,

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:84%
there are multiple
dimensional realities,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and there's multiple
different types of time zones

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:90%
that we are all part of.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
We are interdimensional,
multiple dimension beings.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's where frequency comes
in, with DNA, and genetics,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and how we affect other
worlds, and other places

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.300 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, where the
light we see from the stars

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.670 align:middle line:84%
today, that star
might already be out.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But because of this
distance and time continuum,

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:84%
we don't really think about
that and realize that.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know what's so
bizarre about all this, Von?

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:90%
That this is all possible.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Yes.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:10%
>>BRASCHLER: Yes, and
I think it becomes

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:10%
very real for a lot of
people, who become somehow,

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:10%
on some level, aware
that they are existing

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:10%
in another parallel
reality, parallel world,

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.590 align:middle line:10%
parallel universe.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I think it's extremely likely
that we're all just layered.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:84%
This physics theory that
we're just layered realities,

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:90%
and we're so close.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
We're only separated by
maybe a tiny little place.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But the light
can't reach around.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:84%
If the light could reach around,
we would be as one with them.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.410 align:middle line:90%
But we're somehow separated.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But many people
will have dreams,

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and they'll have
very lucid dreams,

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.910 align:middle line:84%
or they'll have flashbacks,
or déjà vu moments--

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: --where
they seem to recall

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:84%
living this separate
but similar reality.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.297 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
very true that we--

00:22:41.297 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could this
be the multiverse?

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: The
multiverse, thank you.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's absolutely true.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you're right.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.508 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Now,
as to what he was

00:22:48.508 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:84%
saying about the level of change
you can create, I don't know.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't know.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.160 align:middle line:90%
That's above my pay grade.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:84%
We'll call up Professor
Einstein from beyond.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:90%
We'll go back and pass--

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.580 align:middle line:84%
in the past, we'll
talk to the professor.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
It would seem that there's some
built-in safeguards, that--

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:84%
some bumpers that you cannot
change this reality by this

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:90%
other reality.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.500 align:middle line:84%
But we do seem to have what
was the Seth theory of Jane

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Roberts, that we create
our new realities,

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:84%
our other probable
realities, all the time,

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:84%
through our mental and emotional
energy that we project out,

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:90%
through thought forms.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.283 align:middle line:90%
We create this.

00:23:35.283 --> 00:23:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us
about Brightwood.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: So I
moved to Oregon.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was really fun,
but I didn't realize

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.130 align:middle line:90%
the woods were enchanted.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, some places just
seem to be enchanted.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:84%
They told me that you could
bury things in the ground

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and things would happen
and that the Warm Spring

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Indians of Mount Hood in Oregon
had long considered Brightwood

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:90%
as a very sacred place.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:84%
They would meet
there in the summer--

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:90%
hence the term bright woods.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And they would gather there, and
they would talk to the trees,

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and they would have their
gathering and their potlatch.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And they would bury
things in the Earth.

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:84%
It was a time of
commemoration and reflection.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I was thinking
about all this

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and this Indian just
pops in front of me.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm out walking in the woods.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if he was
a chief, or he was a shaman,

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.480 align:middle line:90%
but he was highly decorated--

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:34.990 align:middle line:84%
ceremonial robes, feathers,
paint, very tall, a lot of red

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:90%
in the coloring of what he wore.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:90%
And I was shocked to see him.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:40.960 align:middle line:90%
I said, whoa!

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And he and he looked
back, and he goes, oh!

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.567 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was shocked
to see you, too.

00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Yeah, and I
said, "You don't belong here."

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.230 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Go!"

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.220 align:middle line:90%
And then he poof.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right in front of you?

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.267 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: In front of me.

00:24:55.267 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
that I was probably

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:02.787 align:middle line:84%
addressing a shaman, probably
from another time period.

00:25:02.787 --> 00:25:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who was time traveling.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Who
was time traveling.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:90%
This is what they do.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:84%
They go, and they
look in on things,

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and they come back
and say, well, I

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:84%
saw this man in the
woods, and he said, whoa.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what they gather
from when they're out there.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:90%
But, yes, that's what I did.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:90%
I saw him.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:90%
And it was profound.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And it was very vivid.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was
the only one who

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:84%
had these strange
encounters on Mount Hood,

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.340 align:middle line:84%
but it's just one
of those places--

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
there are others--
where these things just

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:90%
seem to happen, over and over.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a strange
call from somebody-- some older

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.160 align:middle line:90%
gentleman.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Oh, yeah.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.968 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened there?

00:25:40.968 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: That was a call
that really changed my life.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I was working at
the headquarters

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:84%
of the Theosophical
Society in Illinois.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't been
there very long.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:90%
And we were doing--

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.660 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of projects.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:90%
I was really, really busy.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was up on the third floor
of the publication building,

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and the phone rings, and
a man, as clear as day,

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.300 align:middle line:90%
speaking to me.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
But I'm having some trouble,
because he sounds very elderly

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and he has a thick
Indian accent,

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:90%
as though he's from India.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:90%
But it was very clear.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, this happens in the
80's, George, so I'm thinking,

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:84%
like, whoa, if he's
calling me from as far as I

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:84%
think he's calling me from,
how can this call be so clear?

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, my phone rang.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a dream.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:90%
My phone rang.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And I shared this office with
another person, down the hall,

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You picked it up.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.117 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: I picked it up.

00:26:34.117 --> 00:26:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Hello sir.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I am calling you to
invite you on a trip--

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.820 align:middle line:90%
a lightning rod tour of India.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I make these lightning
tours of India,

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:84%
every year, in late
August or early September.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.010 align:middle line:90%
It is the best time, sir.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, it is
the best time."

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "You
must come with me.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.580 align:middle line:84%
It will change your life
forever to experience

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:90%
what I have to show you."

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And I keep telling
him, "I can't go.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:90%
I just started this job.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.625 align:middle line:90%
It sounds wonderful."

00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.562 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: I can't up and go.

00:27:05.562 --> 00:27:08.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You must be calling
for my predecessor, Clarence

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Patterson, who started
this publishing company."

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Because he
just retired, and I--"

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
"No," he said "Sir, I
am calling for you."

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I must tell you
that we didn't seem

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:90%
to have a two-way conversation.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But he seemed to anticipate
what I was going to say,

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and he would say something
that seemed appropriate.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot of these
calls you get, sometimes you--

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.950 align:middle line:84%
these mysterious calls,
you just don't seem

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.940 align:middle line:90%
to have a lot of interaction.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So he just keeps pumping me
about, you got to go to India.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And so he says, "I
will call you again,

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.100 align:middle line:84%
sir, after you've had
time to reflect on this,

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and the importance
of this offer."

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:90%
And I think, that's weird.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
He calls again, he
makes the same offer,

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:90%
and I have the same response.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And so this time, I go
to the other building,

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:90%
across the street--

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:90%
the main building.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, who's
faking these calls?

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's setting you up?

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Who's
setting me up?

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be
a certain voice,

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.830 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think a
young woman could have

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:90%
thrown her voice like this.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm interviewing everybody
I think could have faked it.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.455 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at them in
the eye, and I'm looking for--

00:28:13.455 --> 00:28:14.997 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looking
for anything, right?

00:28:14.997 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: --a smile, a smirk,
a little twitch of the eye,

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:90%
a nervous twitch, or a laugh--

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.040 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.260 align:middle line:90%
They look at me like I'm crazy.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So I go to the lady that does
the switchboard operator,

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:90%
across the street.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:84%
She gets the incoming
calls on the 800 number,

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
or the calls that need to
be redirected to offices.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Donna, a
man called on these days.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And he had a really
thick accent,

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and he sounded very old, and he
sounded like he was from India.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember
transferring them to me?"

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.990 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Von," and said,
"I would remember something

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.950 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.200 align:middle line:90%
He called you directly."

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:90%
He called a third time.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:55.892 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "If you--

00:28:55.892 --> 00:28:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Persistent guy, huh?

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Yes.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:02.530 align:middle line:84%
He says, "If you do not go
on this lightning round trip

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.780 align:middle line:84%
to India with me,
there's one more

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:90%
thing I can offer you, sir.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.890 align:middle line:84%
You must learn to
meditate in the light.

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:11.980 align:middle line:84%
You must learn to meditate
in the morning light,

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:90%
beside running water."

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, I think
I can find a blanket."

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:90%
He says, "You must find"--

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:90%
he runs right over me.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.760 align:middle line:84%
"You must find
running water, sir,

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and do this in the
early morning light.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:90%
It will change your life.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.570 align:middle line:90%
You will move in the light.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.430 align:middle line:90%
You will travel in the light.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.180 align:middle line:84%
You will become one
with the light."

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Sounds pretty good.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So I started doing
this and he's right.

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:38.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just the most
amazing, moving experience

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:90%
to meditate like this.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking, like,
OK, who is this guy?

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.620 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't call
after the third time.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.070 align:middle line:84%
So I go downstairs, where
we have a bookshop--

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.460 align:middle line:90%
the Quest Bookshop--

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.980 align:middle line:90%
in Wheaton, Illinois.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And I go in there and I
talked to the manager.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Now, where do
you keep the really good books

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:90%
on meditation and yoga?"

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.250 align:middle line:84%
She said, "What do you
mean by good, Von?"

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, "The ones written
by the people in India--

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.980 align:middle line:84%
the real masters,
the real yogis--

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:90%
where do you keep them?

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't want all
this new age stuff."

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.930 align:middle line:90%
I want the real thing.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.600 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Oh, they're
down there in the corner.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Just keep walking."

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:90%
And I'm walking in the corner.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And I swear to you,
it was on an easel.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:24.690 align:middle line:84%
This book is-- it was face out,
on an easel, staring at me.

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And I pick it up and it was all
about meditating in the morning

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.400 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about that?

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: And I flip
it over, and I'm reading,

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:90%
reading, reading, reading.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And this yogi master,
he's an old man.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's also famous for leading
lightning tours of India,

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:90%
in the fall.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's the
one who called you.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: He's the
one who called me.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm thinking,
like, oh, my gosh.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.980 align:middle line:90%
And I drop the book and I run.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:54.550 align:middle line:84%
But before I drop the book, I
read the last line on the back.

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:59.700 align:middle line:84%
It gave the man's date of
birth and his date of death.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.580 align:middle line:90%
He called me from beyond.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The other side.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: From
the other side.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So I did this and I learned
that not only could I have

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.630 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous out-of-body
experience by meditating

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:84%
in the light, but it was
profound that I could move

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.230 align:middle line:84%
my subtle energy
bodies in the light,

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.840 align:middle line:84%
if I did this with running
water in the morning light--

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.190 align:middle line:90%
natural light, you know?

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So I had a friend, later on when
I moved, who was a roommate.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.860 align:middle line:84%
She was dying of
brain cancer and she

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:90%
was in the hospice program.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And the nuns said, "There's
not much you can do.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Deb's waiting to die.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.122 align:middle line:90%
That's her job."

00:31:36.122 --> 00:31:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, I'm going
to make it as pleasant for her

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make it possible
for Deb to walk out of here."

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.000 align:middle line:84%
They said, "Nobody
walks out of here, Von."

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Deb will."

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I go to Deb, who didn't
believe in any of this.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: And I said, "Deb,
you love 'Star Trek.'" She

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.070 align:middle line:90%
said, "Mm."

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.773 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't speak anymore.

00:31:54.773 --> 00:31:55.690 align:middle line:90%
She was that far gone.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.060 align:middle line:90%
She'd go, mm.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "You love 'Star
Trek.'" I said, "You know,

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:84%
they go in there and they
rematerialize somewhere else.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.240 align:middle line:84%
How would you like
to do it, Deb?"

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.490 align:middle line:90%
She said, "Mm."

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I said, "How would you
like to walk out of here?"

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So we start this thing, where
I move her bed a little bit

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:84%
in front of the light
from the window.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And I come in the morning--
the early morning light--

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and I have one of
these little waterfalls

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.440 align:middle line:90%
you can put on a desk.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Little models-- we hear the
water, the running water.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And we do this and we start
going, traveling in the light.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And we go from, like,
different planes of existence.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.540 align:middle line:84%
We're just taking
our energy bodies,

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'm holding her hand, and
we're meditating in the light

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:38.810 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And we go through
the emotional plane.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.190 align:middle line:90%
We go to the mental plane.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:45.530 align:middle line:90%
We go the causal plane.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.610 align:middle line:90%
The Buddhic plane.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:47.660 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And we got up there,
to the Buddhic plane.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:84%
It was all very blue, and
starting to get purple.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, like, I
can't go with Deb any farther.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.710 align:middle line:90%
I can't go where Deb's going.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.998 align:middle line:90%
I come back, and we come back.

00:33:03.998 --> 00:33:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Deb, you're getting
really good at this-- really

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.340 align:middle line:90%
good at this.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you can
do it on your own?

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Can you walk out of here on your
own, using these meditations?

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Can you do it?"

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.180 align:middle line:84%
She squeezed my hand
and said the first word

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.260 align:middle line:90%
she'd spoken in months.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.185 align:middle line:90%
She said, "Yes."

00:33:21.185 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a synchronicity

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:23.400 align:middle line:90%
behind any of this?

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Absolutely.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Because the woman, who
was the head nurse there,

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.420 align:middle line:90%
was also the head nun.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Sister Luke.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.915 align:middle line:84%
She died, shortly after Deb
died, of the same thing--

00:33:36.915 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:90%
a brain tumor--

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and she died in a
hospice program.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And the woman in the
bookstore, Quest, in Illinois,

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:50.760 align:middle line:84%
she died of a brain tumor,
also in home hospice care,

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.710 align:middle line:90%
shortly after I spoke with her.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:54.450 align:middle line:90%
There was synchronicity.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A Gaia
host, Crotalo Sesamo,

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.535 align:middle line:84%
talks about synchronicity
just like you.

00:34:00.535 --> 00:34:01.335 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Yeah.

00:34:01.335 --> 00:34:02.135 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:02.135 --> 00:34:04.560 align:middle line:10%
>>CROTALO SESAMO: Synchronicity
is not positive and is not

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.760 align:middle line:10%
negative.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.770 align:middle line:10%
In a certain way,
we might imagine

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:10%
that synchronicity
is exactly what

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.449 align:middle line:10%
is a positive event for us.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I might need a pair of
shoes that is number eight.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.120 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have the
money in that moment

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to buy the shoes
and my heart broken,

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.350 align:middle line:84%
so I really need
this pair of shoes.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine that exactly in
that moment, from a van that

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.380 align:middle line:84%
is crossing the road,
a door is opening

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and a box, with a pair of
shoes, with number eight,

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:84%
is just there, falling
in front of me.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Wow, this is perfect,
positive synchronicity.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably our
interpretation about that.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But there is not a positive
or negative synchronicity.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.010 align:middle line:90%
There's always synchronicity.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.929 align:middle line:10%
That means that every
single event that

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.690 align:middle line:10%
is happening in our
lives, I mean, are not bad

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:55.830 align:middle line:10%
and they are not good.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.560 align:middle line:90%
They are opportunities.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.790 align:middle line:84%
If time is this territory--
is this huge sphere

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.570 align:middle line:84%
that contain everything--
also the different universe,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and everything that is
possible, here and there.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me just
try now to see how

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.470 align:middle line:84%
time is working
with synchronicity,

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and with complexity.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.910 align:middle line:10%
So if everything is there--

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:22.980 align:middle line:10%
if time is containing
everything--

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.960 align:middle line:10%
what is moving?

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:10%
Is moving my consciousness?

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.500 align:middle line:10%
Is moving my soul?

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.130 align:middle line:10%
That means that this
soul can contemporary

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:35.270 align:middle line:10%
live multiple reality.

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:39.920 align:middle line:84%
This soul can live contemporary,
in many different life forms,

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.770 align:middle line:84%
at the same exactly
moment, even if it

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:46.280 align:middle line:84%
looks that, in this moment,
right, I'm talking to you,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.840 align:middle line:90%
it looks that you're here.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:90%
You're watching me.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.360 align:middle line:90%
You're listening my words.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.240 align:middle line:84%
You might have a lot of
thoughts or question mark.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But you feel that you
are in this place.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:00.980 align:middle line:84%
If we can just increase our
perception, our consciousness,

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:84%
we might discover that,
well, I'm here now,

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.510 align:middle line:84%
but I'm here in many
different places.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here, also, in
many different life forms.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever seen
yourself in other time periods?

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Yes.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it like?

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: Well, you feel
a great attachment to it

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.250 align:middle line:90%
and you almost want to stay.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:23.050 align:middle line:90%
It--

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And has
that you seen you?

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: I'm seeing
someone else who is like me--

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:34.810 align:middle line:90%
an earlier me or another me.

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very aware of
another me, even now.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.070 align:middle line:90%
And I wish him well.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And everything this man
just said in this video clip

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.170 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely true.

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:90%
This is a profound statement.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And this combines everything
that we're saying here today.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It's all interconnected
because we're all

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:04.630 align:middle line:84%
going through so many
synchronistic learning

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:10.750 align:middle line:84%
exercises, opportunities
where our consciousness is

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:16.780 align:middle line:84%
being asked to measure up to
the universal consciousness.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.650 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly
being upschooled.

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And we get-- there's a
pattern to synchronicity,

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.700 align:middle line:84%
because if you didn't
get it the first time,

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:84%
it'll be slightly different in
the presentation the next time,

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and the next time, until
you have to pay attention,

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and learn, and observe
what's in front of you.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lucid dreaming--
is that part of time travel?

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Absolutely.

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:44.540 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: My next book--

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.280 align:middle line:84%
two books-- are going
to be on lucid dreaming.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, "Time Shifts,"
I talk about lucid dreaming.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:56.350 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
program lucid dreams.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:59.080 align:middle line:84%
You can program
your lucid dreams

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:04.210 align:middle line:84%
to go to another point in time
and another point in space,

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and you will really,
actually go there.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether you're physically
there or just in an energy

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:14.590 align:middle line:84%
body, you're most likely going
to be there in an energy body,

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.230 align:middle line:90%
I think, for most cases.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to
be very profound.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.450 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
tremendous insight from it.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:90%
It's like the hero's journey.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The hero's journey is a
metaphor for opening our eyes,

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and seeing, and learning,
in this great adventure we

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.660 align:middle line:90%
call our life.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you induce
time travel, Von?

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Yes.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At will?

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: At will.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.170 align:middle line:90%
It takes some discipline.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can do it through
meditation or lucid dreaming.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And the techniques are
basically the same.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:49.150 align:middle line:84%
But what I always advocate doing
is visualizing what you want.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And the best visualizations,
the best meditations, I think,

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.090 align:middle line:84%
are where you don't
use words, or sounds,

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:56.470 align:middle line:90%
or thoughts, or memories.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:58.960 align:middle line:84%
You're painting a picture--
drawing a picture--

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.540 align:middle line:84%
on a blank slate
in your mind's--

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.160 align:middle line:90%
in front of your mind's eye.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And on this blank slate,
you're visualizing

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.200 align:middle line:84%
exactly what you want to
see, where you want to go.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.350 align:middle line:90%
It's best you can determine it.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And it can be vague, because
it's your sketch map.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you tuck it in the
back of your consciousness.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.050 align:middle line:90%
You prepare yourself to leave.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Then, when it comes back, it's
a posthypnotic suggestion.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:28.030 align:middle line:84%
When that map comes in front
of your eyes, you are gone.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:32.950 align:middle line:84%
You use it as an unerring map to
take you where you want to go.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.187 align:middle line:84%
And you can visualize almost
any place you want to go.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.680 align:middle line:10%
this three-fold meditation
on a particular thing,

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:10%
be it the planets, or the
sky, or a part of your body,

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:28.662 align:middle line:10%
or so forth, you will get
this particular power.

00:40:28.662 --> 00:40:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>> While Patanjali doesn't
discourage these supernormal

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:36.020 align:middle line:84%
states, he also makes it clear
that the siddhis are potential

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.653 align:middle line:90%
impediments to the goal of yoga.

00:40:38.653 --> 00:40:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLINSON: Yoga has always
been closely associated

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.280 align:middle line:84%
with the siddhis and it's
clear that he doesn't see it

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.550 align:middle line:84%
as a bad thing if you
strive directly to get

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:49.010 align:middle line:90%
these supernatural powers.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:51.320 align:middle line:84%
He goes through
20 or 30 of them.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So why would he do that if he
thought it was a bad thing?

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLINSON: And he does
say, about three of them,

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:59.660 align:middle line:84%
that they are not to be
pursued, that the direct aim

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.032 align:middle line:84%
for those ones is a hindrance
to the final goal of yoga.

00:41:03.032 --> 00:41:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't say
that about the others.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.323 align:middle line:84%
So it's a hard one to understand
because later texts certainly

00:41:07.323 --> 00:41:10.310 align:middle line:84%
do say that pursuing siddhis
directly is a bad thing,

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is an obstacle to the
ultimate goal of yoga.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:15.515 align:middle line:90%
But Patanjali is not so clear.

00:41:15.515 --> 00:41:18.040 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HAREESH WALLIS: My
sense of it is probably,

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.080 align:middle line:84%
at a certain period in
history, a certain period

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:28.540 align:middle line:84%
in Indian society, no one
disbelieved in these powers,

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:90%
in these siddhis.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think collective
consciousness

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.930 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly powerful.

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I think people actually
really could do things,

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that we don't see
now, because we

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.750 align:middle line:84%
don't have the sort of
critical mass of total faith

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.260 align:middle line:90%
in those possibilities.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So if consciousness is creating
reality, moment-to-moment,

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.210 align:middle line:90%
why shouldn't that be possible?

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a danger
in time travel, Von?

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: I don't think so.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:52.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:53.643 align:middle line:90%
And I have studied Patanjali's--

00:41:53.643 --> 00:41:56.690 align:middle line:90%


00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.180 align:middle line:90%
"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali."

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.990 align:middle line:84%
The first part is,
you're preparing the body

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.850 align:middle line:90%
to meditate--

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.970 align:middle line:90%
the postures and so forth.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And the second one is
a more mystic approach.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And you get to the
last third of the book,

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.270 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get into magic.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:17.750 align:middle line:84%
You need to read the "Yoga
Sutras of Patanjali."

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:19.010 align:middle line:90%
That is the book.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:84%
The point being made, I think
here, is very important.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:27.020 align:middle line:84%
You follow the
sutras so carefully

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.590 align:middle line:84%
that they become
slavish into themselves.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I'm a Westerner, and
I don't do it quite this way.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.280 align:middle line:84%
The Westerner likes to cut
right through to the chase.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.460 align:middle line:84%
The points being
made are profound.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:45.560 align:middle line:10%
The goal of the
book of Patanjali

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.770 align:middle line:10%
is really a study
in samadhi mysticism

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:54.650 align:middle line:10%
or the study of consciousness,
which is, of course, raja yoga.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:56.450 align:middle line:10%
It is alaya yoga.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:57.963 align:middle line:90%
It is bhakti yoga.

00:42:57.963 --> 00:42:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe the
next time we see you,

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:01.382 align:middle line:90%
you'll be time traveling again.

00:43:01.382 --> 00:43:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BRASCHLER: I'll
time travel here.

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Von, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BRASCHLER: Thank you, George.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:06.860 align:middle line:90%
I really liked it.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Time travel-- it is
fascinating and, maybe one day,

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.770 align:middle line:84%
very probable for
a lot of people.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
