00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:10%
George Noory with you with our
special guest Tom Campbell.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, who is Tom Campbell?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:84%
He's a very serious
explorer of the frontiers

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.640 align:middle line:84%
of reality, the
mind, consciousness,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:90%
and psychic phenomenon.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:84%
He's been doing it for
more than 40 years.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Tom, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TOM CAMPBELL:
Thank you, George.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:10%
Glad to be here.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.668 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 40 years
you've been doing this?

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:45.820 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMPBELL: 40 years.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did
this start for you?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMPBELL: Well, I was
in graduate school working

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:10%
on my PhD, and I saw
a notice that said

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.990 align:middle line:10%
learn how to meditate.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Special for students, $25.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:90%
That's where it started.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:84%
I paid my $25 because I wanted
to get by on less sleep.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Graduate students tend to
work long hours, particularly

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:84%
in experimental physics like
I was in, so that started me.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And within two
months, I found out

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I could debug my software
in a meditation state

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
much faster and much
more effectively than I

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.440 align:middle line:84%
could actually looking
at the printout.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that
$25 was worth it?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: It was worth it.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And it opened up a whole
new reality for me,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.970 align:middle line:84%
because before, like
most physicists,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
if you can't measure it, it's
not real or it's irrelevant.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, that was
nothing I could measure,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:84%
but it was real, because
it was my software that was

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:90%
being debugged, and it worked.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you end up
getting the PhD in physics?

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: I did
not get the PhD.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:90%
I did get a PhD education.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I finished the thesis
and did all of that,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
but I was needed elsewhere,
and my major professor

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:84%
wanted me to do another
paper after the first one.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.807 align:middle line:84%
So I declined and went
out and started my life.

00:02:05.807 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And as you
started your life,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
you started talking about
investigating consciousness.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.822 align:middle line:90%
What did you uncover?

00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Well,
actually, what happened

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:84%
is that just after I
graduated and took a job,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I ran into Bob Monroe.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And Bob Monroe had
just built a building

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.388 align:middle line:84%
for studying consciousness, but
he didn't have any scientists.

00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Expert in
out-of-body experiences.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Expert.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So I agreed to be one of
his scientists for free

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:84%
if he would teach
me what he knew.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So I spent the next
five, six, seven

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:84%
years spending as much
as 20 hours a week

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:90%
with Bob Monroe in his lab.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And I was building equipment,
and I was doing experiments

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
with other people, but I also
was an experiment myself.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So Bob taught me how to
go out-of-body on demand,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and how to make that so stable
that I could do experiments

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.130 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:90%
I could do research there.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Change one variable,
do it again.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:90%
See if you get the same results.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.525 align:middle line:84%
Change another,
variable do it again.

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And doing that for
about 35 years,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought I understood
how it worked.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So then I wrote a book
about consciousness.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:84%
The "My Big Toe" book
has really started out

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:90%
as a theory of consciousness.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And being a physicist, I should
have picked up on it earlier,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:84%
because I knew consciousness
was fundamental,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.430 align:middle line:84%
short of the things
I learned there.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But about two years after
I published these books,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the same
concepts, the same ideas that

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:84%
explained consciousness also
explained quantum mechanics,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and that I could actually
derive quantum mechanics

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:90%
from consciousness theory.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought a little bit,
and I could derive relativity

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.812 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking around for
all the paradoxes in physics.

00:03:57.812 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Things that weren't answered.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.255 align:middle line:84%
Things that we know are
true because of experiments.

00:04:01.255 --> 00:04:02.963 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they were
all tied together.

00:04:02.963 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: We had no idea.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So I could understand
all of those paradoxes

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:90%
with this model.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So then I started moving in
into the physics as well.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's a model that
describes everything objective

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and everything subjective
at the same time.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was
younger, I picked up

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Bob Monroe's book,
"Journeys Out of the Body"

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and was fascinated by his
work with astral projection.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Are you able to astral
project at will?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Sure.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to do
that since probably being

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.645 align:middle line:90%
two years with Bob Monroe.

00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a gift.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Matter of fact, if
you look at Bob's second book,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
which was "Far Journeys," you
will find physicist TC is one

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:90%
of the--

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're the guy.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: I'm the guy.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Virtual reality.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, give me a
definition of that.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: OK.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Virtual reality goes by
a lot of different names,

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and the one that scientists
use is information-based.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:84%
It's an information-based
reality.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:84%
That's the same thing as
saying it's a computed reality.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the same as saying
it's a simulated reality.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a simulation or
a virtual reality.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words, all the things
we see, and feel, and hear,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and so on, are information.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's not too hard to
understand, because our senses,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.010 align:middle line:84%
we have five senses, and
they all gather information.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And our reality is how we
interpret that sense data.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We live in a virtual
reality world, they say.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Yes.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that real,
or is it made up?

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: That's real.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.260 align:middle line:84%
That we live in
a virtual reality

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
is the best metaphor
or the best assumption.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:84%
The best model that we
have now of reality.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Quantum mechanics.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And many physicists,
particularly

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:84%
the younger physicists
that are coming up today,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
believe that this is an
information-based reality,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
quantum physics tells us.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what relativity tells us.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Living in a virtual
reality world is interesting.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But I have always thought
of virtual reality

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:84%
as you have goggles on, and
you're looking at a video,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:90%
and you're in the video.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:84%
That's not exactly what
you're talking about, is it?

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: No, but it's close.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
If we talk about a virtual
reality game, people are--

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
we play virtual reality like
World of Warcraft or the Sims.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:90%
It's more like that.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:84%
But when you put on
the goggles, you're

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:84%
actually a participant
in that virtual reality.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So now we take two of those
and put them together,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.670 align:middle line:90%
and we have our physical bodies.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
The physical world is
the virtual reality.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:90%
So our body is the avatar.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:90%
We are consciousness.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And as consciousness, we're
the player of that avatar.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.105 align:middle line:90%
We make all the choices.

00:06:56.105 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Gregg Braden, on his Gaia
series "Missing Links,"

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.842 align:middle line:90%
talked about a simulated world.

00:07:03.842 --> 00:07:05.300 align:middle line:10%
>>GREGG BRADEN:
The characteristics

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:10%
of a simulated world.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.460 align:middle line:10%
A simulation has a
place where it begins,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:10%
a definite beginning, and it
has a place where it ends.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:10%
And what happens in between
that beginning and that ending

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:10%
is based on a mathematic
algorithm, a rhythm of cycles

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:10%
in patterns that repeat
again, and again,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:10%
and again on different scales.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:34.100 align:middle line:84%
In a simulation, there are rules
that govern the simulation.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.390 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is that as the
people in the simulation

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:10%
become more familiar
with the environment,

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:10%
as they learn those
rules, life gets better.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:90%
They improve with practice.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
In a simulation, users have
access to another reality that

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:90%
is not within the simulation.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:10%
In a simulation,
the users always

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:10%
have access to an
external reality

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.620 align:middle line:10%
that they can tap
into for guidance

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.670 align:middle line:10%
if they get into trouble or
if they need clarification.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:10%
They always have the
ability to communicate

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.868 align:middle line:10%
beyond the simulation itself.

00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:10%
That's going to be
really important in just

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:10%
a few minutes.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:10%
And in a simulation,
as I've just mentioned,

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:10%
the user cannot tell the
simulation from the real world.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:10%
All right?

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:10%
So these are the characteristics
of a modern simulation

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:10%
as we know it today, as we
use them today typically.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:10%
Now, with this in
mind, let's go back

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:10%
and look at what our most
ancient and cherished

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:10%
spiritual traditions from a
number of different religions

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:10%
tell us about the
world that we live in.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that
thousands of years

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:10%
ago, our ancestors were
trying to inform us,

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:10%
in a language of their time,
something that they understood

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:10%
that we are only
beginning to awaken

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:10%
to the possibility of
happening in our lives?

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:10%
That we are actually
in an artificial world,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.600 align:middle line:10%
a temporary world, that
has a beginning and an end.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:84%
That we're learning
something here,

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and that we have access to
an external guidance when

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.335 align:middle line:90%
we need that access.

00:09:16.335 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's kind
of scary, Tom,

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:84%
thinking that we live in
a virtual reality world.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:90%
To me it is.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:90%
To you probably not.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: No.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.448 align:middle line:84%
What do you find scary
about it, George?

00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's
just the unknown.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:84%
The fact that it may not
be as real as we think.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Or if it is real, it's
not what I expected.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMPBELL: Well, that brings
us to the definition of what's

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:10%
real, and I would say
that there is nothing

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.580 align:middle line:10%
more real than information.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Information is as
real as it gets.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, are we really
here together right now,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
or is that just a figment
of somebody's imagination?

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: No, we are here now.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not a figment of
somebody's imagination.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Virtual reality is--
it's not a fake reality.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.453 align:middle line:90%
It's reality.

00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not like there's
the virtual reality then

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:90%
there's the real reality.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But that thing
that we just heard,

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:84%
I can put that in a
little different terms

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
that will maybe
answer your question

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and make you feel a
little better about it.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.548 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Think of it like
the "World of Warcraft,"

00:10:12.548 --> 00:10:13.950 align:middle line:90%
like a virtual reality game.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:90%
And we are the player.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We, consciousness,
are the player.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you're the player,
you make all the choices

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:90%
for your avatar.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:84%
But the player, and the
computer that serves the game,

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
can't be inside the
virtual reality.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:84%
They have to be outside
the virtual reality.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And if they're outside
the virtual reality,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
then they have to be
non-physical from the viewpoint

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.905 align:middle line:90%
of inside the virtual reality.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So see, that's what
Gregg was saying.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
That we're consciousness,
therefore we're non-physical.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:84%
We're outside of
the virtual reality,

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.270 align:middle line:84%
but we're making the
choices of the avatars.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So as consciousness, we
can connect to all the rest

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.660 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:84%
All the information
that's out there.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what Gregg
was talking about.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:84%
There's another outside
source that you also

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:84%
can get help and guidance from,
and find information there.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So as consciousness,
we're not limited

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:90%
to just this virtual reality.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
We're also players in the
larger consciousness system.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
in the real world,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.160 align:middle line:90%
or are we in the virtual world?

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: The virtual world
is our physical universe.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe,
that's the virtual world.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
The real world is the
world of consciousness.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:90%
That's fundamental.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.780 align:middle line:84%
The virtual world is
a product, something

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:90%
generated within consciousness.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:90%
It's just information.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.618 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we overreact
with virtual reality?

00:11:39.618 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Well,
a lot of people do.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
When they hear that this
is a virtual reality,

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:84%
or they hear somebody
say that, they

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:84%
have the idea that oh, it
isn't the real reality.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It's somehow-- it's
a fake reality.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.190 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.732 align:middle line:84%
If this is a virtual
reality, then it

00:11:53.732 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter what I
do, because it's just

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:90%
the virtual reality.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
the real thing.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: It's
not the real thing.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And they have that
reaction to it,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.150 align:middle line:84%
but that is because they are
used to thinking of things

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:90%
as physical being real.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
This physical reality
is the real reality,

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and if we're in some
made-up virtual reality,

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:84%
then what difference
does it make what I do?

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, it makes
all the difference

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:90%
in the world what you do.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.840 align:middle line:90%
We're consciousness.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
We're the players
of these avatars.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:90%
And we have a job.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:90%
We are evolving.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
an evolving thing.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And the way consciousness
evolves, in technical terms,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:90%
is toward lower entropy.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:84%
In non-technical terms,
its toward caring.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Toward empathy.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Toward love.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:84%
That's how
consciousness evolves.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's our job, as pieces
of consciousness, to evolve.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what consciousness does.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So as we evolve,
we have to grow up.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:90%
Become caring.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Become less self-centered,
more about other, less

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.963 align:middle line:90%
about ourself.

00:13:02.963 --> 00:13:04.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's our mission here.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And we do that by
the choices we make.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So all these little choices
we make are critical.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.002 align:middle line:84%
They either help us evolve,
or they help us de-evolve.

00:13:13.002 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's our choice.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: It's our choice.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So these choices
are very important.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, well,
then I can do anything.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might do anything, but
you may de-evolve rather than

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:90%
evolve.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you continue
to de-evolve,

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:90%
then you become nothing.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:84%
You de-evolve and
become less and less.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.127 align:middle line:90%
You evolve, you become more.

00:13:33.127 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, you've heard
of the Akashic records.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Yes.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they, in your opinion?

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Well, the Akashic
records are a database.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It's information in a database.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And in my theory,
that database has

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:84%
to exist as part of the
mechanics of creating

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:90%
the virtual reality.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the virtual
reality and how it has to work,

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.340 align:middle line:84%
then that database is an
essential and necessary part

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So those Akashic
records maintain

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:09.530 align:middle line:84%
a history of everything
that has happened,

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
plus everything that
could have happened,

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and the probability that
it could have happened.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:84%
There's also in
there everything that

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
is possible to happen in the
future, that might happen,

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and the probability that
it actually will happen.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill Foster is an
expert on the Akashic records

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.803 align:middle line:84%
and was with me on a previous
"Beyond Belief" show.

00:14:31.803 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL FOSTER: The
Akashic records

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:84%
is sort of like God's library
in the higher dimensions,

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the planet where
your soul records are stored.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So everybody, you and
I, and everybody else

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, six billion
people plus right now,

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:90%
has a book of life.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's an energetic,
etheric book of life.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The good and the bad?

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.620 align:middle line:10%
>>FOSTER: Yes.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
All of your life experiences
from all of your lifetimes.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Past, present, future.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So if you've
had 20 different lives,

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.950 align:middle line:10%
reincarnated lives,
they're all in that rights?

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSTER: Exactly.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Or 20,000.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or 20,000.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:10%
So when you die, does
somebody open up that book

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:10%
and do a review of
what you've done?

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FOSTER: You do.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And there are special
teachers there.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:84%
They are teachers and
keepers of the records that

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:34.490 align:middle line:84%
are in this library
and school, where God,

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the
archangels, sometimes

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:84%
family members, whatever is
perfect for the individual.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
They're taken, and you look
at your lifetime, basically.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.230 align:middle line:84%
You look at your most
current lifetime,

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and you get to see what all
of your missed opportunities

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:84%
were, your
resentments, you know,

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:90%
things you need to work on.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:90%
And your triumphs.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
The things that
you've accomplished.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And because you're in the
higher dimensions at that time,

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:84%
you're able to see
beyond the moment.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're able
to look at the past.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And you see how this
lifetime correlates

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.018 align:middle line:90%
to your other lifetimes.

00:16:20.018 --> 00:16:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we, as the
authors of the Akashic records,

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.850 align:middle line:84%
constantly putting
information into it?

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Well, yes.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84%
As we make choices, then
those choices that we make

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:90%
are recorded.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And the things that happen
in the virtual reality, all

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
the action that takes place
in the virtual reality that's

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:84%
based on the choices that the
players make, is then recorded.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have that, which
would be in the past,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:84%
but we also have a
probable future as well.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.500 align:middle line:90%
There is free will.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:90%
The future is not a done deal.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:90%
But it's probability.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Some things are more
probable than others.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does that affect,
let's say, reincarnation?

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:84%
In that clip, we talked about
20 lives or 20,000 lives.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:90%
How does that affect that?

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Well, I might
add that in my model,

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't start out with
things like Akashic records

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and reincarnation and
then try to explain them

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.272 align:middle line:90%
with a scientific model.

00:17:16.272 --> 00:17:17.480 align:middle line:90%
It went the other way around.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:90%
I'm a physicist.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I started with physics
and understanding

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
the nature of reality and
nature of consciousness.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And these things like
the Akashic records

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and reincarnation turned out
to be a logical necessity

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:90%
in the model.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.217 align:middle line:84%
So if the model was going
to work and actually

00:17:35.217 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:84%
explain everything
in the objective

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and subjective worlds,
then these things

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:90%
had to be a logical part of it.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So I came at it from
the opposite direction.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:84%
The idea of reincarnation is
necessary, because our mission,

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:53.980 align:middle line:84%
as I said, is to become
love, to let go of fear.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Let go of self focus
and self-centeredness.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And that isn't an
easy thing to do.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:84%
That's something that means
you have to change yourself.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:90%
You have to change who you are.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to change the
way you see the world.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:90%
And that takes iteration.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Learning something
like that isn't going

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:90%
to happen in one giant step.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
It has to happen in a
series of experiences.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So yes, the
reincarnation then is

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.980 align:middle line:84%
something that is part of that
record as well, as he said.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Each of your lives, that's
you trying to evolve.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And all of that data
about how that happened

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and the choices you
made are recorded.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:90%
And they're there.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the horrible,
wretched person eventually

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:90%
become an enlightened person?

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.113 align:middle line:84%
Even after many, many
reincarnated lives?

00:18:41.113 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Well,
that's the goal.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
That even the horrible,
wretched person

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:84%
will one day turn
around and start moving

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:90%
toward love and away from fear.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:90%
But that's up to them.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:90%
You know, free will choice.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:10%
So that is typically what
happens, because the system

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:10%
will give that person--

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.090 align:middle line:10%
the next incarnation
will be such

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.428 align:middle line:10%
that it will be easier
for them to succeed.

00:19:05.428 --> 00:19:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or it should be.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Yeah.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.373 align:middle line:84%
And so then they'll
have a little success

00:19:09.373 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and then you build
on that excess.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So the system is trying to
help us succeed, because we

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:90%
are part of the system.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:90%
We're consciousness.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.100 align:middle line:90%
The system is consciousness.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So as we evolve, it evolves,
because we're it, it's us.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So the system wants
us to succeed.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So we get the
things that we need

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:90%
pretty much when we need them.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the difference,
Tom, between consciousness

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:90%
and subconsciousness?

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Well, there
actually is no subconscious

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:90%
if you get rid of fear.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a little different twist
on the Freudian model of mind,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.133 align:middle line:84%
and that is that fear
is where we create

00:19:53.133 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious to
deal with the things

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.630 align:middle line:84%
that we don't really
want to deal with.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
The things we push below
the surface, things

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:90%
that are uncomfortable for us.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Those things tend to
be in the subconscious.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you've developed
the subconscious,

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes that
unknown part of your life

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:84%
that just kind of
urges you to do things,

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're not quite sure
where that comes from.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Or eats away at you, too.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.703 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Or eats away at you.

00:20:17.703 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have that
fear, and if you are love--

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:84%
and when you don't have fear,
you are love, by the way.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.600 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way that works.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
At that point, you
are a whole person.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:90%
You understand all of you.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't have part of you
that is hidden from you.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.340 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of all of yourself.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.893 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of your needs.

00:20:39.893 --> 00:20:41.060 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of your hunger.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.808 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of your sexuality.

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
You're aware of what's going on
in your life and who you are.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:90%
You are authentic.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And in that stage, you
don't have a subconscious.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
You have an awareness
from top to bottom of who

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:90%
and what you are.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
Theory of Everything?

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Well, that
is the fundamental model

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:90%
that I published in 2003.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a theory of
consciousness that also turned

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:90%
into a theory of physics.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:17.807 align:middle line:84%
But what it does is it explains
everything that is objective.

00:21:17.807 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:84%
That would be science,
you know, the quantum

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:90%
mechanics and relativity.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And it explains everything
that's subjective,

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:90%
and that's a little different.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And people kind of have
to double-take on that.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Everything's subjective.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
That means that your
feelings, your situation,

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:84%
the level of your happiness,
or your misery, or pain.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:84%
All of that has an explanation
why it is you feel that way.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And this model,
then, will explain

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:90%
why did you feel that way?

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So it explains all the
subjective experiences we have.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
explains it, it means

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:84%
it hangs it on a
logical structure

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.740 align:middle line:90%
so that it makes sense.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
We can see where it
comes from, and why

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.015 align:middle line:84%
it's like that, and where
we need to go to change it.

00:22:02.015 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.620 align:middle line:84%
This theory that
you came up with,

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
was it one of those
aha moments for you?

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: It was a very, very
long string of aha moments.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.120 align:middle line:84%
It started with Monroe
at Monroe Laboratories.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:90%
I was the physicist there.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:90%
I worked with Dennis Mennerich.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:84%
He was a EE there,
and we were Bob's lab.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
We made the lab, and we were
the Guinea pigs in the lab.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it all.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Yeah.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:84%
My purpose was to explain
why things happened.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, the physicist,
the theoretician.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Dennis was to help
design the equipment

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:90%
and also work with me.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But I started doing research
there, and experiments there.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, I
thought I understood

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:90%
how consciousness worked.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Then I got the aha moment that
understanding consciousness

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:84%
gave me an understanding
of physics.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So that model just came
together over 35 to 40 years

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:84%
of research, and it was
based on my experience.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:84%
When I was working
in the non-physical,

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:84%
in the out-of-body state
doing research there,

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:90%
I came up with a set of facts.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Things that I knew
were true, for me.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.750 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is subjective.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Facts in the world
of consciousness.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I also am a physicist,
so I had a set of facts

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:84%
in the objective world as
well that I understood,

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to create a
single, overarching theory that

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:90%
explained all of those facts.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:84%
The facts that I had developed
in the 30 years of out-of-body

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and doing research
in consciousness,

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and all the facts I
knew as a physicist.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:90%
So that's how the model came.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's a big toe,
because it's not a little toe

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:90%
like Einstein worked on.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:84%
That would just be
the objective world.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the objective and
the subjective world.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much of this is a
product of one's imagination?

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Or it's the real deal?

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Well, that
is an excellent question.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.220 align:middle line:84%
You see, when you're in
the subjective world,

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:84%
you get information
from several sources.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.110 align:middle line:84%
One of those is
your imagination.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:90%
We're consciousness.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.750 align:middle line:84%
We get to make up
information as well.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
The other is the larger
conscious system,

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.970 align:middle line:84%
or it could be from some
other consciousness,

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
netted in consciousness.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.590 align:middle line:90%
All conscious beings are netted.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So you never really
know for sure

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.470 align:middle line:84%
which one of those three
paths your information

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:90%
is coming from.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Information defines the reality.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:90%
It could be from any of those.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:84%
The only way to tell is
with a lot of experience.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And you need to find things
in the consciousness world

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
that you can then verify
in the physical world.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, things
like remote viewing.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Like healing.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.860 align:middle line:84%
All of the paranormal
things that people do.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Precognitive dreams.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able
to do enough of this

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.190 align:middle line:84%
to convince yourself that
what you're getting is real.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not just something
that's in your imagination.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
attach to anything real.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we spent a decade
at Monroe Laboratories doing.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:84%
We spent almost all
of our time doing

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:90%
things that were evidential.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Things that you could
then look up later and say

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.210 align:middle line:84%
does this information I got
correspond with the information

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:90%
that I know that's here?

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you uncover
things that you didn't expect?

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: I uncovered lots
of things I didn't expect.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:90%
One of them was that when--

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:36.137 align:middle line:84%
as a physicist, and as
particularly a young guy,

00:25:36.137 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I was in my 20s when
all this started.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez, you were a baby.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.032 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: I was a baby, yeah.

00:25:40.032 --> 00:25:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I first went out to Monroe
Laboratory working with him

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.550 align:middle line:90%
and I was like 28?

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.775 align:middle line:90%
27, 28 years old.

00:25:46.775 --> 00:25:48.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you, though.

00:25:48.025 --> 00:25:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: So I had
this idea that religion

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:90%
was mostly nonsense.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:84%
That it was mostly made
out of fearful people who

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.550 align:middle line:84%
were looking for
answers to big questions

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.350 align:middle line:90%
that didn't have answers.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:90%
And I discounted it.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:90%
I was arrogant.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, most young
physicists in their 20s

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:90%
are pretty arrogant.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:90%
So I had this arrogant attitude.

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So I thought that
religion was mostly

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.710 align:middle line:90%
nonsense and a lot of belief.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And then one of my big
things that I didn't expect

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
was that most of what I
learned about consciousness

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of
reality was stuff

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that people had known
for the last 5,000 years.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the Buddha said
that reality was an illusion.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, he didn't use the
words virtual reality,

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.680 align:middle line:90%
but it fits perfectly.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And sages, and people who
have explored inner space

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.050 align:middle line:84%
come to all the same
conclusions that I

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:84%
came to as a physicist doing
research in the nonphysical.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
It all boiled down to
pretty much the same thing.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that
religion, for the most part,

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.410 align:middle line:90%
was based on fundamental truths.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.850 align:middle line:90%
That is the way it is.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the way the world works.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But there's also lots
of dogma, and creeds,

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and my god's better than
your god sort of thing.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
nonsense involved in it,

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.660 align:middle line:84%
but the fundamentals,
the basic ideas

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
that are common
to most religions,

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:90%
are fundamental truth.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:90%
That is the way it is.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, what exactly
is quantum mechanics?

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Well, quantum
mechanics was actually

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.230 align:middle line:84%
created because
of one experiment,

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
double-slit experiment.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And quantum mechanics
was invented

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.080 align:middle line:84%
to explain the results
of this experiment.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And in this
experiment, the results

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
were such that they
defied materialism.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.710 align:middle line:90%
They defied Newtonian mechanics.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So Einstein came
to the conclusion,

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.780 align:middle line:84%
actually got a Nobel Prize for
it, that light was a particle.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And we had known, scientists
had known for almost 100 years,

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.690 align:middle line:90%
that light was a wave.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So now there was
this discrepancy,

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.070 align:middle line:84%
because particles and waves
don't act the same way.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:12.810 align:middle line:10%
So the scientists at that time,
now this is like 1915 to 1925,

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.410 align:middle line:10%
that decade is when
most of this took place,

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:20.880 align:middle line:10%
they found a way to
take light particles,

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:25.200 align:middle line:10%
photons, and send
them at a barrier that

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.120 align:middle line:10%
had two slits cut in it.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:10%
Because they knew that if
they shined a coherent light

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.940 align:middle line:10%
on those two slits,
they would get what's

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.590 align:middle line:10%
called a diffraction pattern.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.540 align:middle line:10%
There'd be places where
there was no light,

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:10%
and other places
where there was light,

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:10%
because light would go
through both the slits,

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:10%
interfere with itself, and
make this diffraction pattern.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they put
particles through there,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.890 align:middle line:84%
particles are just supposed
to go through a slit

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and then hit the
screen behind the slit,

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.715 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what particles do.

00:28:53.715 --> 00:28:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But not this time.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: But not this time.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.730 align:middle line:84%
This time, when they just
sent the particles through one

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.600 align:middle line:84%
at a time, those particles
rearranged themselves

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:84%
in the same diffraction pattern
that a light wave would make.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, to find out really
what was going on at those two

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:16.830 align:middle line:84%
slits, they put detectors
there so they could tell when

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.870 align:middle line:90%
a photon went through a slit.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
that, the photons just

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
piled up behind the slits
like a good particle

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.660 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to do.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So now they had this problem of
when they looked at the data,

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.670 align:middle line:84%
at the slit, they got
particle pattern, if you will.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Piles of particles.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And when they didn't, they got
a wave, which was the same as--

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:84%
which produced a
diffraction pattern.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So there was no way to
explain that, because you

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.610 align:middle line:84%
see these particles, Newton
told us, were supposed

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to travel in a straight
line unless acted upon

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.910 align:middle line:90%
by an external force.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.170 align:middle line:90%
It's like Newton's second law.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.520 align:middle line:84%
That's so long ago, I'm
not sure I got that right,

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.180 align:middle line:90%
but it's one of Newton's.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.222 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were there
with Newton, weren't you?

00:30:02.222 --> 00:30:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Almost.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.900 align:middle line:90%
It was one of Newton's laws.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And anyhow, that's not
what was happening.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:84%
There were no external
forces on these particles,

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.330 align:middle line:84%
but yet they weren't
traveling in a straight line.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:84%
They were rearranging themselves
in this very particular wave

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:17.880 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So quantum mechanics was
born to answer that question.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.090 align:middle line:90%
How can we understand this?

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And what they decided was that
there really were no particles.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.350 align:middle line:90%
There's only probable particles.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.930 align:middle line:84%
A particle might be
somewhere and might not.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So particles only
existed as probability.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they weren't sure.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Yeah.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.412 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're saying that
there are no particles.

00:30:40.412 --> 00:30:41.860 align:middle line:90%
There's just probability.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the
probability of where

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.730 align:middle line:84%
these particles go,
then we can do the math,

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and look at the
probability function,

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and we get this
diffraction pattern.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So that was where quantum
mechanics was born.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And then of course in
the next 100 years,

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.400 align:middle line:84%
it was about 100
years ago, they got

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:84%
more and more sophisticated,
and quantum mechanics

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.570 align:middle line:84%
grew and developed,
and now it's one

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:84%
of our most productive, most
successful theories ever,

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:84%
because it's almost
always right.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.343 align:middle line:90%
It makes the right predictions.

00:31:13.343 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, you
produced a video

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:84%
on how you believe we
can change the world.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: If you'd
like to change the world,

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:27.000 align:middle line:84%
if you're tired of all of the
greed and abuse, people using

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.890 align:middle line:84%
people, corporations using their
customers, and their suppliers,

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else to
accumulate more and more wealth.

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
If you really don't like
the self-centeredness

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and the nastiness that we
find here instead of the love,

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and peace, and caring that
we'd like to find here,

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:84%
well, the way you go
about changing the world

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.900 align:middle line:90%
is by changing yourself.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.700 align:middle line:84%
All the negative
things that you see

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:84%
going on in the world that are
upsetting to you are symptoms.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:07.530 align:middle line:84%
They're symptoms of a low
quality of consciousness.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:84%
They're symptoms of a high
entropy consciousness.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:10%
Once we understand that
this is a virtual reality,

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.080 align:middle line:10%
once these experiments
are done and help

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:10%
verify that this is a virtual
reality, once we as a people,

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.830 align:middle line:10%
or as a race,
understand our purpose

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:27.330 align:middle line:10%
as consciousness is to grow
up and evolve our quality,

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.640 align:middle line:10%
then people will
begin to change.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And as people change,
these symptoms

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:38.490 align:middle line:84%
of low quality of consciousness
will change all by themselves.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:84%
You see, it's the
quality of consciousness

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:42.070 align:middle line:90%
that's the problem.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:10%
Not the dictator, not
the president and CEO

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.540 align:middle line:10%
of the corporation that's
abusing people, not

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:10%
the politicians.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Those are symptoms
of the problem.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.730 align:middle line:84%
The problem is low
quality of consciousness.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Doing these experiments, showing
that this is a virtual reality,

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.570 align:middle line:84%
understanding what that
means in terms of who we are,

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and what's important and what's
not in terms of growing up

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:10.200 align:middle line:90%
and decreasing our entropy.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.690 align:middle line:10%
Increasing the quality
of our consciousness.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Becoming love.

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Caring about other people.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.150 align:middle line:84%
This is what will
change the world.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:84%
If we want to live in a
kinder, gentler world,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:26.663 align:middle line:84%
we have to change
ourselves first.

00:33:26.663 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love that picture
of those politicians punching

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.550 align:middle line:90%
each other out.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Must've been an
emotional meeting.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Can we change ourselves,
or is this something

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.717 align:middle line:90%
that is built within us?

00:33:39.717 --> 00:33:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Oh, of course
we can change ourselves.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.240 align:middle line:90%
We can grow up.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.920 align:middle line:90%
We can become more.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And how we do that is by
letting go of our fear.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Fear is the problem.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.287 align:middle line:90%
As we let go of fear--

00:33:52.287 --> 00:33:53.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The unknown
as part of the fear.

00:33:53.995 --> 00:33:55.912 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Yeah, The
unknown is part of fear.

00:33:55.912 --> 00:33:57.310 align:middle line:90%
People fear the unknown.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:84%
That's part of their fear
of death, and part of that's

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:90%
a fear of the unknown.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
But they fear all sorts
of personal things, too.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.140 align:middle line:84%
They fear that they
are inadequate,

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.750 align:middle line:84%
that they're not good enough,
that they are unlovable,

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:11.290 align:middle line:84%
that they need to pretend
to be somebody else in order

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:12.760 align:middle line:90%
to be liked.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.179 align:middle line:84%
So they live in an image
rather than being authentic.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have lots
of, lots of fears,

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and those fears
inform our choices.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And we need to, basically,
take ourselves back,

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.290 align:middle line:90%
if you will, from those fears.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:30.639 align:middle line:84%
And as we get rid of the fear,
life becomes more about others

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:31.929 align:middle line:90%
and less about us.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Fear is very self-referential.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Why does it seem that
when you're born,

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and we develop these
different traits,

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.900 align:middle line:84%
that nobody teaches
us this, what

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.520 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about today?

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that we
just inherit and pick up?

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.949 align:middle line:84%
Is it part of our
genetic makeup?

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Or do we really learn it
from outside exposure?

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: Well, the reason
that it's so hard to teach

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:84%
is you can't teach
somebody how to grow up.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.297 align:middle line:84%
You can't teach
somebody how to be.

00:35:04.297 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or to love.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Yeah, or to love.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Those things are hard to teach.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:09.990 align:middle line:90%
It's something that you are.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a matter of being.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:90%
So you have to change yourself.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else can come
in and change you.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.350 align:middle line:90%
You can't change anyone else.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:84%
You make choices, and
you do end up growing up,

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:26.300 align:middle line:84%
one way or another, more or
less based on those choices

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and the quality
of those choices.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So if those choices are
about caring, and love,

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's about other,
not about self,

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.720 align:middle line:84%
then you grow up
very positively.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.150 align:middle line:84%
If the choices are poor
choices, you don't grow up.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.460 align:middle line:90%
You stay full of fear.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Unhappy, miserable.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you
concluded, Tom, about humanity?

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:46.980 align:middle line:90%
What direction are we headed?

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMPBELL: I think that
there's a good chance

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that in the next two, or
three, or four decades,

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:57.260 align:middle line:84%
humanity will take
a giant step forward

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:90%
in this evolutionary game.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Yes.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that
is, for the first time

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:10.610 align:middle line:84%
in the history of humanity, all
the pieces are in place for us

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:13.290 align:middle line:90%
to take a big step forward.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've been
evolving all along,

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and we've had people
like the Buddha

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:84%
who understood, you know,
what life was about.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And not just the Buddha,
but religions in general.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And we've had that,
but it's always

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:84%
been limited in
sort of the margins.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:90%
It's there, but it's margins.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, we have
the infrastructure

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.660 align:middle line:84%
called the internet
that lets us communicate

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.700 align:middle line:90%
worldwide very, very quickly.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So now, these little kind
of bubbles of enlightenment

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:48.020 align:middle line:84%
that have always been
there can coalesce.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Also, we have an ability
to create empathy

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.350 align:middle line:84%
with people other than just
our family and our neighbors.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, it used to be that
somebody said, oh, 1,000 people

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.818 align:middle line:84%
were killed in a
tsunami or a hurricane

00:37:03.818 --> 00:37:05.110 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the world.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.150 align:middle line:84%
People would go, oh,
yeah, gee, too bad.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But they wouldn't
connect to that.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:10.767 align:middle line:84%
Now, we get to see them
up close and personal.

00:37:10.767 --> 00:37:12.058 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like we're there.

00:37:12.058 --> 00:37:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Like we're there.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:17.080 align:middle line:84%
That is enlarging our
viewpoint, enlarging our world.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So as we grow, the
world tends to shrink.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.440 align:middle line:90%
We see the humanity in others.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.290 align:middle line:84%
We see eyeball to eyeball the
things that people are doing.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:84%
We have a better sense
of the kind of reality

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.350 align:middle line:90%
we're living in.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't find
that to be a very good thing.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.480 align:middle line:84%
They see that this
world is full of fear.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.910 align:middle line:90%
It's full of nastiness.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:40.940 align:middle line:90%
It's full of greed.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:84%
It's full of people
out for themselves.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:47.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, how can I use
you, and what can I take?

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think most of us
feel like that's not good.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:52.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not optimal.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
where we need to be.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But it won't get
into the mainstream

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:84%
until the mainstream, which
now it's the scientists--

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I call the scientists the high
priests of Western culture.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:09.280 align:middle line:84%
The high priest's job was to
tell the people what was true

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.840 align:middle line:90%
and what to believe.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And if the high priests of
Western culture say yea verily,

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:17.740 align:middle line:84%
this is a virtual
reality, then that

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:22.240 align:middle line:84%
will start a ball rolling
that logically, will start out

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.760 align:middle line:84%
as this reality is
information-based to love

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.960 align:middle line:90%
is the answer.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.990 align:middle line:84%
There is a logical connection
from one of those to the other.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Take us probably more
time than we have here

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:39.910 align:middle line:84%
to go through that, but if that
happens, and the high priests

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:44.410 align:middle line:84%
put us into the mainstream with
that concept of what we're here

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to do is grow up,
become love, then

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:52.150 align:middle line:84%
people who are fed up
with greed and avarice

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.730 align:middle line:90%
will begin to see a better way.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:84%
This idea of a virtual
reality, this idea

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:84%
that I have in "My Big
Toe," it's very inclusive.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can be a part of it.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
you have to believe.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact, I say
belief is a problem.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Ego and belief are problems.

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Always be skeptical.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
that opposites

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.330 align:middle line:90%
can find their self in.

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:18.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
you're an atheist,

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:20.800 align:middle line:84%
you can look at the "My
Big Toe" and you can say,

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.990 align:middle line:90%
ah, knew it all along.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:26.320 align:middle line:84%
There's no God, but there's
this larger consciousness system

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that does all the things
that people in religion

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:30.820 align:middle line:90%
say that God does.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you are a theist, you can
say, ah, I knew it all along.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
This larger
consciousness system.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.090 align:middle line:90%
That's God.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So people from all sides
can find a logical structure

00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.860 align:middle line:84%
that they can hang
their own experience on.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happens, I think we'll

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:52.120 align:middle line:84%
have some bigger steps made
as far as our growing up goes.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we don't, if we
don't accept it, if we don't

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.310 align:middle line:90%
learn it, what happens to us?

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: We get to try again.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:03.130 align:middle line:84%
We get to keep trying
and keep working on it

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:04.232 align:middle line:90%
until we do get it.

00:40:04.232 --> 00:40:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we get that
second or third chance?

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Yes.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And we will get as many
chances as we need,

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.980 align:middle line:84%
because what we're talking
about is evolution.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the evolution
of consciousness

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:17.470 align:middle line:84%
toward lower entropy states,
toward becoming love.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And evolution may be very slow,
but evolution is relentless.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:10%
Evolution just keeps
the pressure up, just

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.240 align:middle line:10%
keeps pushing until it succeeds.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.780 align:middle line:10%
That's the nature of evolution.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:10%
We evolve into those states
that are more profitable.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:10%
And being kind, and
considerate, and caring

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.687 align:middle line:10%
makes a more profitable
social system.

00:40:42.687 --> 00:40:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.303 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMPBELL: Thank you.

00:40:46.303 --> 00:40:48.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: He was a
20-something-year-old person

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:51.070 align:middle line:10%
working with Robert Monroe
at the Monroe Institute

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:54.610 align:middle line:10%
and learned about consciousness,
out-of-body experiences,

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.680 align:middle line:10%
and has learned one major thing.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.470 align:middle line:84%
That humanity can
change for the better.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:09.000 align:middle line:90%
