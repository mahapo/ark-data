00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:20.670 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.400 align:middle line:10%
We've got an amazing
story for you tonight.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle line:10%
As a teenager, Jason
Shurka endured--

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:10%
get this-- 23 shoulder
dislocations, three surgeries,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:10%
and a near leg amputation.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Drawing on the fundamental
laws of creation,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:84%
he transformed his life and now
inspires others to do the same.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:10%
Founder of UNIFYD TV and
Unified Healing, his latest book

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:10%
is called Accessing Awareness.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Jason, welcome back
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:84%
JASON SHURKA: Thank
you very much, George.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.117 align:middle line:90%
It's great to see you again.

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:57.840 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: 23 shoulder separations?

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.475 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: It was a lot.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.940 align:middle line:90%
It started when I was 14.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It happened between 14
and 18, 19 years old.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:90%
So about four to five years.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Did you have an
accident or anything?

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: No.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:10%
The first time, I went
to reach for something,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:10%
it spontaneously popped out.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:10%
Never stopped, and it just
kept getting worse and worse.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it would
happen in my sleep.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Does it still happen?

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: No.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.550 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: What happened
to make it stop?

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:10%
SHURKA: Well, if
you ask the doctors,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:10%
they'll tell you surgery.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:10%
But once wasn't enough.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:10%
Twice wasn't enough.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:10%
The third one, I guess, was.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, I see things
from a different perspective.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I believe that everything
happens for us, and not to us.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn the
lesson that something's

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
trying to teach
you, it doesn't have

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:90%
to come back your way again.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's my way of seeing it.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
The doctors may disagree,
but I understood over time--

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still understanding--
but I understood

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:90%
what it was trying to show me.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:90%
I acknowledged the lessons.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And why does it
have to happen again

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
if you already got the gift
it was trying to give you?

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Can you move your
arm without much pain?

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Very much so.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.563 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Look at you.

00:02:04.563 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:90%
You're doing better than me.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, good for you.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.980 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Thank you.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.350 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: But this set you on
a spiritual path, didn't it?

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.150 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.325 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Tell me about that.

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: So you brought
up the leg amputation.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.790 align:middle line:84%
That's a big one because
that was the cherry on top.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:90%
So 14 years old, it started.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:90%
15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
On my 19th birthday, I was
in the hospital with a staph

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:90%
infection in my left leg.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole long
story in and of itself,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
but I lost 25% of
my body weight.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: God.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: 19th birthday was there,
in dire need of as much support

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:90%
And it almost killed me.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just a leg amputation.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
I was about 24 hours away
from that hitting my blood

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:90%
and it completely taking me out.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Almost like sepsis,
for crying out loud.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: It was very, very bad.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So it was throughout that time
that really got me thinking.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time in my
life where I was laying down,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have
a phone to look at,

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't have a TV to watch.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
time where I woke up

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and I actually heard my
heartbeat for the first time.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Not just felt it,
but I heard it.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the
spaces in between.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:84%
The moments of silence
and stillness in between.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And it got me thinking, where
does all of this come from?

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Where does all action,
where does all life actually

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:90%
emerge from?

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And it really is in those
moments of presence,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:90%
and those moments of stillness.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So that cherry on top was what
got me to start seeing things

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And it just started downloading
into me like a machine.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started reading,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.407 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I
started writing.

00:03:46.407 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How many books
did you start reading?

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: A lot.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So up until 19, I never
read a book in my life.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why was because I
was like a normal kid in school,

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want to be
the weird one or the nerd,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:90%
so I just kind of fit in.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Although, I was very
interested in things,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.873 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't want people to
look at me different because--

00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: You didn't want them to
know what you were doing, right?

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah, kind of.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of sat there,
and for a long time,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I hid my true self
because I didn't

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
want to be looked at in
a weird way in school.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:84%
But 19, I picked
up my first book.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.110 align:middle line:84%
It was called The
One Minute Cure--

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.920 align:middle line:90%
all about hydrogen peroxide.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
It took me two or
three hours to read.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And the second one was
called Energy Medicine.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting into these
medical-but-spiritual aspects

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:90%
of learning things.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Holistic.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Yeah,
holistic alternative.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And it brought me down this path
where it became this obsession.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I read like 40, 42
books that year,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:90%
and it started a beautiful path.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: That's more books than
most people read in a lifetime.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: But it wasn't just
reading, it was studying.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:84%
You see, if you go back
to those books on my shelf

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and you open them, it's
highlighting, it's taking notes,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:90%
it's studying.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
That's how you become
the information,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:90%
not just learn the information.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.365 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Who have you learned
from in terms of teachers?

00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Quite honestly,
the people that

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:90%
hurt me the most in my life.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Oh, really?

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not just me.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.972 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Without giving us names,
what kind of people hurt you?

00:05:17.972 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: People that
stab you in the back.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
This is for everybody,
not just myself.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Friends.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Friends, family
members, business partners.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:90%
I truly, truly believe--

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
as hard as it may be-- going
through those tough experiences,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
those are the experiences
where you learn the most.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the experiences where
you gain the most, where

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:90%
you get the strongest.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And although they're hard, if we
can find a way to embrace them,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
you become a completely
different and more evolved

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.340 align:middle line:90%
person throughout those people.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, it's the
worst people in your life

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:84%
that are really giving
you the greatest lessons.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: You trusted
them, didn't you?

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.490 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Big time.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.910 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How many times
did they hurt you?

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Well,
quite a few people.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
They didn't hurt
me, they helped me.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have to clear that
up because it wasn't--

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:84%
yes, on the surface, it's
individuals hurting you.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'd encourage
everybody that's

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.745 align:middle line:84%
watching this right now, think
of those individuals that

00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:90%
have hurt you in your life.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Think of those individuals
that you've been wronged by,

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and try to understand what
they've actually taught you

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.410 align:middle line:90%
through that process.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, on the
surface, they hurt me.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.027 align:middle line:84%
But at the core of it
all, they're my guides.

00:06:34.027 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:90%
They're my teachers.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Do you deal
with them still?

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Some.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.265 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Have you forgiven them?

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Working on it.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.222 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: That's the hardest part.

00:06:43.222 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: But it's the
most important part.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And I say "working
on it" and not "yes"

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a human being
like everybody else.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's important
for us to relate to each other,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:84%
where you could be the greatest
guru and teacher out there.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:84%
We're all here to
learned something new.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
We're all here to go
through experiences.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Did you teach
yourself, Jason?

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Or did these events teach you?

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: That's a
beautiful question.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, every event,
every experience

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to
teach us something,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
but it's you as the
individual to make the choice,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
through your own free
will, to be open enough

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:90%
to see it in that way.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.075 align:middle line:84%
So all the things that
happened to me in my life,

00:07:26.075 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and all the things that
happened to all of us

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
throughout our lives, have
the ability to teach us.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:84%
It was that moment
in my life that

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
happened where I decided
to open up and say, OK,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.860 align:middle line:90%
what are you trying to show me?

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So I would say it's a
combination of both.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much
that I taught myself.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It's that I was open
to the teachings that

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:45.990 align:middle line:90%
were in front of me all along.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Tell us about the
fundamental laws of creation.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: So I'll go to Greek
mythology, Greek teachers,

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.265 align:middle line:90%
ancient teachers.

00:07:59.265 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: We're
going way back now.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a teacher, a
philosopher, named Parmenides.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Parmenides is famous for writing
two poems, The Way of Truth

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:90%
and The Way of Opinion.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:84%
The Way of Opinion
is what most of us

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.180 align:middle line:84%
live according to
today as human beings--

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.410 align:middle line:90%
meaning, duality.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:90%
This and that, good and bad.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:84%
The Way of Truth
is what Parmenides

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
would say the gods
live according to,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:90%
which is singularity, oneness.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:84%
Those are two completely
different worlds.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.912 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: You have learned
a lot, my friend.

00:08:38.912 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: They're actually
very short poems

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.287 align:middle line:84%
that you can study
yourself, but they're

00:08:42.287 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:84%
profound in terms
of what they teach.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So these laws of creation
that we're talking about here

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:84%
is based on his work,
many other people's work.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not original to me
in any way whatsoever,

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.620 align:middle line:84%
but I kind put my
own twist on it

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and said, OK, how can we not
just know this, but apply this

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.085 align:middle line:90%
and live according to it?

00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, am I perfect and
applied every single day?

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm a human being.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But has it changed
over time in proportion

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
of being able to make
that second nature?

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:90%
So the base law--

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
the most important law,
they're all really important--

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
but the starting one is
the law of conservation

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.040 align:middle line:84%
of energy, the first
law of thermodynamics.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Energy cannot be
created or destroyed.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you understand how
profound that is when you

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.960 align:middle line:90%
think about what that means?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It is profound.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Death is an illusion.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:84%
There is no birth and
death, according to that.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Because me and you
are made up of energy.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, we all know this.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But when you take that and
you take it a step deeper,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
let's understand
reality for a second.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference between
a reality where you're happy

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:90%
and a reality where you're sad?

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They're both something
you experience.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:84%
The difference is no different
than a radio of how you tune

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.500 align:middle line:90%
to one frequency over another.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: They're
both huge emotions.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: They're both energies.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:90%
They're both frequencies.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
The difference between joy
and sadness is a frequency.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It's made of the same energy
expressed in a different way.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you take the law
of conservation of energy,

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:84%
energy cannot be
created or destroyed.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.940 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
infinite realities

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.965 align:middle line:90%
exist right here, right now.

00:10:25.965 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But then, when you merge that
with the law of vibration--

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
which is how
walkie-talkies work--

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:84%
you experience what
you're in resonance with.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:84%
That means that if
you choose to tune

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
to one vibration
over another, and you

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
have an infinite
potential in front of you,

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:84%
you will experience one life
or one reality over another.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's just philosophy.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
how do we apply it?

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.920 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Have these laws changed
your direction, your path?

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: What changed my
direction is not just

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge of the laws, it's
the application of the laws.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, everybody watching
this right now,

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.440 align:middle line:84%
especially people on
this platform, on Gaia,

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:90%
already know all of this.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.660 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what
can we do to actually

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
apply it into our own lives,
to make it second nature?

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.080 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: And make it work.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Exactly.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Moving it from the head
to not just the heart,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:90%
but to your being as a whole.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:90%
That's really the goal here.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And the more you apply
them every single day,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:84%
the more you remind yourself
to apply them every single day,

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the more it does
become second nature.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
dive into that,

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.328 align:middle line:90%
I'm more than happy to do so.

00:11:34.328 --> 00:11:35.870 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: You've
written several books.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:84%
The latest is
Accessing Awareness.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.523 align:middle line:10%
Tell us about that one.

00:11:39.523 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:10%
SHURKA: Exactly about what
we're talking about here.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:10%
So it's all about the
knowledge with application

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:10%
because knowledge
without application

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:10%
is not really worth
much because--

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:10%
OK, so I know something.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
But are you doing something
with what you know?

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
It's great to know that
conscious speech exists,

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.840 align:middle line:84%
but are you practicing
that conscious speech?

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of the words
that will hold you back?

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of the words
that will propel you forward?

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you mix knowledge
awareness with application,

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
you really do become
superhuman in many ways.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.890 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It works for you.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.800 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: It works for everybody.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.807 align:middle line:90%
It does, it does.

00:12:17.807 --> 00:12:18.640 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Source code.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: So it goes back
to understanding reality.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very big topic,
so I'll try to make it simple.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:84%
But this actually is what
changed my life the most.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give an
analogy for a second.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: OK.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: A computer, when
you're using a computer

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and you go on to Gaia.com,
Gaia.com doesn't exist

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.460 align:middle line:90%
in the way that we see it.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:84%
When we go on it, we see it
as videos, and thumbnails,

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and comments, and
all these things.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.910 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what Gaia.com is.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Gaia.com is made
of a source code

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.090 align:middle line:84%
because Gaia has programmers
to make that source code work.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:90%
They write that code.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:84%
There are different
languages, of course.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
There's C+, C++, Cobra, all
these different languages.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the job of the computer
is to take that source code

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and, through its
components, whether it's

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
hard drive, and RAM, and
processor, and all these things,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
to take that source code,
decode it, and then project it

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:90%
as Gaia.com on your screen.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, that means that Gaia.com
is not what we think it is.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Not what the eye sees, but what
the source code actually is.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And with that same analogy,
we are no different.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:90%
We are those computers.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
We have a brain, we have eyes,
we have ears, we have senses.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to see,
to feel, to smell, to touch.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
this thing called

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:84%
source code, which is just
creation and existence made up

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The job of our brains, the job
of our consciousness-- this

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
is the mechanism
of consciousness--

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.300 align:middle line:84%
is through our
different components

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:84%
the brain, the eyes,
the ears, the nose,

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and so on and so forth,
to take that source

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.800 align:middle line:84%
code light to decode it, and
then to project it as sound,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
to project it as vision, to
project it as smell and taste

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.090 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, we are
creating our own reality,

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:90%
quite literally.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Because although you have
eyes and I have eyes,

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:84%
you may be able to
see somebody's aura,

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and I may not be able
to see somebody's aura,

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:84%
because your decoding mechanism
may be a little bit more

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.360 align:middle line:90%
advanced than mine.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.315 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Why can't
you see them, though?

00:14:45.315 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: See the aura?

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Yeah.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Take a computer.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Apple has different computers.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.820 align:middle line:90%
They have the M1 chip.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:90%
They have the M2 chip.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle line:90%
They have the M4 chip.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:90%
They have the M4 Pro Max chip.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
We work the same way,
only in a spiritual way.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So although we have the same
components, your processing

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
power, based on your awareness,
based on your ability

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
to perceive and
be aware, this is

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:84%
directly correlated to
your vibration of being.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:84%
The higher your vibration
of being, the faster

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to
process, the more

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to feel,
see, and experience.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's why individuals who
go on more spiritual journeys

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
are able to feel things in ways
that other individuals may not.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Or if you take the difference
between human beings and even

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.660 align:middle line:90%
birds.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Birds and animals
are able to detect

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.320 align:middle line:84%
a hurricane or an earthquake
before it happens.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:84%
Humans used to be able
to, and some still are.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:84%
But because we
stand on fake floor,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.560 align:middle line:84%
that fake ground
that we call shoes,

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and we sleep on fake
ground that we call beds,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and we do all these things
that are no longer in alignment

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
with natural law
and natural living.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Not in sync.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: We're not in
sync with everything,

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
with the resonance of
this planet anymore.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to process
is actually diminished,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, our
mechanism of consciousness

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:90%
has actually slowed down.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
you can't regain it.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Regaining it means
purifying your components,

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:84%
allowing more light to
come into your components,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:84%
bringing more oxygen
into your components,

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.640 align:middle line:90%
allowing them to work better.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:84%
The more you can do that, the
more you'll be able to see.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.907 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Did you learn
this by trial and error?

00:16:39.907 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Honestly, I
didn't learn this.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:42.750 align:middle line:90%
I remembered this one.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that somebody taught me.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that made sense to me

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:90%
as my vibration rose over time.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How can
an individual who

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.010 align:middle line:84%
may not be as tuned in
as someone like you,

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:90%
access their source code?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Well, first
of all, somebody

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:84%
like me is not tuned in compared
to where you could actually be.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.579 align:middle line:84%
If you're comparing it to
the rest of most people,

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Yes.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: And all I'll
say is exactly what I

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:90%
do throughout my life.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:90%
There are four levels--

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:90%
and this is a teaching now.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:16.610 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:84%
There are four levels
to our beingness.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:90%
There's the body.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:25.560 align:middle line:84%
There's the mind, or
the motor of the body--

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.410 align:middle line:84%
what makes your heart beat,
what makes your blood flow,

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:84%
what makes a cut turn
into a scab and heal,

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth--

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:84%
your body, your mind, your
spirit, and your soul.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Your soul being the
unidentified, no-name version

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:90%
of you.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And your spirit being
the identified light

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:90%
of that piece of your soul.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you an analogy
to understand better,

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:90%
and you'll see where I'm going.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:84%
If you have a tree, the tree
has roots, it has a trunk,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
it has branches, and it
has a canopy with leaves.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you compare
that to the body--

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.830 align:middle line:84%
the root, the mind--
the trunk, the spirit--

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:84%
the branches, and the
soul-- the canopy.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Most people that are trying
to elevate spiritually,

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.160 align:middle line:84%
want to go straight to
the top of that tree,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.080 align:middle line:84%
but forget about
the roots of it.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And if your roots
are not strong,

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and you try to climb them
up to the top of that tree,

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that tree will topple
over, and you will fail.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, what is the
most important thing

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.710 align:middle line:84%
that you can do to raise
that vibration of being

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and have a more profound
understanding of that source

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:90%
code and how it works?

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
the exact opposite

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:90%
of what most people think it is.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:84%
It does not lie in the
spiritual aspects of you

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:90%
that people think of.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.510 align:middle line:84%
It lies first and foremost
in your physical body,

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.660 align:middle line:84%
because your physical
body is the dimension that

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.620 align:middle line:90%
holds everything above it.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And until that's
clean, clear, and pure,

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
reaching those
higher levels will

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.835 align:middle line:84%
be just like climbing
on top of the tree

00:19:07.835 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:84%
with roots that are
rotten and not strong.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It does.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody ever
told you, Jason,

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:84%
that you possess
an amazing aura?

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: I appreciate that.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.360 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: I can see it when
you walked into the studio.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: I'll tell you one thing.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:30.020 align:middle line:84%
For me, and I know
many others that

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:84%
are on this path, many of
us in this community of Gaia

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual
community in general,

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
it's one thing to
think about this,

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:84%
but sharing it, like right
now, as I'm sharing it,

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:90%
I feel more of it.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.560 align:middle line:90%
It excites me more.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
thing that you can do.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:53.645 align:middle line:84%
It's not just eating clean
and thinking clean, but it's--

00:19:53.645 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
sharing and giving gives
you more to share and give.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.360 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It's radiating off you.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.987 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Yes, because that's
what happens when you give.

00:20:03.987 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
you need to take first

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:90%
in order to give more.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And no, you need to give more
in order to receive more.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:90%
It's the exact opposite.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.933 align:middle line:90%
But that's how I feel right now.

00:20:12.933 --> 00:20:14.350 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love
doing this work.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Did you ever think
you would be doing it?

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: No.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:21.810 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going to grow
up and my family's business,

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and take over the real
estate empire that they have,

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.177 align:middle line:90%
and do all that and move on.

00:20:25.177 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Aren't you
glad you did not?

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yeah.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I think
everybody has a destiny.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a destiny.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what happens,
you will reach that destiny.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy, and I'm grateful for
the way that things turn out.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.935 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a lesson
for all of us at home as well.

00:20:42.935 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:84%
When we go through
things in our lives,

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:84%
whatever you think is
going to happen may not be,

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and most probably won't be,
what's actually going to happen.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But if we can roll with
the punches and trust what

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.720 align:middle line:84%
comes our way and understand
that it happens for us and not

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to us, you literally
transition from victimhood,

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:90%
into this mastership of life.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, is it easy to be
there all the time?

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:90%
No, because in life--

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It takes work.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: It takes high
points and low points.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.635 align:middle line:90%
And low points are bad.

00:21:14.635 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Low points are where
we gain more tools,

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and high points are where
we master those tools.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But think of it
like this, George.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:84%
If I gave you a
toolbox right now,

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
new tools you've never used
before, you'd be excited.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:90%
You may be like, what do I do?

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.150 align:middle line:84%
But there is an exciting
thing because you

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:90%
can build something new.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: I'll put
them on the shelf.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: And you're going to
start using them and saying,

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:37.980 align:middle line:90%
how do I use them?

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.620 align:middle line:84%
But once you start
mastering them

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.045 align:middle line:84%
and you've done everything
you could with those tools,

00:21:44.045 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't the next logical step
to be giving a new toolbox

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.860 align:middle line:90%
with the next level?

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: You would think.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.185 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: That's how life works,
and high points and low points.

00:21:55.185 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Your low points, which
we call the bad points,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of difficult
for us to accept,

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:90%
but we're receiving new tools.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And your high points are the
point where you master them.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Everything's amazing.

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle line:90%
It's all great.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.743 align:middle line:84%
But once you do
that, you're not just

00:22:11.743 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:90%
going to stay there in life.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:84%
You need to receive
the next toolbox.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you go low again.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back up,
and you keep doing that.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a graph like this.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a graph that's positively
sloping in order to bring you

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:90%
higher every single time.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Where does the law
of oneness fit into this?

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:35.460 align:middle line:10%
SHURKA: The fact that everything
is interconnected to everything,

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:10%
and that is one of the
most important laws.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.700 align:middle line:10%
Because when we understand
that everything is connected

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:10%
to everything, and we
see through the illusion

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:10%
that I am separate than you,
because although there may

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:10%
be space between
us energetically,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.460 align:middle line:10%
we are more connected than ever.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:84%
You are just an oscillation in
this unified, energetic field

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:84%
that I experience and
perceive as George.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.850 align:middle line:84%
You are energy, and so am I.
We are part of the same field.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine, George,
if everybody actually

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.770 align:middle line:84%
not just understood that,
but embodied that and lived

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
according to that,
war would never exist.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Poverty would never
be allowed to exist.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Crime would never exist.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:84%
All of us are asking
every single day,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:84%
how do we make this
world a better place.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is much simpler
than most people think.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:84%
If we are all interconnected,
and I do my part

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
to radiate the embodiment of
the highest possible energy

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness there is, I
will naturally be impacting you

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and give you the
ability to do the same.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Do you
teach others this?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.770 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: I live by it.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And by living by it, you don't
actually have to speak about it.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of the hundredth
monkey effect, right?

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Right.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.310 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: That basically shows us,
and we see it in nature today.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:90%
An island here, an island here.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And these birds don't know
anything about these birds.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And these birds and
this population of birds

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.330 align:middle line:90%
start doing something different.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And somehow these birds that
don't know about these birds

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:84%
start doing the
same exact thing.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is
because they're

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
all tuned into
this cosmic field,

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.010 align:middle line:84%
into this unified consciousness
that they're all tuned into,

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:90%
whether they know it or not.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:90%
And we are no different.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, it just turns out to be
that right now, unfortunately,

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:84%
most of humanity is tuned in
to the collective frequency,

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:84%
the collective resonance
of war, of greed,

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:84%
of crime, and so
on and so forth.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:middle line:84%
But the more of us that choose
the opposite, the more of us

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:84%
will begin to
choose the opposite.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, teaching
about it is great,

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.310 align:middle line:84%
but living it is the best
possible thing you can do.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: People learn from that.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: They start
having spontaneous ideas

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and understandings of
how the world works

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:84%
by you doing your part,
even if you're silent.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Why don't our
leaders practice this?

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.700 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Because our leaders
are an expression of us.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:90%
We're not victims to them.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the law of oneness
and the law of reflection.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.123 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: What is the
law of vibration?

00:25:16.123 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: That you experience
what you're in resonance with.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, if we are all
tuning into a frequency of--

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.790 align:middle line:84%
or let's say on an
individual level--

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.763 align:middle line:84%
you keep thinking the
worst is going to happen.

00:25:29.763 --> 00:25:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Bad's going to happen.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:84%
By the way, we're all guilty
of this, including myself.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:84%
We just got to pull
ourselves out of it.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.983 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to constantly
think this is bad, this is bad,

00:25:37.983 --> 00:25:38.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get sick.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get sick.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.000 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Negative,
negative, negative.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.583 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Well, naturally, people
call it the law of attraction,

00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:84%
but it's really as simple as how
radios and walkie-talkie works.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Your words, your thoughts, your
beliefs, they hold frequencies.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Those frequencies will attract
the same frequencies to them.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.800 align:middle line:84%
They will resonate with
those same frequencies.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just this
idea, it's a science,

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:84%
where if you take two tuning
forks and both are tuned

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.040 align:middle line:84%
to 432 hertz, when I
hit this tuning fork,

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.660 align:middle line:84%
this tuning fork will start
vibrating because they are

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.110 align:middle line:90%
in resonance with each other.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So the law of vibration
states, once again,

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:84%
you experience what you
are in resonance with.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we are
all on this planet,

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
experiencing what we
are in resonance with.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And part of that experience
are our corrupt leaders.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How many laws are
there out there, Jason?

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Probably
an infinite number.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.610 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: I mean, the
law of reflection,

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:90%
the law of cause and effect.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.570 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Well, they all boil
down to the same exact thing.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.800 align:middle line:84%
That everything
is interconnected,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that everything is one,
and that everything is

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.780 align:middle line:90%
interdependent on each other.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: It's like a
wireless internet.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.960 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Basically.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But when you boil it
down, a lot people

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.918 align:middle line:84%
make it really,
really complicated.

00:26:59.918 --> 00:27:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to be complicated

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:84%
because there are just a few
laws that make up infinity.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And some people will say,
well, how does that make sense?

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you an analogy.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.210 align:middle line:84%
How many numbers
make up infinity.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is 10.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:90%
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.443 align:middle line:84%
Those 10 digits will
make up any number.

00:27:24.443 --> 00:27:25.360 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Go on forever.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Forever.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:84%
In that same way,
understanding reality

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to be complex.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Because I just showed you how
something finite makes something

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:90%
infinite.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:84%
In that same way, a
finite number of laws

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:84%
can teach you how
to access infinity.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:84%
That's what Accessing Awareness,
that book, is all about.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Do think and it becomes?

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you manifest
things on your own?

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.215 align:middle line:90%
Do you create them?

00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:58.030 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Well, when you
understand source code, when

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:84%
you understand the
mechanism of consciousness,

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.105 align:middle line:90%
nothing exists outside of you.

00:28:04.105 --> 00:28:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And technically, no, you're
not creating anything.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything already exists.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is
accessing infinite potential.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why that book is
called Accessing Awareness.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Because it shifts our mind.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It shifts our understanding
from a place of knowledge

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:90%
to a place of true awareness.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.432 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It's a great title.

00:28:23.432 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: We could have
said, creating awareness.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But if energy cannot be
created or destroyed,

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's already infinite, then
how can I create something?

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.690 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: You have what is called
the Seven steps of reprogramming

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:36.490 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:36.750 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yes.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:37.630 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Let's take a picture.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.088 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what we're
looking at here.

00:28:39.088 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:47.040 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: So this is teaching
you how to reprogram yourself

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.020 align:middle line:84%
because you are an
expression, or I should say,

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.885 align:middle line:84%
your life is an expression
of your mind's program.

00:28:53.885 --> 00:28:56.070 align:middle line:84%
So we first have to
understand with this

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that it is your mind's program
that makes up your life.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Do we start with
thought, belief in mind.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.080 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: So the
question is, how do we

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.710 align:middle line:84%
reprogram the mind in
order to have a better

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.735 align:middle line:90%
expression of our lives?

00:29:09.735 --> 00:29:11.850 align:middle line:84%
It starts with a thought
and belief in your mind

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.485 align:middle line:90%
as the first step.

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:84%
It goes to step two, which is
the reflection of that thought

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:90%
and belief in your mind.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So instead of just saying
words, let's give examples.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:26.830 align:middle line:84%
You may think I'm never
going to find the one.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And that thought is a
frequency from step one, which

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:84%
will reflect in step two as, I'm
not finding that person for me,

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not finding my soulmate.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.958 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening to me?

00:29:39.958 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Step three is then
going to bring you

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:84%
to analyzing the
programming of your mind

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:90%
by observing your words.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So your mind's program is
made up of three things--

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.760 align:middle line:90%
thought, belief, and words.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.540 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to say change
your thought and belief,

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.850 align:middle line:84%
but it's very easy
to say, pay attention

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:84%
to your words, which are an
expression of your thought

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.880 align:middle line:90%
and belief.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you can change your
words, which are made up

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:84%
of frequencies, you then imprint
your thoughts and beliefs

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.560 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.420 align:middle line:90%
This is down to a science.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.900 align:middle line:84%
But to be able to understand
which words, you want to change,

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.230 align:middle line:84%
in order to change
the program, you first

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:84%
have to analyze them by
observing those words.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, you begin to use
specific words according

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.470 align:middle line:84%
to specific formulas
that we can speak about,

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:90%
to reprogram your mind.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.790 align:middle line:84%
There are certain words
that will hold you back.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:36.880 align:middle line:84%
There are certain words that
will propel you forward.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.120 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
words that will

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
create a positive and productive
imprint on your minds program.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain words
that will do the exact opposite.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:52.932 align:middle line:84%
For example, words
like will, want, not.

00:30:52.932 --> 00:30:53.860 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Should.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.790 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Should.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.110 align:middle line:90%
They're problematic.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.680 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: See, I have
picked up on you already.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.485 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: They're problematic.

00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So one of the main formulas
on here of understanding which

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.530 align:middle line:84%
words to choose is based on,
what I like to call, the "I am"

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:11.940 align:middle line:84%
formula based on
the acronym S-I-P.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:18.245 align:middle line:84%
The subject you focus on, the
implication of that subject,

00:31:18.245 --> 00:31:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and are you stating that
in the present tense.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to say I am,
but I'll give you an example.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:84%
If you say, I want
to be healthy,

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.050 align:middle line:90%
or I don't want to be sick.

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're focusing on
the wrong topic already.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you've focused on
the right subject and say,

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I want to be healthy,
you're forgetting the fact

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.640 align:middle line:84%
that you already have
that in your field.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.770 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to want it.

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:49.480 align:middle line:90%
You need to access it right now.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.490 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: It's not what
God said to Moses--

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:53.330 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: I am.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.510 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most powerful
words, you can bring forth,

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:84%
but it's the principles that
we're really working on.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:84%
For example, thank you for
blessing me with health.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
use the words I am.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But thank you for
blessing me with health

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.370 align:middle line:84%
is using words to help
reprogram the mind.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that
over and over again,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.200 align:middle line:84%
you align with
different frequencies,

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that impact your thoughts and
beliefs in a different way.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So that brings you to step
five, which is your new words,

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:84%
become your new thoughts
and your new beliefs.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Your new thoughts
and your new beliefs

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:84%
become that new minds program
because it's all energy.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Your new minds program
reflects your new life,

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.130 align:middle line:90%
and it starts all over again.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:39.970 align:middle line:84%
It all comes down to you,
your thoughts, your beliefs,

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and your words are
your greatest tool.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:46.540 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Did anybody teach you
this or did you experience it?

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: I reverse
engineered what

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I did in my life that
worked by chance,

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and I understood
that it wasn't luck.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:53.620 align:middle line:90%
There was a reason.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the law of
cause and effect.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.453 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How many people
cannot do what you did?

00:32:58.453 --> 00:32:59.620 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Everybody can do it.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.420 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: You sure?

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.730 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: I'm positive.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.120 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: It's that easy?

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.620 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Nobody said it's easy.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you put your
focus on something

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.213 align:middle line:84%
and you want to get
somewhere, you will get there.

00:33:10.213 --> 00:33:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just want to make
something very clear.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.740 align:middle line:84%
You said how many
people can do it?

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:84%
The very fact that I did it
means everybody can do it.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:22.460 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Yeah, but you were under
a crisis situation, weren't you?

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yes.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.110 align:middle line:84%
But again, the
interconnectedness

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.720 align:middle line:84%
of each and every one of
us, the experiences you

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.550 align:middle line:90%
go through, teach me something.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Because the experiences
you go through

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.580 align:middle line:84%
allow you to evolve
in certain ways.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:90%
This is now the law of oneness.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Do we need
a crisis to react?

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:43.090 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: No.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:90%
But they do help.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.940 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Makes it
easier, doesn't it?

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:48.818 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: I mean, if
you're smooth sailing,

00:33:48.818 --> 00:33:50.360 align:middle line:84%
are you really going
to get stronger?

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a law
in and of itself.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.480 align:middle line:90%
You're going to the gym.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to get stronger
muscles if you're not picking up

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.550 align:middle line:90%
a weight?

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:84%
The implication on the word
crisis is a negative thing.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.140 align:middle line:90%
I call them blessings.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.640 align:middle line:84%
We just need to change
our perspective on it.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.170 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Give us
an example, Jason,

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:10.900 align:middle line:84%
of how you would utilize
this in your day to day life.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.739 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Every time something
negative happens to you

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Constantly.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:18.929 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Constantly.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.179 align:middle line:90%
You have a choice.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Not what happened
to you, but how

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.750 align:middle line:84%
do you choose to respond to
it from the perspective of,

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.500 align:middle line:90%
why is this happening for me?

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.780 align:middle line:90%
So how do I actually apply this?

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.510 align:middle line:84%
I change one word
in my sentence,

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and in the very
beginning, I used

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.969 align:middle line:84%
to put it in a reminder in my
phone every hour, every day,

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.843 align:middle line:90%
until it became second nature.

00:34:41.843 --> 00:34:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
recommend people

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.460 align:middle line:84%
do to make it become
second nature.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:90%
What is that one word?

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Instead of, why is
this happening to me?

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:56.744 align:middle line:84%
The "to" changes
to the word "for".

00:34:56.744 --> 00:34:59.285 align:middle line:90%
How is this happening for me?

00:34:59.285 --> 00:35:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening for me?

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.880 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: You turned
it into a positive.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Because
it is a positive.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Because-- back to Parmenides--

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:10.620 align:middle line:84%
the way of truth
has no opposite.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Meaning, in that world--

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.450 align:middle line:90%
the fundamental world of gods--

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.600 align:middle line:90%
there is no good and bad.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.345 align:middle line:90%
There is good.

00:35:19.345 --> 00:35:22.400 align:middle line:84%
In the world of opinion,
there is good and bad.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, some may say, but
Jason, my son died.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:30.680 align:middle line:84%
How are you saying
that's a good thing?

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.160 align:middle line:84%
How can you say that the loss
of a child is a good thing?

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.650 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I'm saying.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: No, it's not.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:40.400 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: In the world
of physicality,

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.865 align:middle line:90%
it's a horrible thing.

00:35:42.865 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:84%
But pain and suffering
are two different things.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:49.120 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to be in pain of
the negative things that

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.630 align:middle line:90%
happen in the physical world.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:56.475 align:middle line:84%
But suffering only exists when
you forget the way of truth,

00:35:56.475 --> 00:36:00.340 align:middle line:84%
because your son or your
daughter that you may have lost

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.720 align:middle line:84%
has a soul that came
here with a purpose.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know that your soul
and their soul is intertwined,

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.083 align:middle line:84%
and you know that everything
is happening for you.

00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And they came here
to teach you a lesson

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.600 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa to help you grow.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you can see it
from that perspective.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.450 align:middle line:84%
You may be in pain, but
you don't have to suffer.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:20.950 align:middle line:90%
How do you apply it?

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:24.600 align:middle line:84%
You remember every
second of every day.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything is happening
for me one way or another.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Now the question is,
where is the blessing?

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.750 align:middle line:84%
When you look for
it, you will find it.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.710 align:middle line:84%
We have two aspects
to ourselves.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.830 align:middle line:84%
We have our higher
selves, and we have our--

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.460 align:middle line:84%
us in our body
that we experience.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.540 align:middle line:84%
The higher self of yourself,
we call divine will.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.945 align:middle line:84%
You and your body,
we call free will.

00:36:48.945 --> 00:36:52.260 align:middle line:84%
They work together
constantly and the goal

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.870 align:middle line:84%
is to align both if you want
to reach the highest levels.

00:36:55.870 --> 00:37:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, the analogy that I'll share
with you is driving in a car.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, you and me
represent the divine will

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and the free will
of one individual.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:09.580 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: All right.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.350 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: You are the divine will.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.345 align:middle line:90%
I am the free will.

00:37:13.345 --> 00:37:16.135 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting in
a car right now.

00:37:16.135 --> 00:37:17.920 align:middle line:84%
You're on one side
with a steering wheel

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and brakes and gas, and I'm on
the other side with a steering

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:23.590 align:middle line:90%
wheel of brakes and gas.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And we know as the divine
will and the free will

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.120 align:middle line:90%
where we each want to go.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.650 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Same car or two cars?

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Same car.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
I'll make it simpler.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.170 align:middle line:84%
One car, two parts
of the same driver.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Divine will and free will.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Divine will knows the path and
the purpose of the higher self.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Free will does not, because
it came here to learn that.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.580 align:middle line:84%
But free will is
leading that car.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Until divine will
comes and intervenes.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So free will is driving,
driving, driving, driving.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Divine will is
there just in case.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And free will makes
a right turn, only

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.880 align:middle line:84%
to forget that on the path
in the street that they're

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.245 align:middle line:84%
driving on, there are trees
that it's about to crash into.

00:38:08.245 --> 00:38:11.325 align:middle line:84%
Divine will see that
because it can see ahead.

00:38:11.325 --> 00:38:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So it immediately jerks
the car back onto the road.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.590 align:middle line:84%
But free will doesn't
know that because it's

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.140 align:middle line:84%
unaware of what
divine will is doing.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So what happens, free
will hits its head

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:84%
against the wind,
the window, and says,

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.060 align:middle line:90%
why is this happening to me?

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.660 align:middle line:84%
But if free will was
aware of divine will,

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.030 align:middle line:84%
it would have understood
that divine will is

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:84%
doing its best to save its
life and to keep it on track.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.725 align:middle line:84%
That's what hardships
in our lives are.

00:38:40.725 --> 00:38:43.240 align:middle line:84%
It's us in the driver's
seat of free will,

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.300 align:middle line:84%
with the partition between
us not seeing divine will,

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.390 align:middle line:84%
forgetting that
everything is happening

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.290 align:middle line:90%
for us to keep us on track.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It's all about free will
realigning itself right back

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.210 align:middle line:90%
onto that road.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we may
not be aware of it,

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes we need to get
hit in order to wake up, which

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.740 align:middle line:90%
goes back to the crisis.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.360 align:middle line:90%
We call it a crisis.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.890 align:middle line:90%
We call it a bad thing.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's that very
thing that saved you

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.693 align:middle line:84%
from driving and crashing
straight into that tree that

00:39:10.693 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:90%
would have killed you.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.110 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Who can get you back
on that path of righteousness?

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:17.210 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Yourself
will always try to.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, call it divine will.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.320 align:middle line:90%
Call it divine consciousness.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Call it God.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Call it whatever you want.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what you call it.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:27.810 align:middle line:84%
You will always be brought
back onto that path,

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:32.100 align:middle line:84%
unless you continuously choose
not to go back onto that path.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.130 align:middle line:84%
At which point, if you do
that over and over again,

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.290 align:middle line:84%
you have no reason
to be here anymore.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.720 align:middle line:84%
You move on come
back, you try again.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.840 align:middle line:84%
We call that reincarnation
the evolution process.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.595 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Why would we
want to come back?

00:39:45.595 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Well, you
may not as George,

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:84%
but your soul most
definitely does,

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.810 align:middle line:84%
because the goal of
the soul is to learn.

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:54.320 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: I want to come
back as Jason Shurka.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.010 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: I want to
come back as highly

00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.760 align:middle line:90%
evolved as you possibly can.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But to do that, we need to
go through those hard times.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're not meant to
bog you down and hurt you.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.515 align:middle line:90%
They're meant to teach you.

00:40:07.515 --> 00:40:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, we get
caught up in them.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.030 align:middle line:90%
I get caught up in them.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:11.285 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:40:11.285 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But they're not there
to take you out.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.810 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How often do
you manifest things?

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.830 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: We all manifest
things all the time.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:18.990 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Constantly?

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.600 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: That's creation.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.970 align:middle line:90%
That's accession.

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.075 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
doing all the time.

00:40:24.075 --> 00:40:25.890 align:middle line:84%
How often do I do
it consciously,

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.340 align:middle line:90%
is a whole different story.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Because there's manifestation.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
conscious manifestation.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:33.340 align:middle line:90%
I do it pretty often.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Every single morning I sit
down, I meditate, I pray, I ask,

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.250 align:middle line:90%
I thank, and I move on.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.890 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: What is SIP formula.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.780 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: That is
the "I am" formula.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Subject, implication,
present tense.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.170 align:middle line:84%
The subject you focus
on must be the subject

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:52.540 align:middle line:84%
that you want to access,
want to experience.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:84%
The implication of that
subject must be not,

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.440 align:middle line:90%
will, want, or don't have.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.910 align:middle line:84%
But thank you for already
providing it to me.

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And present tense is stating
it in the present tense.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So, so long as your intention
is expressed according to that

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:13.170 align:middle line:84%
acronym, which is
that "I am" formula.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Subject, positive
focus, implication

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:19.650 align:middle line:84%
of that subject,
and present tense,

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:21.230 align:middle line:84%
it will make it a
whole lot easier

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:23.790 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
consciously manifest.

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.950 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: What is IBV formula?

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.240 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: IBV is making the "I
am" formula 10 times stronger.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Intent, belief, visualization.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Your intent must be aligned
with the "I am" formula--

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.385 align:middle line:84%
your subject, your implication,
your present tense.

00:41:40.385 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Your belief must be
undoubted because it's

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:47.190 align:middle line:84%
one thing to have a
belief and say, maybe,

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:48.780 align:middle line:84%
but it's kind of
hard, I don't know.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.988 align:middle line:84%
That's already going to
align yourself with something

00:41:50.988 --> 00:41:53.300 align:middle line:84%
you may not be able to
access, something you may not

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.390 align:middle line:90%
be able to experience.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So your belief
must be undoubted,

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and your visualization
must be crystal clear.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's a way to play
between both of those,

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.860 align:middle line:84%
because for some, it's hard to
be able to believe something,

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.080 align:middle line:84%
but it's easier to
be able to see it.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And for others, it's hard
to be able to see something,

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's easy to be
able to believe it.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.020 align:middle line:84%
If you can hone in
on one, the other one

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.880 align:middle line:90%
will be a whole lot easier.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.430 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Jason, when you
were going through these 23

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.160 align:middle line:84%
separations of your
shoulder, the three

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:29.085 align:middle line:84%
surgeries, the possible leg
amputation, did you cry?

00:42:29.085 --> 00:42:30.720 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Every day.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.550 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: What was that like?

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.540 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Horrible.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And yet amazing at the
same time, every day.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.020 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Was it a living hell?

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:38.820 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Yes.

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.090 align:middle line:90%
That brought me to heaven.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.923 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Did that get
you on the right track?

00:42:41.923 --> 00:42:44.770 align:middle line:90%


00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:45.570 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Of course.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.780 align:middle line:90%


00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.427 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Truly remarkable.

00:42:51.427 --> 00:42:54.010 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: I think there's a lesson
there for all of us to learn,

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:54.820 align:middle line:90%
which is important.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.585 align:middle line:84%
And I know that everybody
watching this right now

00:42:57.585 --> 00:43:00.990 align:middle line:84%
has something that they're
going through in their lives.

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is there to hurt you.

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if everything is
one and interconnected,

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:11.270 align:middle line:84%
oneness source will never do
anything to hurt itself, ever.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
have to ask ourselves,

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.460 align:middle line:84%
how is source trying to help
us right now in this hard time?

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.230 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: What's the
best advice, Jason,

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.620 align:middle line:84%
you could give to
somebody who is going

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:25.130 align:middle line:90%
through what you went through?

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.900 align:middle line:10%
SHURKA: I am not
special in everybody's

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.770 align:middle line:10%
gone through what I've gone
through in their own way.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:33.410 align:middle line:10%
Look for the hardest
things that have ever

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.830 align:middle line:10%
happened to you in your life.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the people that are
the hardest people for you

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.400 align:middle line:90%
to deal with in your life.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.640 align:middle line:84%
See them from a
lens of compassion.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.740 align:middle line:10%
See them from a lens
of understanding,

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.830 align:middle line:10%
even though it's
difficult to understand.

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:51.475 align:middle line:84%
And remember-- and this
is the biggest one--

00:43:51.475 --> 00:43:55.550 align:middle line:84%
never take anything
personally, ever.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:84%
If you can live according
to those very, very

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.680 align:middle line:84%
simple little things
throughout your life,

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.700 align:middle line:84%
specifically with never
taking anything personally,

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.740 align:middle line:84%
you'll see people in
a whole different way

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:10.660 align:middle line:84%
because that everybody's
just trying to do their best,

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:84%
even if it seems hard,
even if it looks bad.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is doing their best
and with love, with compassion,

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.450 align:middle line:84%
with forgiveness,
you can overcome

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:22.990 align:middle line:90%
any obstacle in the world.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.590 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: How do people find
your book Accessing Awareness?

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:29.135 align:middle line:10%
SHURKA: On Amazon, on my
website jasonshurka.com,

00:44:29.135 --> 00:44:31.450 align:middle line:10%
Accessing Awareness and
many other books as well.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:32.770 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: Stay healthy my friend.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:33.670 align:middle line:84%
SHURKA: Thank you
very much, George.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.260 align:middle line:84%
GEORGE: Thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.220 align:middle line:90%
SHURKA: Thank you for having me.

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:90%
GEORGE: I'm not kidding.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.300 align:middle line:84%
When he walked
into the studio, he

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:90%
had a glow about him, an aura.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I have this
ability to see that,

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that I haven't seen in
somebody in a long, long time.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And he brought it
to this program

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.120 align:middle line:84%
with these lessons for all of us
to learn how to get by in life.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
