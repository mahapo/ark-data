00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:20.895 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:21.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:10%
We've had many guests
on this program,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:10%
but there is one that is
very dear to my heart,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:10%
because he's not only
a friend, but he's

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:10%
been able to help us through
prophetic things that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:10%
have happened in our lives.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:90%
John Hogue.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.500 align:middle line:84%
He's a world renowned
expert on prophecy,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.680 align:middle line:84%
the occult, mysticism,
has 40 books

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:84%
that have sold over a million
copies or e-books as well.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:90%
He's working on another one.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:90%
John, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN HOGUE: Thanks for
having me on, George.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always
great talking with you.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.413 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: It's great to
see you in the flesh.

00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You know, this
expert on Nostradamus,

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:10%
I mean just get a tight
shot of John for a second,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:10%
and then put up a
picture of Nostradamus.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.713 align:middle line:10%
You guys are almost identical.

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:10%
>>HOGUE: Yes, I can
almost do the look.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, look at this.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Oh yes, the
look is like this.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.106 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're a little
better looking than he was.

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Thank you.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Give me a few more years.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But tell us a
little bit about this guy.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.397 align:middle line:90%
Why was he so prophetic?

00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:10%
>>HOGUE: You know, there were a
lot of people in the past that

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.982 align:middle line:10%
have written in
mysterious language,

00:01:23.982 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:10%
especially during
the 16th century,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:10%
when Nostradamus lived.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But he's the only one that
is a living controversy, who

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:90%
every generation has taken up--

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:90%
debunkers and believers.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And one has to wonder why.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be more
than just a something,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:84%
a charlatan hiding
behind cryptic language.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.952 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, there is in
the study of Nostradamus--

00:01:44.952 --> 00:01:47.035 align:middle line:84%
See, there's two kinds of
people with Nostradamus.

00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
There are the blind
believers, who

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.060 align:middle line:84%
just find whatever they're
looking for and say,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.370 align:middle line:90%
Nostradamus can never be wrong.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the blind debunkers

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
who make a profession out
of debunking people like me

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:90%
and Nostradamus.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And they can say Nostradamus
never gets anything right.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But what they're saying,
really, is something

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:90%
about their own projections.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And I learned early on
with studying Nostradamus

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
that one has to put one's own
biases and expectations aside.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And then what you
see is a pattern.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
You also see a man who,
under all that obscurity,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:84%
sometimes comes right out
in the light, names names,

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
says the French people
after deposing--

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He lays it right out.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: 1792, he
says, the French people

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
will depose their King and
they will create a calendar

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:90%
to mark the New Age.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
happened in 1792,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:90%
and he wrote that in 1555.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's just one example
of many I could cite.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
The other thing,
too, is Nostradamus

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:84%
is almost carried by, in
a lot of the controversy,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.490 align:middle line:84%
by just the myth and
ignorance that people

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.979 align:middle line:90%
have in the prophecies.

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the books
that are out there

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:84%
aren't even based on
the original French.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who really is
serious about Nostradamus

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:84%
needs to actually study the
16th century French and have

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
the original manuscripts
to translate from.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.282 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are an
expert, John, on prophecy.

00:03:07.282 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into some
of the prophetic things

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:90%
that you've talked about.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you
questions about our future.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:90%
But how did that happen for you?

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Did you train yourself?

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:84%
We've all got this gift,
but what happened to you?

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: I think it's born
out of an innate innocence

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
that ever since I was
a little boy and as

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
a thread throughout
my life, I never

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
had my connection
with the whole,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:90%
with the ecstatic oneness.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Completely suppressed by school,
by the education system that we

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
all pass through, where we
are-- to survive as children,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
we have to adopt our
parents', our society--

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:84%
there are identifications
with certain cultural things,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
borrowed religions,
all of that, rather

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.630 align:middle line:90%
than seek the truth ourselves.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:84%
But in some way, my
spiritual rebelliousness

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:90%
was never completely suppressed.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.305 align:middle line:84%
And so it guided me eventually
out of an opera career,

00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
out of other things I did to
this, almost like a pulling,

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:84%
like a siren's call,
back to my 12th house

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:84%
double Scorpio nature, to
go into secret alone spaces.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was always fascinated
by history and its patterns,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.599 align:middle line:84%
how history seemed
to repeat itself.

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had you on the
program, on Coast to Coast

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:90%
a number of times.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:90%
I can't count how many times.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: I've lost count.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Has it been 15 years?

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At least.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Yeah.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have talked
about presidential elections.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.770 align:middle line:84%
You have called now
the last 13 elections,

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.850 align:middle line:90%
that's 52 years of elections.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And on the last one, you
thought you were wrong.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And I pointed out to
you, wait a minute,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
the numbers are still
coming in for Hillary.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.746 align:middle line:84%
She's going to win
the popular vote

00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Which is what I do

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She won
by $2.5 million--

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:90%
2.5 million people.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she has $2.5
million, who knows?

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But you finally
realized yourself,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
you've been dealing with the
popular vote, haven't you?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: It's always
an evolution how--

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of the
objective side of studying

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
what happens-- up
until 2000, I thought

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:90%
I was calling the winner.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Period.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Period.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But even back in
2000, I was saying,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I see Al Gore winning,
absolutely, by half a million

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:84%
votes and also I calculate how
I calculated Hillary Clinton's

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:90%
percentile, too, accurately.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.914 align:middle line:84%
But I said I feel like
I'm going to be right

00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
be equally wrong.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't--
that's the message.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
didn't know why.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.687 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Explain to me, I said
to hosts and other people.

00:05:45.687 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.061 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know
what that means.

00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when you're
in the act of being

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
the vehicle of
prophecy, doesn't mean

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
you know what's hiding,
what the mysteries are.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
From my own experience, I
would say that a lot of seers

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.710 align:middle line:84%
are just saying,
this is what I saw.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
The four horses and
the things happening.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Well what does it mean?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.920 align:middle line:90%
That's for the future to unlock.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.725 align:middle line:90%
It's not about us.

00:06:12.725 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:84%
When, of course,
Gore won, and then it

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
was taken away from him by
the Supreme Court, I realized,

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:84%
oh, I've been doing
the popular vote.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So I started from that
point on doing two caveats.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.330 align:middle line:84%
I did it for Hillary
Clinton twice in 2008.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:84%
A year before she went, I wrote
an article "Hillary Clinton's

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Albatross" at hopeprophecy.com
where I basically said,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.870 align:middle line:84%
this is how she
could sabotage her--

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.450 align:middle line:84%
because she has this destiny,
where sure bet destiny,

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:90%
she blows it.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she did.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.995 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: And she did.

00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Blow it.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.824 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: And then I
was saying again, I

00:06:53.824 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
had to remind readers
who were all upset

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.825 align:middle line:90%
with me calling number 13.

00:06:56.825 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, look
at these quotes.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:90%
I said this is how.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I said that if she
did not in June,

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
before the Democratic
Convention,

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I said this is her opportunity
to actually bring those Bernie

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Sanders people in by
making him the vice

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.400 align:middle line:84%
presidential candidate, and
then show that she could bring

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
balance to the business
side of the Democratic Party

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and the popular side.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And she did that, that would
show me, as a prophecy scholar,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.552 align:middle line:90%
that she truly can lead.

00:07:22.552 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
have helped her, too.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.301 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Well, she would
have won by a landslide.

00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said
there'd be no--

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.039 align:middle line:90%
she would have won.

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:31.455 align:middle line:84%
Bernie Sanders' people would
have added another 10 million

00:07:31.455 --> 00:07:34.190 align:middle line:84%
to that and probably in
Michigan and other places.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: But I kept seeing
how she would blow it,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and then a year before the
presidential elections,

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I wrote "Trump for President,
Astrological Predictions,"

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
when it was a field of 17 people
and five in the Democrats.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said these are the
two it will be at the end.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And if Trump is at the end, he
has absolutely the best chance

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of sabotaging her a second
time because she won't

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:90%
know how to fight him properly.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:84%
She'll go negative on him, and
anybody that does that gets

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:90%
gobbled alive.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's still happening
with the US press.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:84%
It seems-- which is another
subject-- but basically

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I said that he had the
best stars of anybody

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
I saw on the 8th of
November 2016 election.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said if he's there, he has
a very good chance of winning,

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:90%
and he did.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.632 align:middle line:84%
So I was both wrong and
right in an odd way.

00:08:25.632 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I pointed
out that you were right.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: I know, and I was
ready to throw in the towel.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:84%
And I was surprised how
happy I was about it

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:90%
because it had just happened.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
We were on about 20 minutes
later, and I wasn't watching.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you reminded me that
the popular vote was still

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:84%
coming on big time
in California.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But I was surprised
to see how it

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.267 align:middle line:84%
was a load off my chest to
not keep this winning streak.

00:08:46.267 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then the next
morning, you were like,

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:90%
oh, boy.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Then I had to get
on and say, OK, the whirlwind

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.310 align:middle line:90%
is going to hit me.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we are.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.155 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: I was right again.

00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was right
again, 13 times.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:84%
You have said on the
program that had it

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
been Hillary or Donald Trump
that you don't think they're

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.900 align:middle line:90%
going to complete their term.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Yes, and
it's funny how--

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:84%
here's again how
patterns of the future--

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.505 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing, currently,
President Trump predictions,

00:09:09.505 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
which should be out
in about a month,

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and where I'm looking at this
interesting parallel, where

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the same things
that would have taken Hillary

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Clinton out of office before she
finished the second year even,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.260 align:middle line:84%
by May or so of next
year, are almost--

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:84%
with a variation on a theme
because of a different energy

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.050 align:middle line:84%
being brought, but the same
predictability window is open.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
For instance, Trump still
faces the short countdown

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:84%
of Nostradamus' processes
about a new Cold

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
War between the eagle totem
kingdoms of the north happening

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.988 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
could be happening now.

00:09:44.988 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Well, in
November, November of 2017

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
is the danger point, and
then it comes again in 2027.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that's happening is,

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Trump is facing the
same eclipse that

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
could be very
powerful to influence

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:90%
a change of the United States.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, they
both have issues

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.129 align:middle line:84%
with special interests
in their organizations.

00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:84%
In her case, it was
the Clinton Foundation,

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:84%
which was what I felt
would bring her down.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
In his case, it could
be those interests

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.694 align:middle line:84%
that are trying to co-opt
him towards their ideas.

00:10:19.694 --> 00:10:21.110 align:middle line:84%
They wanted Clinton
to be the one.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to make him.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
If he doesn't play
the game, then it's

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
possible that certain scandals
related to Trump Organization

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
will be brought up and then
you'll have an impeachment.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And I would-- I
astrologically would

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:84%
say, looking at his
astrology related

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.976 align:middle line:84%
to that eclipse in
August, that some time

00:10:36.976 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:84%
after that eclipse--
of course, they're

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
not going to-- the Congress will
be at the beach on August 21

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:84%
of 2017-- but
sometime in the autumn

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.502 align:middle line:84%
after that, that would
be the earliest that he

00:10:47.502 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:90%
would face impeachment.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That will
be interesting.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:90%
We'll watch that.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: So we'll see.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late American
prophet Edgar Cayce once

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
talked about Russia, and
he felt that Russia would

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:90%
be the hope of the new world.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:84%
It's ironic that Putin
today, by and large,

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:84%
is being looked at as
the person who's making

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:90%
things happen on this planet.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Are we getting close
to something like that?

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Yes, and in my work,
one of the most important

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
things to do is I
put aside all of

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.714 align:middle line:90%
my own political expectations.

00:11:22.714 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I qualify that
when you're on Coast to Coast.

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, I try to tell
people, he's not a Hillary fan.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.730 align:middle line:90%
He's not a Trump fan.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Not a Putin fan.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's just calling
it the way he feels it.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Well, and what I also
do on that objective side is--

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.762 align:middle line:84%
since I was eight years old
and fascinated by the news,

00:11:39.762 --> 00:11:41.345 align:middle line:84%
but I've also watched
the de-evolution

00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:45.947 align:middle line:84%
of news to the level, the
troglodyte level of it now.

00:11:45.947 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But the beautiful thing
is we live in a time

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:84%
now, where, if you work
full time at this like I do,

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I can spend the hundreds
of hours actually going

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:84%
online and actually watching
exactly full real time what

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.677 align:middle line:90%
Vladimir Putin actually said.

00:12:00.677 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:90%
Or what so-and-so actually said.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Russian.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.794 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Well, well,
Putin is very savvy

00:12:04.794 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
that way because he makes
sure that everything

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
that he has said is translated
in perfect English to Russian.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it is a testament
to Russia today

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:84%
that they have the largest
file of raw footage of world

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:90%
events of any group.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And I would wish all
of the other agencies

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:90%
would do a similar thing.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Because of course, then
people would have the chance

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:84%
to actually look at
the material and be

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:84%
their own judge before they
are told what to think.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, and
that's the problem today.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: And so with that
said, looking at Edgar Cayce's

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.629 align:middle line:84%
prophecy, he said, Russia
would be the hope of the world.

00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said it-- he started
saying it in readings

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.916 align:middle line:90%
between 1934 and 1944.

00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And in those readings,
I collected them

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
in a book called A New Cold War,
the Prophecies of Nostradamus,

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Stormberger, and Edgar
Cayce, which I actually

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.322 align:middle line:90%
previewed on your show.

00:12:52.322 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did,
and you taught me

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.085 align:middle line:84%
about Stormberger,
which if we have time,

00:12:56.085 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:90%
we'll talk about him.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.990 align:middle line:90%
That's scary.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Well, yeah, it's that
I've been waiting for this

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:84%
countdown of the
northern kings to happen,

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and then in April of 2014
when the Ukrainian civil war

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
started, and then the sanctions
and counter sanctions, I went--

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bingo.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: This is it.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.076 align:middle line:84%
I've been watching like
a hawk for-- since--

00:13:16.076 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:90%
well, since long time, 30 years.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And I never usually do
my alarm bells like this,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:84%
but what makes this
so dangerous is

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and also what's so beautiful
about it, being that Vladimir

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Putin is actually doing things.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who stopped the
attempt to start a war in Syria

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.750 align:middle line:90%
in August of 2013?

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.800 align:middle line:84%
When the Americans were
going to bomb Syria,

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:84%
he negotiated a deal
with the Syrian dictator

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.740 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of all
the chemical weapons

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, that
was a setup similar to what

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.060 align:middle line:84%
happened to Operation
Iraqi Freedom and all that.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, exactly.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: And then it is
Vladimir Putin actually

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:84%
stopped the fighting in Ukraine
not once but twice in the Minsk

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.810 align:middle line:90%
one and two agreements.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
So it is Vladimir Putin that's
redesigning the entire shift.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:84%
When the sanctions started,
the most significant thing

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that happened the same week
when the Cold War started

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
was his deal with the
Chinese, a major $300 billion

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:84%
deal to literally feed
Russian oil into China.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote about it saying
this is a core shift from what

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:90%
actually Putin calls now--

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were spot on.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: He calls the end of
the Western centric world,

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:90%
the post-Western centric world.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, there
are great leaders.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean all great
leaders are great Democrats.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
great leaders that we

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:84%
admire like Emperor Akbar of
the Moguls, who was an autocrat.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But there are autocrats
that actually do good,

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and there are certain
countries that we Americans

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.689 align:middle line:84%
seem to forget have their
own evolution of freedom.

00:14:59.689 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it works for them.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Well, people
in this country

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.430 align:middle line:84%
don't know that Vladimir
Putin's talked about this.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.010 align:middle line:84%
That he's saying that I see
myself like a new Peter the

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying in the
next 30, 40 years

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.920 align:middle line:84%
to help modernize
Russia and eventually

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.040 align:middle line:90%
make it a democratic state.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, this never gets
reported in the US news.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
What gets reported,
and what scares me

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:84%
because of the prophecies,
is that the whole way

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that these Cold War prophets,
except for Edgar Cayce,

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:84%
they all look at
that and they say

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:84%
the difference between three
versus World War I and II

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.720 align:middle line:84%
is that people walk into it
with their eyes wide open.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what Stormberger,
in the late 1700s,

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
said, with open eyes is how they
march into these catastrophes.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks that the
Cold War we had in the '80s

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and for 45 years was
the danger in its past.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:84%
But I've been saying
since that time, which

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
was dated by Nostradamus,
the ending of that war,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and a new one would come when
Russia and America both had

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:90%
eagles as their symbols.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:90%
Not a red star, not a red flag.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So the red flag in this
case is that Russia

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
since '92 and the
Russian Federation

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.104 align:middle line:84%
has the double-headed eagle
and America, the bald eagle.

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And Nostradamus used
a code, you know,

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:84%
a wolf was Italy, cock,
chicken, rooster was France.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we are in that
danger zone and November,

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.169 align:middle line:90%
the new president--

00:16:27.169 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:84%
if Hillary Clinton
had been in there,

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:84%
because she was
very much involved

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:84%
with the neoconservative,
neoliberal, a very much

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:90%
an activist towards it.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time since
the Cuban Missile Crisis

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
that I really felt that wow,
we all have about a year

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.321 align:middle line:90%
left to live.

00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow!

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.565 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Because of an accident.

00:16:44.565 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God,
John, that's scary.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: I know, it was scary.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing this
blackness that I don't--

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I never see blackness like
this, and it was kind of rising.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and it disappeared
when Trump was elected.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what happens
in the Trump world, whatever

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.970 align:middle line:84%
he is the catalyst for,
the thing that I saw

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:84%
is he's not a catalyst
for the deep state,

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.180 align:middle line:84%
the military surveillance
industrial complex, which

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:84%
wants to keep perpetuated
wars in the Middle East

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and a Cold War against
China and Russia.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.624 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
his greatest enemy

00:17:16.624 --> 00:17:18.540 align:middle line:84%
who would try to take
him down in impeachment.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you're right.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:84%
Back to Nostradamus
for a moment.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
He's had five prophecies
I want to talk about.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.846 align:middle line:84%
One, of course, he talks
about the third anti-Christ.

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR:
Nostradamus predicted

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that 2017 would bring the
rise of the third anti-Christ.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
This rise could actually result
in the beginning of World War

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
III, a nuclear war
or biological warfare

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.359 align:middle line:84%
that really sustain
for 27 years.

00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:84%
However, there has been
rumors that the war would

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.740 align:middle line:90%
be started by Russia or China.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
According to the Nostradamus
Society of America,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:84%
China would team up with
a few Muslim countries

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:90%
to destroy Christian countries.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.327 align:middle line:84%
Let's just hope
this doesn't happen.

00:17:56.327 --> 00:17:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
of that prophecy, John?

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.243 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: The first half
of what he is saying

00:18:00.243 --> 00:18:05.160 align:middle line:84%
is based on what is credible
translations of Nostradamus'

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
prophecies about the
third anti-Christ.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Where it kind of
goes off, in my view,

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.685 align:middle line:84%
is where China has a few Muslim
countries that it allies with.

00:18:16.685 --> 00:18:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Team up
to get us, yeah.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.601 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: China's
not so much involved

00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
in this, but Russia and
America-- the prophecies

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.260 align:middle line:84%
that deal with the long and
short countdown of 13 years

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
or three years and seven
months, the latter of which

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.450 align:middle line:84%
is happening this year
and the other in 2027,

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:84%
deal with the key being
a satrap, a henchman,

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:84%
a vassal of one or both
of these two eagle kings

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:90%
from the Middle East.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: And he
calls him Barbary.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Barbary is his
metaphor-- he often

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
used-- if he's going to
talk about Islamic terrorism

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:84%
in the future, he
talks about what

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
he knew in the 16th century
as the same thing, the Barbary

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
pirates, Barbary
corsairs, who used

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
to raid his homeland of
Provence all the time.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.900 align:middle line:84%
They hijacked ships in the sea,
rather than planes in the air.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And there is often,
in his mind, he

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:84%
uses what he knows
to describe things

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:90%
that are beyond his perception.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So Barbary is also
an anagram in French.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Another key-- people
keep translating

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.440 align:middle line:84%
anagrams, word codes,
into their own languages.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:84%
If they're not in
French, Latin, or Greek,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.980 align:middle line:84%
they're not anything, I contend,
that Nostradamus would say.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So I look at the French
and actually, Barbary

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.940 align:middle line:84%
spells out [ARABIC]
farmer of the Arab.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it's locating the
vassal is in that area.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, that could be the
Syrian and Hezbollah.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Could be Iran.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:90%
The Iranians--

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the Iranians
aren't Arabs, per se.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.550 align:middle line:90%
They're Persians.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: However, they
are the main allies

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Syrian regime
and the Russians.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So they're in the
mix, in the web.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have on
the American side,

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.260 align:middle line:84%
you have the Saudi Arabians,
who are a major part that's

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
not being stated in the news,
financing and training ISIS

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:90%
often.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:90%
They're in the Gulf states.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
The Arabs there
are also vassals.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And also although the
Turks are not vassals,

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:84%
the Sunni, that they tried to
create the Free Syrian Army

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.650 align:middle line:84%
with that failed
utterly, are allies.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:90%
So there's quite a weave.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you have Trump coming
into the situation on the one

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.310 align:middle line:84%
hand, who is actually wanting
to work with the Russians

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.279 align:middle line:90%
to end the war with ISIS.

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wants
to stop this, yeah.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.153 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Which goes against
the whole perpetual military

00:20:44.153 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:90%
industrial complex.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The plan wasn't
to stop it, right?

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Yeah, it's
very interesting

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.440 align:middle line:84%
to note when he had his
phone call with Putin, two

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:84%
days later, the Ukrainian
civil war resumed.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.381 align:middle line:84%
Poroshenko launched
on the Novi Russians.

00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:84%
That's actually what
happened, not the other way

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle line:84%
around because it was not
in their good alliances to--

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.734 align:middle line:90%
Putin wouldn't have hit Ukraine.

00:21:09.734 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:90%
It was the other way around.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, so reading
the signs of things

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that happen as language--
it's like when Putin says

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:84%
we arrested these two people
who might have been US

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.860 align:middle line:84%
moles from the previous
administration,

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.490 align:middle line:84%
he's not saying
anything directly,

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.370 align:middle line:84%
but he's saying to
Trump's administration,

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:33.760 align:middle line:84%
guess what, it might be
your people doing this.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So in the study of real politic,
a practical pragmatic politics

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
that looks beyond ideology,
this is what I use in my work,

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and I contend that it
makes my work accurate.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.436 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that third
anti-Christ here,

00:21:50.436 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Well, I wrote a book
and expanded it a couple times

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
since 2009, called "Nostradamus
and the Anti-Christ Code Named

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Mabus."

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.490 align:middle line:84%
M-A-B-U-S is an anagram
for the third anti-Christ.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.630 align:middle line:84%
That also plays well with
the leader of Islamic state.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Since I've talked to you,
I've added two more candidates

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:84%
to the original four, which
were Saddam Hussein, Osama bin

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Laden, Presidents George
W. Bush, and Barack Obama

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:84%
because all of their names,
they decode into Mabus.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And so does
al-Baghdadi and so does

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
his mentor, who was a hot
topic years ago in 2006,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:84%
but it suddenly went
cold when he was killed

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and that's Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,
who is the father of ISIS.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
He created al-Qaeda in Iraq,
which evolved into ISIS.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they droned him
or something, didn't they?

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Actually, al-Qaeda
sent information to the United

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
States and they hit him with 500
pound bombs and he was actually

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.579 align:middle line:90%
assassinated by American--

00:22:56.579 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Internal people.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: And because he was
such so against al-Qaeda.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why al-Qaeda
and ISIS hate each other

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.752 align:middle line:84%
because their founder
was murdered by al-Qaeda.

00:23:05.752 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:84%
They're all the same
people, aren't they?

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes but actually--

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:84%
well, they're both a
Shia Wahhabist-based,

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Salafist-based.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.254 align:middle line:84%
They're not in the Shia,
Hezbollah, Iranian-based look

00:23:22.254 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
at these things, which are
actually quite different.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.378 align:middle line:90%
That's the other thing.

00:23:25.378 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Such ignorance
going on in the news

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
about even the
origins of the Shia

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.520 align:middle line:90%
and the Sunni divide and Islam.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And I try in my
books, not only do

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I try to give them the whole
story of how that happened,

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:84%
how the schism happened,
how it's still alive.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
How it is playing as a back
note behind everything.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And if we understood that, then
we could solve this problem.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
al-Baghdadi then

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
became the next heir
and his name Abu Musab.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Abu, A-B-U, for father.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a code name many
activists in the Arab secular

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and Islamic guerrillas use
as a code name, father of.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, Abu Musab.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Musab, M-U-S-A-B is
Mabus scrambled around.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Abu, it's the anagram where you
drop the first and last letter.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it could
be one of them.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Mabus, Mabus.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could be one of them.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: And then
al-Baghdadi also has

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:90%
in his name similar things.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.750 align:middle line:90%
He's also an Abu.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:90%
So he has a system.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.795 align:middle line:90%
So when he dies--

00:24:29.795 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
because the thing with
the third anti-Christ,

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:84%
unlike Napoleon
and Hitler, which

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:84%
were Napoleon Roi,
Napoleon King,

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and Hister, the name of the
Danube where Hitler grew up.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Nostradamus loved to pinpoint
people geographically

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:90%
as persons by where they lived.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:84%
This person, if he
soon dies, they've

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.076 align:middle line:84%
nearly killed him
a few times, then

00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:84%
you have the
terrible destruction

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:90%
of people and animals.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:84%
The use of [FRENCH] in the 16th
century way that he uses it,

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.560 align:middle line:84%
means either it causes
the unraveling of people

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and animals, that means the
natural order of humanity

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and animals, which is
Nostradamus' way of talking

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
about an ecological
upheaval, which either

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:21.969 align:middle line:84%
is caused by what they do or it
is a background to the times.

00:25:21.969 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Because he would do
that to, give you

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.301 align:middle line:84%
something that says
this is going to happen

00:25:25.301 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:90%
when this is happening.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean they're
associated directly.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:31.136 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of climate
change, global warming

00:25:31.136 --> 00:25:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and how things
are getting hotter

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.174 align:middle line:84%
and how nature is
threatened could actually

00:25:35.174 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:84%
either be caused
certainly if this

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:84%
leads to dragging the
Russians and the Americans

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
into a war because of
their vassals, Barbary

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.220 align:middle line:90%
and all these people.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, Baghdadi
was also an informant

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.720 align:middle line:84%
for a time for the US,
just as Saddam Hussein was.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's a pattern
that the vassals that

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.350 align:middle line:84%
become the evil enemies
or the new boogeyman

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
created by the military
industrial complex

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and even somewhat aided by
situations that they promote.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:84%
That leads us to this situation,
which could happen as soon--

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:90%
couple of things.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It could happen as
late as November.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:84%
But I was just looking
at something this morning

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.342 align:middle line:84%
related to Iran, which is
not Arab but still related.

00:26:13.342 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still related.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.341 align:middle line:90%
Still in the Middle East.

00:26:15.341 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: And I said
that for years now

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.850 align:middle line:84%
that there was Nostradamus
and the war in Iran

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and my book on his prophecies,
which are very clear, really

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.260 align:middle line:84%
out in the open,
I can see he takes

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.680 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous significance in
what Iran and America will

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:90%
do in the future.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.470 align:middle line:84%
If they go to war,
it could start

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.880 align:middle line:84%
all of this as a
escalating problem because

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:84%
of the intersectine, twisted
spider web of alliances

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:84%
that we're caught into it, like
a bug in the spider's web, that

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
pulls Russia and
America into this war.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
The thing that could also
be important to look at

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:84%
is, I also talked on your show
about this dating of astrology,

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:84%
where Nostradamus talked
about when Mars and Saturn are

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.740 align:middle line:90%
equally fiery.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I thought when they were
both in the same fire sign--

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:09.200 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't happen that often--

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.350 align:middle line:84%
when they're equally fiery and
especially in the same sign.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, that happened in
August and September of 2016

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and I was really thinking that
this is either the time when

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:84%
a major war would
happen, or it would

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:84%
be the time when the seed
was planted for the motion

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.040 align:middle line:90%
to go towards that war later.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it could be that.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Well, here's the thing.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I was checking the astrology
again, George, this morning,

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that Mars
is not in the same sign.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is in
Sagittarius, both times,

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
but right now, as we're taping
this and for another month,

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Mars is in Aries, I believe.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.240 align:middle line:90%
I think it's Aries, yes.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's the sign of war.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.637 align:middle line:84%
And it's been on since January,
since the presidency started,

00:27:53.637 --> 00:27:54.845 align:middle line:90%
and look at all the upheaval.

00:27:54.845 --> 00:27:55.645 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know it.

00:27:55.645 --> 00:27:56.570 align:middle line:90%
It is unbelievable.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.820 align:middle line:84%
John, let's get into some
of these other prophecies

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:90%
of Nostradamus as well.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.450 align:middle line:90%
He said something about Italy.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Nostradamus
also predicted

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:84%
that the Italian economy will
experience great hardship

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and will be the reason for
the collapse of the EU economy

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.200 align:middle line:90%
and not Spain or Greek.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.230 align:middle line:84%
As you probably didn't know,
the Italian banking industry

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.830 align:middle line:84%
is already on the
verge of collapsing.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:22.160 align:middle line:84%
18% of the loans in these banks
are already non-performing.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
In the coming days, it
is likely that there

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.700 align:middle line:84%
will be more and
more of the decline

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:84%
in these loans due to a
rising number of loans.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Reviving this
economy will require

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:84%
the sacrifices of many people,
including the entire EU.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, so that's
another telltale sign.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: You know, he's
right, that is out there,

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:84%
but I would contend
there's a prophecy, quite

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.530 align:middle line:84%
a stunning prophecy
of Nostradamus,

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:84%
that talks about
the great market.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:57.230 align:middle line:10%
And it's regards to this
great market, which is the EU,

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:10%
its first sign of collapse is
through Athens, the Greeks.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.482 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We saw that a year ago.

00:29:03.482 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: The whole Greek issue,
and it could come up again.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So as much as Italy-- and I am
watching the Italian situation.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And I do think Italy
will leave next year

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and become independent
of the monetary union.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And it might actually be
profitable for them to do so.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is
that in this prophecy

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.210 align:middle line:84%
there is an
astrological prediction

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.449 align:middle line:84%
and it also talks about
England, how England--

00:29:28.449 --> 00:29:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it's almost global.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Well, Greece, step one.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Brexit, step two.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And then he dates the
complete breakdown

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.380 align:middle line:84%
of European Union in an
astrological aspect that

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:48.094 align:middle line:84%
happens in the year
2021 in the summer.

00:29:48.094 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not far away.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Not far away.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And the astrological connection
between the United States

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and America is
almost like twins.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Its different aspects but they
point to the same destiny.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:90%
One falls, one rises.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:90%
One rises, one falls.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I've always
said for years,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:90%
even though it doesn't seem to--

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:84%
there's two economic
crises coming,

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:14.760 align:middle line:84%
one as soon as latter half
of 2017 after the eclipse

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:90%
but especially in 2018.

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.110 align:middle line:90%
It's an inflationary crisis.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Globally
or United States?

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: It is globally.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:27.815 align:middle line:84%
And it will be saved by the IMF,
which has about $55 trillion

00:30:27.815 --> 00:30:28.910 align:middle line:90%
of fiat--

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fiat money,
nothing backing up.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: And so it will save
the central and federal banks,

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.660 align:middle line:84%
federal reserves of America
and the Central Bank of Europe,

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.570 align:middle line:84%
but it'll be a much bigger
shock than the last one.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.610 align:middle line:84%
But it will recover,
but then it's only

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:44.950 align:middle line:90%
going to be for a few years.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Then the fiat system
will collapse by 2021.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.480 align:middle line:90%
But here's some good news.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Already, people are
beginning to move

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.920 align:middle line:84%
into alternative currencies,
crypto currencies.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Right now--

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bitcoins.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Bitcoin itself
is in its infancy,

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.590 align:middle line:84%
but just like the first guys
who flew the plane crashed them

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:84%
a lot, there will be a
Wilbur/Orville Wright

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.920 align:middle line:84%
moment where
mathematics will be made

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:84%
the new source of wealth rooted
again to silver and gold.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe that.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Another prediction
of Nostradamus

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
whack job in Korea.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
he saw that or not

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.744 align:middle line:84%
but Korea was one
of the predictions.

00:31:30.744 --> 00:31:32.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: What is the
possibility that North Korea

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.140 align:middle line:10%
and South Korea will merge?

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:39.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, Nostradamus predicted that
in 2017, North and South Korea

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:10%
will merge and
become one nation.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Amidst all these, Kim Jong-un,
the North Korean strongman,

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.140 align:middle line:84%
will be dethroned and will
run and seek asylum in Russia.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Since 2011, when Kim Un took
over power from his father

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:84%
upon his death, he has
proven to be more dangerous

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.970 align:middle line:90%
than his father was.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:00.510 align:middle line:84%
He has already executed
several people by firing squad,

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:04.000 align:middle line:84%
among them his closest
family members and relatives.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.900 align:middle line:84%
He has already tested a
nuclear weapon during this time

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and threatened to use it
against the United States.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's conceivable
he killed off his stepbrother.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.637 align:middle line:84%
So what does Nostradamus
say about this.

00:32:15.637 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: First off, it's
pretty naive of the Nostradamus

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Society if this is
where it's sourced from.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of
things about this--

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.370 align:middle line:84%
that they, oh, he
killed some people.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean even Trump
surprisingly said

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.180 align:middle line:90%
something that needed to say.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, hey, do you think
we're innocent, you know?

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And even though he did it in
his eight-year-old boyish way,

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:36.840 align:middle line:90%
it's true.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's true.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.641 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: And he said it's true.

00:32:38.641 --> 00:32:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the thing.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I swear, George,
when I saw this,

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I thought they had been
watching Coast to Coast

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.730 align:middle line:84%
when you and I were
talking about this.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
prophecy that says

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.450 align:middle line:84%
this is going to
happen that I've found,

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:54.480 align:middle line:84%
but I did talk to you about
how there is a possibility

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.010 align:middle line:84%
that if there's an implosion
in the North Korean State, that

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.110 align:middle line:84%
to stop a union of
North and South Korea,

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:84%
China might come
in to save the day

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and stop a humanitary crisis of
millions of people coming in.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.710 align:middle line:90%
So I sometimes--

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.414 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's unfortunate
that they don't, since they

00:33:13.414 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:84%
had the means to do this,
they didn't actually

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:90%
bring up the verses.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Like whenever I can, I
try to bring up the verses

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and I hope, even
though we are just

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:22.770 align:middle line:84%
talking about these
things, that people

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:27.110 align:middle line:84%
will go to hopeprophecy.com and
see that I back up everything

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.304 align:middle line:90%
I say.

00:33:28.304 --> 00:33:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the Korean guy,
something could happen there.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Oh, yes.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I keep thinking there's going to
be a moment where if Korea goes

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:84%
a certain way, North
Korea, Trump just

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:84%
might lob a missile into
the gantry and just say,

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.140 align:middle line:90%
enough is enough.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And he may be the one to say
that no one else is talked

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:90%
about because it's true--

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.500 align:middle line:84%
we've station at least
two Trident submarines

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:84%
on either side of
the Korean peninsula

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and if you fired anything
at us, you would be ash.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he might let Putin
know we've got to stop this.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Here's the other thing.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:03.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not Putin.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:07.400 align:middle line:84%
This is where they're also not
very geopolitically literate.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.989 align:middle line:84%
The Russians have very little
to do with North Korea.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.820 align:middle line:90%
North Korea is China's problem.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Speaking of China,
let's look at another prophecy,

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.106 align:middle line:90%
first of all.

00:34:16.106 --> 00:34:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR:
Nostradamus predicted

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that China will make very
bold moves and great strides

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:90%
in 2017.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.969 align:middle line:84%
We can already see how China is
impacting the global community.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:84%
According to
Nostradamus, China will

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.679 align:middle line:84%
be the nation that cures
the great economic imbalance

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.630 align:middle line:90%
experienced in the world.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:36.199 align:middle line:10%
Since 1978, China has moved from
being a mere marginal player

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:39.800 align:middle line:10%
in the global economy to a mega
player with the safest cards

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.969 align:middle line:10%
to play.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:44.730 align:middle line:10%
It is also possible that China
may become the next superpower.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.139 align:middle line:10%
We are yet to find that out,
but if the moves that China

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.940 align:middle line:10%
has taken in the recent
past are anything to go by,

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:10%
then this possibility
is not far fetched.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.242 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tie that into
what you just said, John.

00:34:55.242 --> 00:34:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: They're saying
it's happening in 2017.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I swear, they must
be watching us.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.870 align:middle line:84%
It's my opinion that
they will expand.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But what actually
Nostradamus said

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.279 align:middle line:84%
is in his famous 1999 prophecy,
where he talks about--

00:35:11.279 --> 00:35:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is like
when something else

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:16.760 align:middle line:84%
is happening to give you an
idea of when it's happening--

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.490 align:middle line:84%
that when there would be this
terror from the sky hitting

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:24.620 align:middle line:84%
the skyscrapers, actually
1999 was a code for 2001 11,

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:90%
but that's another story.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:84%
What it did say is that
"they shall resurrect

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.590 align:middle line:90%
the King of the Mongols."

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the red Chinese
government, around the time

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
the end of the century,
did resurrect Genghis Khan

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.080 align:middle line:84%
as a role model for
the way totalitarianism

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.940 align:middle line:90%
works in a command economy.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an indication that,
at the turn of the century,

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.950 align:middle line:84%
that's when you would
see China break out

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:47.900 align:middle line:84%
as the potential
economic superpower.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.130 align:middle line:90%
So they say 2017.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I was saying it 17 years
ago in that regard.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, there is not a lot
of Nostradamus' prophesies

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:90%
about Asia.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.490 align:middle line:90%
He was very territorial.

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:05.410 align:middle line:84%
His remote viewing was quite
dense around his local area,

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.040 align:middle line:84%
but his psychic
powers thinned out

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.860 align:middle line:84%
as it got farther
and farther away.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:14.600 align:middle line:84%
But with that said,
I would say, looking

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.890 align:middle line:84%
at from my own prophetic
work, that there's

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.290 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous opportunity
with the crisis that's

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:25.640 align:middle line:84%
coming with climate
change for President Trump

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.990 align:middle line:90%
to be the next FDR and repeat--

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:84%
we're in a cycle of the
fourth turning, which

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.467 align:middle line:84%
is an 80-year,
four-generation cycle that

00:36:34.467 --> 00:36:36.550 align:middle line:84%
was created by the
futurologists Strauss and Howe.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it seems
to happen all the time.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.841 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Which
fortunately, Trump's--

00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:41.960 align:middle line:84%
one of his chief
advisers is as much

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.945 align:middle line:84%
a student of the Fourth
Turning as I am, Steve Bannon.

00:36:44.945 --> 00:36:45.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he?

00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:47.786 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: He is quite well
knowledgeable about it.

00:36:47.786 --> 00:36:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Never gets reported
in the press.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Which makes me feel
good that at least Trump

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.830 align:middle line:84%
has a man that looks
at these cycles

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and see that we're
in another one.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.600 align:middle line:90%
And so the crisis happens again.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.510 align:middle line:90%
It's happening now.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:02.180 align:middle line:84%
It happened in World War II
and the economic depression

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.410 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:07.400 align:middle line:84%
What we're basically seeing
is the arsenal of democracy

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.470 align:middle line:84%
that Roosevelt
made, which created

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:13.310 align:middle line:84%
the wealth that put us on the
prosperity up to this point.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Trump has the same opportunity
to repeat that again

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:18.536 align:middle line:84%
in what I call the
arsenal of ecology,

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:19.910 align:middle line:84%
where, at a certain
point-- and I

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.650 align:middle line:84%
feel that the latter
half of this year

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:24.380 align:middle line:84%
there are such natural disasters
that are coming related

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.770 align:middle line:84%
to climate and also seismic
things that I think Trump's

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:31.610 align:middle line:84%
life decisions are going
to be changed, and either

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:35.210 align:middle line:84%
from a personal tragedy
or from property loss,

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.820 align:middle line:84%
that he is actually-- and
he's almost there now.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:41.655 align:middle line:84%
He's actually going to freak
out a lot of the deniers

00:37:41.655 --> 00:37:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and actually one day
he's going to say,

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:84%
yeah, global
warming's real and I'm

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:84%
going to make America great
again by actually redesigning

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:84%
a whole new industry
that nobody else can do.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So America, if
it's going to sink

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:56.750 align:middle line:84%
or swim in this
redefinition of itself,

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:84%
has this Roosevelt moment
where we tool ourselves

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:03.290 align:middle line:84%
into a completely
different economy,

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.840 align:middle line:84%
puts everybody back to work,
and leads the world in this.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And if Trump is late in this,
China will lead the world

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.699 align:middle line:84%
and America will be
in the second place.

00:38:12.699 --> 00:38:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Nostradamus
would have been correct again.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the last
prediction of Nostradamus here,

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:18.530 align:middle line:90%
John.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Nostradamus
was a great French seer,

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.440 align:middle line:10%
who was famed for various
predictions during his time.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.620 align:middle line:84%
It is claimed that he predicted
the Great Depression, the rise

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.950 align:middle line:84%
of Adolph Hitler, and many other
things that later came to pass,

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.440 align:middle line:84%
including the World
Trade Center attacks.

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.290 align:middle line:84%
He died in 1566,
but before then, it

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.070 align:middle line:84%
is suggested that
he also predicted

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:84%
that Donald Trump would be the
President of the United States.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.856 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he,
indeed, predict that?

00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: You know, he didn't.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.440 align:middle line:84%
This one-- a lot of these have
been pretty good but this--

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.240 align:middle line:90%
except for--

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.031 align:middle line:84%
the statements he said
about all the things

00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:54.790 align:middle line:84%
that Nostradamus did predict up
to Trump, yes, that's all true.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:56.580 align:middle line:90%
He did do that.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.090 align:middle line:84%
But what happened, towards
the end of the election,

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.980 align:middle line:84%
there was very
rapidly put together

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.660 align:middle line:84%
a documentary on
History Channel, which

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I was involved with called
"Nostradamus Election 2016."

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And what was on that, that had
nothing to do with anything

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I said-- in fact, my stuff was
mostly left on the fringes,

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:90%
thank goodness.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But what other Nostradamus
scholars talked about--

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:26.040 align:middle line:84%
one in particular,
which I will not name--

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:31.860 align:middle line:84%
clearly from looking at
what this person does,

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.070 align:middle line:84%
he does what those blind
believers in Nostradamus do.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he's the man
who says on the show,

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Nostradamus always
gets it right.

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:42.870 align:middle line:84%
He certainly does when
he always gives you

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:44.410 align:middle line:90%
what you're looking for.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.194 align:middle line:90%
And then how do you look for it?

00:39:46.194 --> 00:39:47.610 align:middle line:84%
You go and look
at everything that

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:51.900 align:middle line:84%
sounds like Trump in
French like trombe, which

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.310 align:middle line:90%
means whirlwind, not trumpet.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.580 align:middle line:84%
It can be used for
trumpet but it's mostly

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:84%
used for, in old
French, for whirlwind.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Or trompette, every time the
trumpet call is in there.

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So what he did is he'd
take a trumpet here, take

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:10.050 align:middle line:84%
a trumpet there, and talk
about the bawling brawler.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:12.000 align:middle line:84%
But he'd forget that
it actually names

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:84%
the Siege of
Pontefract, which means

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Oliver Cromwell from the 1700s.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And so long story short, so
I don't get all geek on you,

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:27.450 align:middle line:84%
is that if you only read
that bit of the prophecy that

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:30.010 align:middle line:84%
works for you, just like a lot
of people misread the Bible.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:84%
They just find a little verse
here and a little thing there,

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.499 align:middle line:84%
and then they've got a whole
worldview of Christianity

00:40:34.499 --> 00:40:37.650 align:middle line:84%
or the Old Testament that's
maybe completely in their head,

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.350 align:middle line:84%
but it becomes a cult
or something like that.

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's people who take
Nostradamus in the same way,

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately,
that documentary

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.780 align:middle line:84%
created another
new myth that's now

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.340 align:middle line:84%
out there that the yellow
journalists and everybody is

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.140 align:middle line:90%
playing with.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And so anything that is fake,
we seem to latch onto it.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.440 align:middle line:84%
It's so much harder
to get people

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.510 align:middle line:84%
to get turned on
to the real verses

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and this trumpet/Trump
thing is the same.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.730 align:middle line:84%
There's one possibility
but even then,

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:11.580 align:middle line:90%
it's about Egypt and Byzantium.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:90%
So I'm keeping my eye on that.

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And if there is
anything in Nostradamus,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and I imagine there
must be if he's--

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
to be something.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: It's going
to be like what

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.850 align:middle line:90%
happened with George W. Bush.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.087 align:middle line:90%
No one really figured--

00:41:22.087 --> 00:41:23.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people
thought this one verse

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:84%
that talked about
[FRENCH], a doubtful one,

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.580 align:middle line:84%
would come into the US Capitol
and the Capitol would not

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.380 align:middle line:90%
want him at all.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's spelled
with an O-L, capitol.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:34.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's very rare.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's very specific.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And I even, back
in 97, when I did

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.902 align:middle line:84%
a complete translation of
Nostradamus, my first one,

00:41:42.902 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:84%
said, well, it looks like this
might be about Richard Nixon

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.187 align:middle line:90%
and Watergate.

00:41:46.187 --> 00:41:47.145 align:middle line:90%
I don't quite know how.

00:41:47.145 --> 00:41:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: But I kind
of left it open.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But then after
2000, I realized--

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:53.250 align:middle line:90%
because here's the thing.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.950 align:middle line:84%
When these prophecies come
closer to their fulfillment,

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:59.310 align:middle line:90%
more of the details come clear.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And who would have thought
before the year 2000

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:06.570 align:middle line:84%
that you have this
nickname-loving prophet, who

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:14.040 align:middle line:84%
latches onto a nickname-loving
President called W, [FRENCH]?

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:20.970 align:middle line:84%
If you then put Bush into
it, a W, [FRENCH], it fits.

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I would then say
it's about Bush.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.660 align:middle line:90%
So I am looking for--

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.020 align:middle line:90%
and it could be anything.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.890 align:middle line:84%
It could be-- it could be
something that Trump says.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:30.640 align:middle line:84%
It could have something
to do with towers.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:35.580 align:middle line:84%
It could be-- the
lexicon is wide open.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So I am on the hunt
and if I find anything,

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.680 align:middle line:84%
you'll be one of
the first to know.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
the best at that.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Climate change-- regardless
of what people believe,

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:48.090 align:middle line:84%
what could be causing it,
whether it's an Earth cycle

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:52.920 align:middle line:84%
or man made created, things
are happening on this planet.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.850 align:middle line:84%
As Nostradamus would look
at it, what has he seen?

00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Well, I wrote a
paper, predictions for 2015,

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:84%
top 10 predictions, where I
talked about the fire and ice

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.010 align:middle line:90%
prophecies.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:12.120 align:middle line:84%
It was a culmination of 25
years of studying this question.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Is climate change a cycle?

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Is climate change actually a
precursor to a new Ice Age?

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And I came to the conclusion,
looking at the science,

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.850 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
prophetic glimpses

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:27.720 align:middle line:84%
with the science, Nostradamus
talks about rising oceans.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.890 align:middle line:90%
He talks about--

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As Edgar Cayce did.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: He did.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:37.770 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about a Dark
Age that's hot, not cold,

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:90%
the heating up of the world.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And so according to
the general tenor--

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and I looked at all of them
and I present both sides--

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:48.630 align:middle line:84%
but the vast majority of the
collective visions of different

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:52.440 align:middle line:84%
traditions is that we're heading
towards a temperature warming

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.350 align:middle line:84%
cascade, similar
to the Permian--

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.390 align:middle line:84%
potentially the
Permian extinction,

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:01.830 align:middle line:84%
if we go that far with it,
Where we raise the temperature

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:04.640 align:middle line:90%
two Celsius or six.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Two Celsius is already--

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:09.230 align:middle line:84%
it's already bad
enough that it's 1.8.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Imagine a two.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Imagine a six.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Well, at six it becomes
a civilization-threatening

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.420 align:middle line:90%
event.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then we have a problem.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: But beyond that, it
could double because six could

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.690 align:middle line:84%
do a positive feedback loop like
what happened in the Permian

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:27.480 align:middle line:84%
extinction that caused a
12-degree Celsius lift,

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.160 align:middle line:90%
which almost killed--

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.016 align:middle line:90%
96% of life.

00:44:30.016 --> 00:44:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But do you
see this happening?

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Does Nostradamus
see this happening?

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Well, he sees it.

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Others see it.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.230 align:middle line:84%
It's almost biblical in the
fires, fires in the sky, things

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:41.970 align:middle line:90%
falling down.

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.000 align:middle line:84%
At 45 degrees latitude
across the world,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.890 align:middle line:84%
the sun burns the fields, you
know, and green belts is vast.

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.020 align:middle line:84%
His descriptions
in two quatrains

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.740 align:middle line:84%
about where there will come a
time where famine is sporadic

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.170 align:middle line:84%
here and there and
then become worldwide.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:03.270 align:middle line:84%
He said it will be so complete
and long-lasting that bark

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.990 align:middle line:84%
will be ripped off the trees and
babies stolen from the breast.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.906 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:45:06.906 --> 00:45:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Yeah.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As we wrap up, John,
give us John Hogue's biggest

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:middle line:90%
prophecy for the years ahead.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.230 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Well, we have
entered early into what

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.110 align:middle line:90%
I call the roaring 2020s.

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And the most significant
decade of human trial

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and travail but potential
for human breakthrough.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And it deals with things coming
to a head, climate change, fiat

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:42.210 align:middle line:84%
economy, a broken democratic
system, a political culture

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.150 align:middle line:84%
war with the totalitarian
Chinese system.

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:47.080 align:middle line:90%
They're saying, see, we work.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Democracy doesn't work.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And we are in the cycle of
fascism again during the 2020s.

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:53.430 align:middle line:90%
It also has come up.

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Fascism always thrives
when democracy fails.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even Socrates said,
in Plato's "The Republic,"

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.820 align:middle line:84%
only democracy is the
birthplace of totalitarianism.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's because democracy
when it's mobocracy fails.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.090 align:middle line:90%
And so we are in this cycle.

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And so for what
I see about this,

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and what I also see beyond--
we'll get through it.

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:22.230 align:middle line:84%
But I also see that
our political system

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that we think is the
omega of democratic system

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.600 align:middle line:90%
is just the beginning.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have a book
planned where I

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:32.580 align:middle line:84%
will look 700 to 1,000
years into the future

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and look at the five major
evolutions of politics

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:43.020 align:middle line:84%
in the human race and it
starts with mobocracy,

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.690 align:middle line:90%
goes into fascism again.

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:47.280 align:middle line:90%
This is our first step.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.980 align:middle line:84%
But then after that, you
will have meritocracy,

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and politics is based
on merit but based

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:57.990 align:middle line:84%
on all people are
created equally unique

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and meditation is the way that
all of us can grow spiritually.

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:03.551 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you see us 1,000
years from now still existing.

00:47:03.551 --> 00:47:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGUE: Oh, yeah.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:06.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm waiting for
a time if I could just

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.300 align:middle line:84%
clone enough of myself
to write all the books.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I have planned for you and
my readers a deep journey

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.510 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And I may actually
convey a lot of this

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.440 align:middle line:84%
like Whitley Strieber
does sometimes

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.660 align:middle line:84%
in the Greys and
stuff, through fiction.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:25.350 align:middle line:10%
But it's like-- it's like
H.G. Wells using fiction.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:28.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm hiding my prophecies
about things in the future.

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:29.940 align:middle line:10%
I have a story
that will take you

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.187 align:middle line:10%
a million years
into human history.

00:47:32.187 --> 00:47:33.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's good to know that.

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.430 align:middle line:10%
John, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:39.420 align:middle line:84%
We appreciate everything you do,
your prophecies of Nostradamus,

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.040 align:middle line:90%
your own prophecies.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.740 align:middle line:84%
It's gonna be a bumpy road,
but we'll get there, won't we.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGUE: Every birth
has pain, but it

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:47.730 align:middle line:90%
brings a beautiful ending.

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a way
to finish the program.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:57.803 align:middle line:90%
