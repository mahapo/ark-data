>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.400 align:middle line:10%
In this edition, Kaedrich
Olsen is with us.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Author, speaker, and
teacher who specializes

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:84%
in alternative paths
of spiritual growth.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Kaedrich, welcome
to the program.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEDRICH OLSEN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited to be here.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I grew up with it.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.477 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: I lived in a house
that was completely haunted.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:10%
You would set something down,
turn around, it would be gone.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:10%
You would be in
the bathroom, you'd

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:10%
hear footsteps going up
and down the hallway.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:10%
You'd open the door,
nobody's there.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:10%
You could hear a toilet
flush in the basement

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:10%
when you're upstairs.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody there.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.197 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Nobody there.

00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And so to help deal
with this, my parents

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.050 align:middle line:84%
took us to a
spiritualist church,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
which is your typical
Protestant church.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
You stand up, sit
down, stand up, sing.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.115 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they witness these
things going on at the house,

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:90%
too?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:90%
It was just, it was continuous.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're at the church,
they end all of their services

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:90%
with trance mediumship.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:84%
We call it trance
channeling today.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And then every Saturday
night was a seance.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.377 align:middle line:84%
So I learned how to work with
spirits from elementary school

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:25.460 align:middle line:90%
throughout my entire life.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it
sounds like your parents

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:90%
helped encourage you.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:90%
I had great parents.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
They let me explore
different paths

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.377 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality and
different growths.

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:84%
They weren't the
restrictive ones that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.168 align:middle line:90%
said you have to be this way.

00:01:37.168 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:90%
You have to learn this.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.798 align:middle line:90%
They're like, OK.

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and explore and learn.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you've
had this connection

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
with the spirit world
since you were a youngster.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.313 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:01:45.313 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge part of my life.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it has gotten
bigger and bigger and bigger

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Hasn't it?

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the things that
astounded me over the years

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:84%
is because it was such a
normal natural part of my life

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
that as I started
exploring other routes

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality
teaching, I started

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:84%
realizing other
people didn't have

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.252 align:middle line:84%
this as a natural normal
part of their life.

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
I would look around
and like, well,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.585 align:middle line:84%
aren't you in communication
with these higher

00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:10.920 align:middle line:90%
beings that can guide you?

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And people
would say, well,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm having these
problems in the house.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, yeah.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Just do this and that.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.785 align:middle line:90%
They're like what?

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:90%
How do you--

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, huh?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:90%
You aren't getting this?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a while
to finally realize

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that my upbringing
wasn't natural and normal

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:90%
for everybody else.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.882 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:84%
You thought this was
routine for everybody.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I honestly did.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I had people
over the years

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
goad me into teaching
classes on seances.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.122 align:middle line:84%
On working with people
to help with protection

00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:90%
and clearing the house.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And working with ghost
hunters to help prepare them.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So when they go investigating
locations where there's

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.998 align:middle line:84%
some bad juju going on that
they can protect themselves

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:90%
and keep themselves safe.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.373 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I didn't realize
there was a need for this

00:02:48.373 --> 00:02:49.173 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:02:49.173 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been coming out
more and more with what I know

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.847 align:middle line:84%
and what I've learned over
the years to help people.

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kaedrich,
what is, what you are,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.322 align:middle line:84%
a paranormal
protection specialist?

00:02:58.322 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: This is
where I've learned

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of understanding
of the paranormal

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:90%
has gotten out of hand.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.813 align:middle line:84%
The TV shows, the
movie shows, all

00:03:06.813 --> 00:03:08.105 align:middle line:90%
of these things and the media--

00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, it's crazy.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
They're presenting
that the paranormal

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
is a scary, frightening,
terrible thing.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's reinforced with certain
religious groups out there.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is not my
experience whatsoever.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm helping
people who are

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.045 align:middle line:84%
generating some of
these negativity things

00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
or encountering some of
the negative problems

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:84%
in their life to deal with
it in a practical way.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So that we can
peacefully coexist

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.060 align:middle line:84%
with the paranormal
reality around us.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do a lot of
work in the area of seances.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Don't you?

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you
do that, what rituals

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.220 align:middle line:84%
do you perform during a seance
to keep the bad entities away?

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:84%
What's important to remember
with the paranormal and working

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
with paranormal, no
matter the situation,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:84%
is a little maxim
that similarities

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:90%
attract and perpetuate.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your mindset
is going into working

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.092 align:middle line:84%
with the paranormal is what
you're going to bring to you.

00:04:02.092 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you see a horror movie
that really portrays something

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
scary and then you
go to do a seance,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
scared and frightened.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Or people will get a
Ouija board for what

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
they've seen on the
movie and they'll

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.497 align:middle line:90%
sit down with a Ouija board.

00:04:12.497 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're scared and then
they will attract something that

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:90%
is feeding off of that fear.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:84%
That is going to be a
negative experience for them

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:90%
and they're like, see.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:90%
I told you this was a bad thing.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.040 align:middle line:90%
We need to stop doing that.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I set
the space around us.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:90%
I create a sacred space.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.178 align:middle line:90%
I put wards on all of the walls.

00:04:30.178 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:90%
I clear the energy in the room.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And I raise the energy to
a better state of being.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.123 align:middle line:84%
And then I have people
go into a meditation

00:04:37.123 --> 00:04:39.290 align:middle line:84%
where they connect with
their own sense of awareness

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:90%
of what is sacred.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And they bring
that sacred energy

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:84%
through their body, their
being when they're there.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So that they are in a
sacred place internally

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and externally.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So that the work that
we're doing in a seance

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:84%
connects them with
higher level beings

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
that have their best
interest in mind.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of our Gaia crews
followed you to your studio

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.285 align:middle line:84%
where you perform
one of these rituals.

00:04:59.285 --> 00:05:09.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: When it comes
to doing a seance,

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.877 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important rules
that I keep in mind that I

00:05:13.877 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:84%
teach everybody is
that similarities

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:90%
attract and perpetuate.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear me say
this quite often.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And what this means is whatever
your mindset is, whatever

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:84%
your frame of being is, is the
type of entities and spirits

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that you will attract
to you in seance.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:84%
To establish the
proper mindset, we

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:84%
do a ritual for setting
sacred space around us.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:84%
To ensure that the
workings of seance

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
is peaceful and
happy for everybody.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:90%
By my will, I seal this wall.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:90%
By my will, I seal this wall.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:90%
By my will, I seal this wall.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And by my will,
I seal this wall.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:90%
By my will, I seal the ceiling.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.545 align:middle line:84%
And by my will,
I seal the floor.

00:06:11.545 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's my will that any
entity, being, thought

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
form, resident
pattern, or vibration,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:84%
or frequency that is not a
part of the working on this day

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:90%
do depart and clear this space.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And by my will, I
seal this portal.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that we are now
in sacred, safe space.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do
you seal each wall?

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It creates a barrier.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, a
semi-permeable barrier

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:84%
where only things of
a higher vibration

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:84%
can transit through
that barrier.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So if it is a lower level
entity, a negative entity,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:84%
or something that
has malicious intent,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
it cannot traverse
through the wall.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.373 align:middle line:84%
But a higher level
being or a being

00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:84%
that you do want to
connect with, say, a loved

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
one or an ancestor
or spirit guide,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.430 align:middle line:90%
can come through that wall.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you say by
my will, what does that do?

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Will is that power
that we have within us

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:90%
as a sacred force.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle line:84%
It is the goal of
your higher being

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
to exist in this world,
its purpose here.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're using that
as a projective force

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that your intention
is manifested in the way

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.700 align:middle line:90%
that you want it to be.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.617 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are your rituals
the same all over the place?

00:07:32.617 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:84%
There may be slight variations
depending on the audience

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:90%
and the situation.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, it is the same.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:90%
We seal each of the walls.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:90%
We seal the ceiling, the floor.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we clear
the space in between.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there's an error in
sealing the wall, what happens?

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.857 align:middle line:90%
What could happen?

00:07:48.857 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Never had that problem.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Even if I stumble my
words or if I will do it

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:84%
in old Norse versus
English and then maybe I'll

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:84%
do another wall in
English or old Norse,

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
all that those words are, are
a projection of my intention.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:84%
They just are a way to
convey the energy of what

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm working with.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So as long as my
mindset is there,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
as long as I'm projecting
there, there's no problem.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
workings that I do

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
see behind the scenes

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:84%
is I've stretched my awareness
to the space around me.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm clearing
the space around me.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Even though my words and my body
are performing certain actions,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.790 align:middle line:84%
my spirit, my soul are
performing something auxiliary

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.290 align:middle line:84%
to all of that, that is
the real basis of the work.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I could make up
any word that I wanted,

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.067 align:middle line:84%
do any little action that I want
as long as the working still

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:90%
does what I need it to do.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.192 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how do you
know that it's working?

00:08:38.192 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I can feel
the shift in the room.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that you'll notice

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
when I do seance or
ritual-type thing

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
is that the energy flows
through like air flow.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Like you maybe have a fan going
or the air conditioner going,

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:90%
you can feel the air flow.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But when I set the walls
and I set the wards

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and I clear the space, it almost
feels a little bit stuffy,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
a little bit stagnant,
because the energy just

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.310 align:middle line:84%
gets held into that
room, and then it raises.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you could feel
that the entire time.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Then when I let the wards
go and I drop the wards,

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
you can feel that
air flowing again,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:84%
just like it's a dam released
and that water is flowing out.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there are
other esoteric practices

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.020 align:middle line:90%
that you perform?

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I work a lot with
the Norse tradition.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So runes are a huge part of
what I do and I teach people

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:90%
that you have runes inside you.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:84%
The way that you connect with
runes, such as the rune Fehu,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:90%
is all about values.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you connect with
what your value is,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
for Fehu, that becomes reflected
in the world around you.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And I will bring those
runes into ritual,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
such as the rune Algiz,
is a protective rune that

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:84%
connects you to the sacred
powers and the upper world.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And so if I were to
conjure Algiz and Galdr,

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:84%
the rune Algiz on a
wall, that sets the room

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:90%
as sacred space with that rune.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You lead
seance training.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
What exactly do
you teach people?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Ah, we go
through various stages

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:90%
throughout the process.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it is about
shifting your mindset

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.530 align:middle line:84%
to be in tune to a
higher state of being,

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
to understand how fear could
come into the role of seance

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:90%
and mess things up.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you're feeling that
fear, how to shift out

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:90%
of that fear state.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, ultimately, it's
about building your intuition.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.260 align:middle line:84%
We'll start off with
a pendulum to learn

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:90%
how to do yes or no answers.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have a pendulum.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:21.707 align:middle line:90%
Describe what that is.

00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: A pendulum.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.582 align:middle line:90%
I can even show you here.

00:10:23.582 --> 00:10:25.860 align:middle line:90%
I've got my pendulum that I use.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.370 align:middle line:84%
It is a weight at the end
of a string or a chain

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
that works with the micro
muscular movements of your hand

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.085 align:middle line:84%
that connect to your
subconscious mind.

00:10:36.085 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've used that before.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.368 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And that
subconscious mind

00:10:38.368 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
is connected to
your intuition and

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:90%
to other spiritual workings.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you can get it to
say yes or no questions, which

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:84%
can become a very
valuable tool if you

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:90%
want to connect with spirits.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever tried
to have somebody control what

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.323 align:middle line:90%
you're holding with their mind?

00:10:55.323 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I haven't
done that, yet.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
let's try something.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.623 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:10:58.623 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.607 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes is up and down.

00:11:00.607 --> 00:11:01.630 align:middle line:90%
No is across.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: OK.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.782 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're
confused, it's middle,

00:11:03.782 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:90%
so mentally think stop.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Now think yes.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Up and down.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Now think no.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.385 align:middle line:90%
Back and forth.

00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:17.185 align:middle line:90%
Back and forth.

00:11:17.185 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Are you happy with
what you've been

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:90%
practicing all these years?

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:90%
So it says yes.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It says yes.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like a
lie detector, isn't it?

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It can be.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the early ways I
was taught how to use this.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:84%
If you were to put this into
a glass, clear your mind

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.983 align:middle line:84%
and focus on what time it is, it
could tap out the closest hour

00:11:42.983 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:90%
to what you're in right now.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was at a
party one day, Kaedrich,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and I pulled out a pendulum,
and I wrote on a piece of paper,

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.420 align:middle line:90%
yes, up, up, no, left, right.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And I had people
come in to do it.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:90%
It was like a party thing.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And this one guy's there
doing it and I'm telling him--

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.890 align:middle line:90%
and his wife's there--

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know why I
said this, but you know,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:84%
he's tuned in, he's
doing yes, yes, no, no--

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and I said, do you ever
have an affair on your wife?

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:90%
And it starts going yes, yes.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:84%
He dropped the pendulum
and walked out of the room.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, boy.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she walked out
with him, not too happy.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.643 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, I bet.

00:12:21.643 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we got to be careful
sometimes when doing that work.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These things
don't lie, do they?

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They tend not to.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:84%
It tends to be what our
micro muscular movements are

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
doing in our hand and what our
subconscious wants to express.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly enough,
the fact that he said yes

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:84%
meant that some
part of his own mind

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
really wanted to
reveal that secret.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it wouldn't have
come through in that way,

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.683 align:middle line:84%
so you actually, in a weird
way, may have helped him out.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, that could be.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you do this, are
you tying into the paranormal

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:90%
at all?

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: The entire time.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there anything
unusual about that?

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.767 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: In fact,
the entire time.

00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
One of my subversive
goals in all of this

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.390 align:middle line:84%
is, I want people to realize
that the paranormal is normal

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and that the supernatural
is perfectly natural.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever I'm using a
pendulum or a black mirror,

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:84%
a Ouija board, or
any of these tools,

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:84%
or even helping people develop
their intuitive connection,

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:90%
it's all paranormal for us.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got video of you
demonstrating, at your studio,

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:90%
some of this.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Excellent.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're here in my
seance room with Paige,

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to demonstrate
a couple of kinetic tools that

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
are very popular
for use in seance.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So a pendulum is a
very simple tool.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just a weight at the
end of a string or a chain,

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
in this case, and
what you want to do

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
is just kind of hold
it a bit and pinch

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
the chain in your
forefinger and your thumb,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and then start to let
it have a good swing.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you start it
with a neutral, say, yes.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Show me what a yes response is.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And then you notice that
it moves differently.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's counterclockwise.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Then we go back to neutral.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.265 align:middle line:90%
And then say, no.

00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:90%
For me, a no is clockwise.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they can start working
with spirits in the room.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Start by asking the
spirits questions.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Ask it some silly
questions, just

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
so that you get used
to being silly with it.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Don't take this too
seriously, by the way.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.580 align:middle line:90%
So your favorite color is blue.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I got a no.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:90%
What did you get?

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I got a yes.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Your favorite color is green.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I got a no.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>> So sent it back to neutral.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But then you can really
start advancing it,

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:84%
like, you were
once a human being.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:90%
I got yes.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I got yes.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Neutral.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.697 align:middle line:84%
And I asked that
question because, a lot

00:14:54.697 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
of times, spirits come through,
never had a physical body.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Then you could start
saying, you are a man.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:90%
I got a yes.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I got a yes.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And then it went
back to neutral.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.430 align:middle line:90%
You died in an accident.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:90%
I got a no.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I got a yes.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And then scan your body.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Like, for me, I
want to scan my body

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:84%
to see if I get a feeling
like, you had a heart problem.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting a yes on that one.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I got a yes.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Now is when the intuition
starts kicking in.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't necessarily
an accident,

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
but it was a mistake
that was made.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Paige and I are communicating
with the same person.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is why it's also
good to do a pendulum.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes with
multiple people, is

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:84%
because when I said accident,
I got yes, Paige got a no.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Turns out, it was a mistake,
a mistake made probably

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:90%
by the doctors.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Some might interpret
that as an accident.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Some might not say
it was an accident.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.112 align:middle line:84%
No matter how many years
I've been doing this,

00:16:07.112 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I still use a pendulum
from time to time.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.290 align:middle line:90%
I still need this check in.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it helps me
to recalibrate my own senses

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:90%
and my own intuitive abilities.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, Paige.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:16:18.917 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kaedrich, Paige
works on "Beyond Belief."

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.375 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Indeed.

00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:22.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:16:22.575 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:90%
And she seemed tuned in.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was
really swinging that.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that done subconsciously?

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Entirely.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely how it works.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And I agree, she's
definitely a natural with it.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
She's got this capability,
and that energy

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.153 align:middle line:84%
that she was picking
up was amazing.

00:16:38.153 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
can get somebody

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:90%
to swing that like that.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, people have used
this by looking at a map--

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:84%
dowsers, for example--
will talk about where's

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:90%
the water, where's the oil?

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.655 align:middle line:84%
And this thing will
go and find them.

00:16:53.655 --> 00:16:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, it's--

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Incredible.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It really is.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the subconscious
tapping into the intuition,

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
tapping into the collective
unconscious, the Earth

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
energy of the field, and then
how it all just gets translated

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.859 align:middle line:84%
to that tiny micro
muscular movement,

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:84%
so that no matter how much you
try to hold your hand still,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.410 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious is going to
move it just ever so slightly.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What gives the
subconscious the knowledge

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:90%
to be right about that?

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I believe it's the
collective unconscious that

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
goes into our intuitive
connection that then translates

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:26.359 align:middle line:84%
to the subconscious
and then can come

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.880 align:middle line:84%
through our imagination,
which is great,

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:84%
or it comes through
the subconscious

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.550 align:middle line:90%
movements of our hand.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
We could use a hand, we
can use dowsing rods.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.170 align:middle line:84%
The muscle test that people
will do, push down your arm

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.500 align:middle line:84%
or try to break the chain
with your fingertips,

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:84%
all of those things
are the subconscious

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
tapping into the
intuition, tapping

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:84%
into the collective
unconscious, or connecting

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:90%
with other beings.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you and she
were doing this separately,

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but it seemed collectively, were
you tapping into some source

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:90%
together?

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
We were working
with the same being.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm still not sure what
happened with the blue

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and the green color, that
difference on the color,

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
but definitely, when the
intuition kicked in--

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's the key
part of the pendulum--

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
is yes, you'll learn how to
do the yes or no questions,

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
but then you'll tap into, like,
what we were doing, scanning

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:84%
the body, feeling where in the
body do I feel the problem was,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, there
was a heart issue.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And then what did we
really mean by accident?

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Was it an accident?

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it was a mistake.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Because suddenly
intuition kicks in.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.275 align:middle line:90%
You get a sense of it.

00:18:25.275 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:90%
You get a feel of it.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.230 align:middle line:90%
You can see what's going on.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
validate that intuition,

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:84%
the intuitive hit
coming in, by going,

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.347 align:middle line:84%
was that really what we were
picking up on or was it not?

00:18:36.347 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll tell
you, yep, your intuition

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:84%
is right on or no, ask
in a different way.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you do
children with the pendulum?

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.187 align:middle line:90%
Can they play with that?

00:18:44.187 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I learned to use the
pendulum as a kid.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're sensitive?

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, definitely.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Kids are more sensitive to the
paranormal than we adults are.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:84%
You've done some work in
the Ouija board area, too,

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:90%
haven't you?

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the next logical
step after the pendulum.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Once you develop your intuition
for yes or no questions

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.463 align:middle line:84%
and how to tap in, then you
can move to the Ouija board

00:19:06.463 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
start learning how

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.910 align:middle line:84%
to spell out more
complex answers,

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:90%
get more complex worded answers.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always thought
the Ouija boards were for evil.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's a
common thing going on,

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and I do see that
around and about,

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and I will say that that's
perpetuated through the TV

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.340 align:middle line:90%
shows and the movies.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the TV shows
are great and the movies

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of fun,
and they present

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
a really believable account
on all of these programs.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's understandable.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
That's their job to make it
look believable and realistic.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the Ouija
board is just a piece

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.760 align:middle line:90%
of wood with some paint on it.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.812 align:middle line:90%
It's just a tool.

00:19:42.812 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And then however
you use that tool.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would think.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you believe
an evil spirit is

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:90%
going to come through, will it?

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Similarities
attract and perpetuate.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.568 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: If you believe
that the Ouija board is

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:56.593 align:middle line:84%
a portal to demons
and evil entities,

00:19:56.593 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and you're sitting there
with it and you're using it

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
with that intention,
100% of the time,

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that's what you're
going to draw to you.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm glad you
didn't bring one in here.

00:20:05.078 --> 00:20:07.652 align:middle line:84%
I don't like Ouija
boards, Kaedrich, at all.

00:20:07.652 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They're a little
bit slow and clunky for me.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:10%
They're not my
preferred tool, but I

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.460 align:middle line:10%
will use it as a
tool to train people,

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:10%
so that they can do seance.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen some people
do some amazing things

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.580 align:middle line:84%
with the Ouija board, where
that planchette is just

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
flying around, giving words
like crazy, so much so

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that somebody that is not
participating with the Ouija

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.400 align:middle line:84%
has to call out or
write down the letters

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.082 align:middle line:90%
because it's moving so fast.

00:20:30.082 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And then the answers
that have been given

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle line:90%
has just been amazing.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've got
video of you playing around

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:90%
with a Ouija board.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.905 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:20:36.905 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
we're going to work with now

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:90%
is the Ouija.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Ouija board has a lot of
negative stereotypes associated

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.160 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:84%
People think that using
Ouija opens a doorway

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:84%
to the dark side, but
I want to assure you

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that a Ouija board is nothing
more than a piece of wood

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.110 align:middle line:90%
with some designs on it.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:84%
If we go into a situation
with fear or worry or concern

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to be
working with negative entities

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.380 align:middle line:84%
or demonic beings or that
sort of thing, then that worry

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:84%
is going to perpetuate
that connection.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But since we're in
sacred space, since we're

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:84%
in a reality where
we are connected

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:84%
with higher-level
beings, they're

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:84%
not going to be a
problem with this.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:84%
In my decades of working
with the paranormal,

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I've only encountered
problems twice.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: And that's it.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.782 align:middle line:84%
Because similarities
attract and perpetuate.

00:21:26.782 --> 00:21:28.240 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a
higher state of mind

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and a higher state
of being, that's

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:90%
what you're going to get.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And so with that
awareness, let's

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
go ahead and put two
fingers on the planchette.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.515 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that
it's us doing it,

00:21:39.515 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
start spinning it,

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:84%
just giving it a little
bit of kinetic energy.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, both of our minds
are working together

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
with the minds of
the spirits here,

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and with the intermediaries
helping to move the planchette.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if their fingers
are on the planchette with us.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's ask some
yes or no questions.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:84%
This room is full of spirits
willing to talk to us.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.835 align:middle line:90%
And the planchette's moving.

00:22:09.835 --> 00:22:10.635 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:22:10.635 --> 00:22:11.835 align:middle line:90%
It's a yes.

00:22:11.835 --> 00:22:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring it to
a neutral again.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking, in specific,
to one spirit right now?

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.122 align:middle line:90%
That's a yes.

00:22:23.122 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And we'll bring
it to neutral again.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Were you once living as
a human being on Earth?

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:37.050 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Is that you, Maria, that's
talking to us today, again?

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.280 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It's Maria.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes, it's Maria.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Maria is a woman
who, in her life,

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:84%
did not believe in
the spirit world,

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:84%
thought this kind of stuff
wasn't the normal thing.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But she came to a
seance here recently

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and introduced herself,
fascinated by the fact

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.010 align:middle line:84%
that she was on the other side
doing seance from that side,

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.510 align:middle line:84%
something that she
didn't believe in

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.927 align:middle line:84%
as something that
she didn't think

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:08.920 align:middle line:90%
existed when she was alive.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.063 align:middle line:84%
So Maria, is your
last name Gallegos?

00:23:13.063 --> 00:23:15.150 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Cool.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.622 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to neutral.

00:23:17.622 --> 00:23:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the things I like

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
to emphasize about
the Ouija and what

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.260 align:middle line:84%
we did is, we used kinetic
tools to make this connection

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and to understand the
connection that was going,

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.872 align:middle line:84%
but as you probably noticed when
you were using the pendulum,

00:23:29.872 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:84%
you were noticing the
yes or no question

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.410 align:middle line:84%
before it really
started to move.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: And so that's perfect.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly how I want people
to learn to use a pendulum is,

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:84%
as you have it in hand and
that you're working with it,

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:84%
you're able to pick up
your yes or no responses

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:90%
before it happens.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:84%
You're tapping into
your intuition.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.310 align:middle line:84%
When you've got that and
you move to the Ouija board

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to
get the yes or no

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and then you start
spelling out, you'll

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:84%
notice that you're starting
to get the psychic impression

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:90%
of what the words already.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.690 align:middle line:84%
You're getting a feeling
already coming through.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:05.271 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the Ouija
board is just slow and clunky.

00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem
to imply, Kaedrich,

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that there were two bad
episodes with a Ouija board.

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I wasn't necessarily
with a Ouija board but it was

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.210 align:middle line:90%
different encounters--

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.595 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --wasn't really
related to that one.

00:24:17.595 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
When I was younger, a
teenager, a group of friends

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and I went out into a
field, exploring, just

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.795 align:middle line:84%
being dumb little teenagers,
let's say it that way.

00:24:25.795 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little kids.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was open, aware,
intuitive because I

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:84%
had the upbringing of
working with spirits

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual reality, and
all of a sudden, something

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:84%
started doing a psychic attack
while we were out there.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:90%
We all were--

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could feel it?

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, we were overcome
with this sense of fear,

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.640 align:middle line:90%
almost like a panic.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
I would kick on my
clairvoyant site

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.240 align:middle line:84%
to see that there were these
entities standing around us,

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:84%
following us, projecting
this energy onto us,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and we ran, as
quick as we could,

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:90%
to get out of that field.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we crossed over
railroad tracks, I stopped.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I got this intuitive insight
from higher beings saying,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:84%
stop, set the boundaries,
call in help, which I did.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:90%
I called in help.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I could see the boundary
forming up in front of us.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:90%
I could feel our guides--

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:84%
other protective
entities-- coming in

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.738 align:middle line:90%
and setting up a boundary wall.

00:25:15.738 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I could see that these other
entities on the other side

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
of the tracks were
like, they were held off

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:90%
for whatever their attack was.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And that taught
me, that day, how

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.870 align:middle line:84%
to call in protective
spirits, how

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to set boundaries to protect
negative entities from coming

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.750 align:middle line:84%
across, and even my friends
at that time were still like,

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.513 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
what this fear was,

00:25:35.513 --> 00:25:37.680 align:middle line:84%
what we were afraid of, but
we were running from it.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to explain to
them and there were still

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:84%
a little bit leery
with my explanation

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.892 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't
quite see what I was seeing

00:25:43.892 --> 00:25:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and experience what
I was experiencing,

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:84%
but they definitely felt
the effects, beforehand

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and afterwards, where
I was like suddenly,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.250 align:middle line:90%
oh, we're not scared anymore.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that feeling
happening anymore to us.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.442 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
know Karen Dahlman?

00:25:56.442 --> 00:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's a
very familiar name.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Loves the Ouija board.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, it's
with her all the time.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:90%
All the time, 24/7.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And I believe she
may have been here.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.622 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, I think I
remember seeing that show.

00:26:11.622 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
She's one of those people
that can use it like really

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.060 align:middle line:90%
well and does it really good.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.643 align:middle line:84%
I don't know her,
personally, but I've

00:26:16.643 --> 00:26:19.200 align:middle line:84%
seen the show and that was
really good stuff that she

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:90%
does with it.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.507 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think
bad entities, though,

00:26:21.507 --> 00:26:22.800 align:middle line:90%
can come through a Ouija board?

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They can.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can?

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But I will say it's
not the Ouija board doing it.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's doing
it, the individual?

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.185 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The
individual using it.

00:26:29.185 --> 00:26:30.480 align:middle line:90%
We, as human beings--

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would anybody want
a bad entity to come through?

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They may not want to.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And here's one of the fun
things about human beings

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.740 align:middle line:84%
is we have our conscious,
everyday mind that we exist

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
with, our everyday
world, thinking

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:90%
that this is who we really are.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.090 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, we have our
deeper unconscious mind

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:84%
that is really connected to
the energies and the spirits

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we get programmed to
believing that a Ouija board is

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.790 align:middle line:84%
evil or that seances are evil
or that the paranormal is evil,

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:84%
then that is what
we start drawing

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.400 align:middle line:84%
to us with an energetic,
subtle language.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.490 align:middle line:84%
We put out that energy out
there and these entities

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.120 align:middle line:84%
will pick up on that
language and go, oh,

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.842 align:middle line:90%
I recognize that energy.

00:27:13.842 --> 00:27:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Let me come into
that one because I

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.190 align:middle line:90%
want more of that energy.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the conscious,
everyday person

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.692 align:middle line:90%
is going, what's happening?

00:27:20.692 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want this to happen.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.860 align:middle line:90%
How is this happening?

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But that energetic part is like,
see, I knew this was happening.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
moving the planchette?

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It is your own muscles.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:90%
It is your own arm.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:90%
It is your own hand.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a reflex?

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%
It is exactly that.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.610 align:middle line:90%
The spirit is coming through.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It is working through
with your body.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:39.930 align:middle line:84%
You can consciously
say, I'm letting

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:84%
go of control of my arm, I'm
letting control of this one,

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately, it's
still your muscles.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.890 align:middle line:90%
It's still your brain moving it.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It is just that
connection with the spirit

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.730 align:middle line:84%
helping move the
planchette around.

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody
is weak-minded,

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Kaedrich, are they more
susceptible to strange things

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:90%
happening with a Ouija board?

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I wouldn't say that
it's necessarily weak-minded.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.802 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about similarities
attract and perpetuate,

00:28:05.802 --> 00:28:07.260 align:middle line:84%
when something
comes through, let's

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.590 align:middle line:84%
say, an attachment or some
sort of a negative entity,

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:13.500 align:middle line:84%
there is an unconscious
agreement going on

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:90%
in the energetic field.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Like, when a spirit
attaches to somebody,

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:84%
they have some common
energy that were there.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Could be even fear
energy, right?

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this entity lives off
of fear, it needs fear energy.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not evil, it just
needs fear energy,

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and this person is
afraid, and this thing

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:84%
is like, oh, hey, there's
a food source for you.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So it comes in, it taps that
person with that fear energy.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.560 align:middle line:84%
That person now
becomes a battery

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's generating that.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And that fear energy comes
back out of this person

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and this entity is like, going,
oh, there's my glass of water.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.250 align:middle line:84%
There's my big steak that
I've been waiting for.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy now.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And then it does its thing,
but it stays attached,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.600 align:middle line:84%
it's a little tendril
to that person.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
lowers its energy

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and it needs another fix, it
pokes that person and then it,

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.360 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS], what's this again?

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And it gets fed and it's like,
great, this is happening.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But like you said,
it's a piece of cardboard.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, a Ouija
board is just a tool.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.810 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on the
individual using it.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How is the
planchette physically made?

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.575 align:middle line:84%
Is it just a little
piece of plastic?

00:29:19.575 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, it's
just a piece of plastic.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With felt on
the bottom or something,

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:90%
because it's smooth, right?

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.128 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, felt
or very smooth bottom.

00:29:26.128 --> 00:29:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they'll have like
ball bearings on the bottom

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.755 align:middle line:90%
so they can move around easily.

00:29:29.755 --> 00:29:31.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just manufactured
by normal human hands.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
recommend kids play around

00:29:33.505 --> 00:29:35.080 align:middle line:90%
with a Ouija board?

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You know, it
really, really depends.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.575 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing
up, in my house,

00:29:40.575 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that was no problem
because I was

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:42.760 align:middle line:90%
trained from a very young age.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.686 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was like a
Monopoly game to you.

00:29:43.686 --> 00:29:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:90%
It was just, it was no problem.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:84%
But if children are in a
home where they are not

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
exposed to the paranormal, and
unfortunately, like we said,

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.013 align:middle line:84%
children are really
attuned to the paranormal,

00:29:55.013 --> 00:29:56.680 align:middle line:84%
but mom and dad may
have been brought up

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.487 align:middle line:84%
to be afraid of the
paranormal, and so

00:29:58.487 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:84%
they're telling the
kid, who's talking

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to their imaginary friend or
having a paranormal connection,

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:90%
stop it.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hear
you doing this one.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.028 align:middle line:84%
And the kid will
suppress that or they'll

00:30:07.028 --> 00:30:09.010 align:middle line:84%
think it's something
scary, and the parents

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:10.960 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to
deal with that energy,

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and then accidentally
could generate

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:90%
some sort of a problem.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a black mirror?

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: A black mirror
is just like it says.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
a piece of glass

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:90%
with paint on the back of it.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.547 align:middle line:84%
You can go to any hobby store
and buy a picture frame,

00:30:24.547 --> 00:30:26.380 align:middle line:84%
take out the little
piece of paper in there,

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:90%
and spray it black.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've got video
of you with a black mirror

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't look like just
a piece of plastic to me.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: [CHUCKLES]

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.700 align:middle line:90%
So I'd like to introduce Ruben.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.518 align:middle line:84%
He has some loved ones
who has passed on,

00:30:38.518 --> 00:30:39.810 align:middle line:90%
that he'd like to connect with.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to use the black
mirror as a tool for connecting

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.197 align:middle line:90%
with those loved ones.

00:30:44.197 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So now that we're here in this
time and space of here and now,

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.405 align:middle line:84%
relaxing and focusing, go ahead
and stare deep into the mirror.

00:30:49.405 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Think of the person you'd
like to connect with.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Think of their name.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Just stare deep into the
mirror, allowing your mind

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:84%
to go even deeper into a memory
that you had with this person.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:10.440 align:middle line:90%


00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's multiple people,
just thinking about them,

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:18.750 align:middle line:84%
feeling what it was like
to be in their presence.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So we open the mirror even
deeper and invite them here.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:25.750 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:31.560 align:middle line:84%
As you're thinking and
feeling about this person,

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.620 align:middle line:84%
just imagine as if
they're here with us now.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.130 align:middle line:90%


00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:84%
If there's something you've
ever wanted to say to them,

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.890 align:middle line:84%
just think it,
loudly in your mind,

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.510 align:middle line:84%
as if you were
talking with them.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting the impression
of a younger person.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>Ruben: My brother
passed away at 23.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>Ruben: And the image
I was remembering

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.620 align:middle line:90%
was when he went to Clearlake.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.505 align:middle line:84%
We went jet skiing
and fishing together.

00:32:00.505 --> 00:32:01.305 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Gotcha.

00:32:01.305 --> 00:32:04.240 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Short hair?

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: Yeah.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: OK.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I almost want to say not
quite blonde but like,

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:90%
lighter colored brown?

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: Mm-hmm.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: OK, great, great.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.622 align:middle line:90%
We're tuning in.

00:32:15.622 --> 00:32:17.080 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't want to
go into the 20s.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.122 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't want to show
me in the age of the 20s.

00:32:19.122 --> 00:32:23.298 align:middle line:84%
He wants to show me in his
teens, something about a party?

00:32:23.298 --> 00:32:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: [CHUCKLES] Yeah.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.820 align:middle line:90%
I threw a huge disco party.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.095 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we had many
parties at the house.

00:32:32.095 --> 00:32:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: [LAUGHS]
Oh, that was weird.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:40.330 align:middle line:84%
He just changed into an
older guy, like, white beard,

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.590 align:middle line:90%
white hair.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:45.620 align:middle line:84%
He knew you as a teacher, as a
mentor in a previous lifetime,

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
but the bond between
you two was so much

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:84%
that, between lives,
you had this agreement

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.630 align:middle line:84%
to come back as brothers,
even though he didn't really

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:90%
need to.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.630 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to spend that
extra time with you

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.982 align:middle line:84%
because of the connection
you had in a previous time.

00:32:57.982 --> 00:33:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said he's sorry that
it was so short this time

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:01.660 align:middle line:90%
but that was all he had.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: Why?

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Why was it cut so short?

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.835 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Because it was always
meant to be that with him.

00:33:05.835 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't supposed to really
be here for this extra time,

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:84%
but he wanted that extra
time to hang out with you.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And so his apology was
that it was so short,

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.358 align:middle line:84%
but that was the only
way it could have been.

00:33:17.358 --> 00:33:19.150 align:middle line:84%
The reason why he gave
you this other shape

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.470 align:middle line:84%
is, he doesn't do
the partying anymore.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:84%
He isn't really the crazy
kid that you knew him as.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.060 align:middle line:84%
He was really this
wiser mentor type,

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and he wants you to now try
to see him as this older guy

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.640 align:middle line:84%
so that he can
actually help give you

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.800 align:middle line:84%
some guidance through
some little turbulence

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.300 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
through right now.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: OK.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:39.018 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: He knows about that.

00:33:39.018 --> 00:33:41.382 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, I
know what Ruben needs

00:33:41.382 --> 00:33:43.090 align:middle line:84%
to do to get through
this one, if he just

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.720 align:middle line:84%
needs to listen to me,
because he did it before,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.883 align:middle line:84%
so he's there to help you
get through that right now.

00:33:49.883 --> 00:33:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Ruben's part of our
production staff

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and our condolences to him
on the loss of his brother.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Indeed.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when
you use the mirror

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:90%
like that, what is it doing?

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.360 align:middle line:90%
How does it connect?

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's another tool
to help alter our mindset.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways I train
people to do it, work with it,

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.315 align:middle line:84%
is we look into the depths of
the blackness of the mirror.

00:34:10.315 --> 00:34:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And you could almost
see the room around you,

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.909 align:middle line:90%
reflected in the mirror.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you shift,
dimensionally,

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.389 align:middle line:84%
to becoming like four
dimensional or five

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:21.580 align:middle line:84%
dimensional, and as you're
working with a mirror

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.900 align:middle line:84%
you will see it changing shapes
and sizes, closer and farther,

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.719 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, everything
will fade to black.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if it
becomes a portal

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.949 align:middle line:84%
to connect with people that you
really want to connect with.

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So I will have people who
want to connect with somebody

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:40.760 align:middle line:84%
in particular, remember a
time that they were together,

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.094 align:middle line:84%
a time when they enjoyed
really being with that person,

00:34:44.094 --> 00:34:45.969 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually
remember what it feels

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:48.130 align:middle line:84%
like to experience
with that person.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.659 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
neat little thing

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:51.739 align:middle line:90%
that we say in our language.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:90%
I was really close to my father.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.449 align:middle line:84%
I was really close
to my brother.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And it implies that there is
this lack of space between us.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, that carries over
to the spiritual realms.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.110 align:middle line:84%
When you're feeling that
closeness to a loved one,

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.200 align:middle line:84%
there is no distance
between you and that spirit.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have a portal,
when the black mirror's

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:14.140 align:middle line:84%
working as a portal, you
close that space between

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and they come into
the room with you

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and then you can share
and communicate together

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.140 align:middle line:84%
using the black
mirror like that.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever see a face
in a black mirror?

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not yours?

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:24.375 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: One of my favorite
experiences with a black mirror

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:31.300 align:middle line:84%
is, I was standing pretty close
to my back against the wall,

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.890 align:middle line:84%
staring deep into
the black mirror,

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:84%
communicating with some spirits,
and then I saw somebody walk

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.640 align:middle line:84%
behind me, in the mirror,
in a dimensional place where

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.940 align:middle line:84%
there couldn't have been
somebody walking behind me.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Automatic
writing, of course,

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.450 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to write
from the spirit world.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:52.750 align:middle line:84%
They're basically almost using
your hand to write things.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.547 align:middle line:84%
We've got some footage of you
teaching Ruben about this.

00:35:55.547 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So what
we're going to do now

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:58.480 align:middle line:90%
is some automatic writing.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a very simple technique
that I teach a lot of people

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to use, and a lot
of people actually

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.710 align:middle line:84%
find they have
proficiency for it.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:09.460 align:middle line:84%
This was something that was used
in the 1800s, early 1900s, as

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.810 align:middle line:84%
one of the primary
means of doing seance,

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and as you'll find out
soon here, you'll see why.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: OK.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So what
I want you to do

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.120 align:middle line:84%
is, at the very top of the
page, write your brother's name

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:20.920 align:middle line:90%
as you know it.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:90%


00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And now, write
yourself a question

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.468 align:middle line:90%
that you'd like an answer to.

00:36:28.468 --> 00:36:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not, it
could even be something like,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.840 align:middle line:90%
what was your favorite food?

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.965 align:middle line:90%
What's your favorite color?

00:36:32.965 --> 00:36:35.020 align:middle line:84%
What was your name in
the previous lifetime?

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.236 align:middle line:90%
Something simple and easy.

00:36:38.236 --> 00:36:40.755 align:middle line:84%
>>Ruben: [CHUCKLES]
It's not so easy.

00:36:40.755 --> 00:36:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's fine.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:47.890 align:middle line:90%


00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, tap into the
feeling, again,

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:84%
of being in the presence
of your brother.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Feel what it's like
to be with him.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Open your mind to see if
you can see an image of him

00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.517 align:middle line:90%
as an older man.

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: It's crazy.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Immediately.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Already saw it.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Beautiful.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Tap into that feeling.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.488 align:middle line:90%
And now, just start writing.

00:37:05.488 --> 00:37:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to write
nonsense, at first,

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.930 align:middle line:84%
like, this is silly,
why am I writing,

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.285 align:middle line:84%
But if something
comes out, beware

00:37:12.285 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that you might be aware of
what you're writing beforehand

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.952 align:middle line:84%
or you might not be, but just
write nonsense right now.

00:37:16.952 --> 00:37:32.550 align:middle line:90%


00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: OK.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Cool.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:90%
That's all you have to do.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>Ruben: I write
the question down,

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and then I just start
writing the answers,

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.480 align:middle line:90%
reading them afterwards.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Just free-associate,
write whatever comes out,

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.360 align:middle line:90%
just like you did now.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: OK.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So the question that
I had for my brother,

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking,
immediately, he--

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I saw him, like, in
a Greek professor,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.070 align:middle line:84%
kind of like, old-school
robes, like, immediately.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what kind
of teacher are you?

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And instead of him
responding, he actually just

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.740 align:middle line:84%
opened up to, like, he
was talking to students,

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and he said, the
people's hearts are

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.080 align:middle line:90%
to be open in this lifetime.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Where and who are you now?

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And it just kind of like, it
just kind of like stopped,

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:25.480 align:middle line:84%
cut right there, and [SIGH]
and it's pretty awesome

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:29.100 align:middle line:84%
because my brother, later
on in life, when he died--

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:90%
he passed away of cancer--

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I could remember him
being in deep meditation.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that he
would say, in so many words.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's awesome.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.066 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad that you were
able to make that connection.

00:38:44.066 --> 00:38:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: Yeah.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's great.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>Ruben: Me too, Kaedrich.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.850 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And it
doesn't stop here.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.898 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
you can take with you

00:38:49.898 --> 00:38:51.500 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.697 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can anybody
practice automatic writing?

00:38:53.697 --> 00:38:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that I really recommend

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.540 align:middle line:90%
everyone give it a shot.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:58.670 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.670 align:middle line:84%
It's very powerful
and very insightful.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:04.880 align:middle line:84%
All it really is just sitting
down with paper and pencil,

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.548 align:middle line:84%
clearing your mind,
if you can connect

00:39:06.548 --> 00:39:08.090 align:middle line:84%
with that sacred
energy, put yourself

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:09.860 align:middle line:90%
into a sacred mind set.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And then really remember
what it's like, again,

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:13.870 align:middle line:90%
that feeling is key.

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:84%
The emotional sense of being
close with that person that you

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.150 align:middle line:84%
loved, that you want to
connect with and communicate

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.197 align:middle line:84%
with, and really feel
that they're with you--

00:39:22.197 --> 00:39:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.447 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --and
closing that space.

00:39:24.447 --> 00:39:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And then write something
on the paper, a question

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.040 align:middle line:90%
that you want answered.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.450 align:middle line:84%
At first, make it simple and
easy and silly because you want

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.340 align:middle line:90%
to get used to the process.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.908 align:middle line:84%
And then just free
associate write.

00:39:35.908 --> 00:39:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, if you want to
do like, roses are red,

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:40.120 align:middle line:84%
violets are blue, I don't
know if this is really

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:40.920 align:middle line:90%
going to work.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:41.837 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:39:41.837 --> 00:39:44.685 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I remember that
one time when we were together.

00:39:44.685 --> 00:39:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
kind of start writing

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:48.297 align:middle line:84%
and let yourself write
whatever comes out.

00:39:48.297 --> 00:39:49.880 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
things that happens

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.838 align:middle line:84%
with automatic writing
is, you're writing along

00:39:51.838 --> 00:39:53.422 align:middle line:84%
and you're writing
and you're writing,

00:39:53.422 --> 00:39:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden the
hand will stop, scratch it out,

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and it'll write down,
please don't write for me,

00:39:57.970 --> 00:39:58.910 align:middle line:90%
I know what I'm doing.

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And it'll just
continue on writing.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a great way for anybody
to reconnect with a loved one.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Connect with higher
self is great.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, what does my higher
self want me to know?

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And you just
free-associate write,

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.560 align:middle line:84%
even if it's starting
off with gibberish,

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a
sudden, your higher self

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.920 align:middle line:84%
will start writing through and
give you answers through it.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Noted author,
Whitley Strieber,

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.980 align:middle line:10%
does automatic writing from
his wife, Ann, who passed away,

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.570 align:middle line:10%
and it's remarkable for him.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.517 align:middle line:90%
He's come up with books--

00:40:26.517 --> 00:40:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --from
the spirit world.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, there
are times where

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I've sat down at a keyboard,
not sure what I want to write.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.732 align:middle line:84%
Something will come
out, next thing I know,

00:40:33.732 --> 00:40:36.325 align:middle line:84%
I've got like a good
chapter for a book,

00:40:36.325 --> 00:40:38.450 align:middle line:84%
or I've got some other
stuff written out that needs

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:39.830 align:middle line:90%
to be published and dealt with.

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:42.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the class ideas I
have that come up that I teach

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.092 align:middle line:84%
start from an automatic
writing session.

00:40:45.092 --> 00:40:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Then I will test it with
some friends and some people

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.425 align:middle line:84%
that I know that are
intuitive, and we'll make sure

00:40:49.425 --> 00:40:50.800 align:middle line:84%
that it works,
tweak it, and then

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.175 align:middle line:84%
I'll bring it out to the public
as like, here's something

00:40:53.175 --> 00:40:55.700 align:middle line:84%
that really came through as
a powerful automatic writing

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.500 align:middle line:90%
teaching.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kaedrich, does
any of this scare you?

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It never really has.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.760 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid,
you know, there's

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.160 align:middle line:84%
been those couple of times
where something negative

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.067 align:middle line:90%
has happened.

00:41:05.067 --> 00:41:06.650 align:middle line:84%
When I've worked
with other people who

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:09.200 align:middle line:84%
have had some scary things
going on in their house,

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and sure, they were scared, but
the first thing that I teach

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.010 align:middle line:84%
everybody, when you think
that you're encountering

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:19.400 align:middle line:84%
some potential negative entity,
like a fear-based entity

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.030 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of a problem
entity, is laugh with it.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if this thing is trying
to tap into some fear energy

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:84%
or try to generate some
negativity out of you,

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.110 align:middle line:84%
it's because it's feeding
off of that energy.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you can just laugh or
you can get into a state of awe

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.160 align:middle line:84%
about this entity, it
raises your vibration,

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:40.910 align:middle line:84%
raises your energy level, it
poisons this thing so that it

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.990 align:middle line:90%
can't mess with you anymore.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And so if I go into a home
where things are flying around,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.200 align:middle line:84%
a book is falling off
the shelf, they've

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.930 align:middle line:84%
got the bad feeling
that goes in the room,

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.990 align:middle line:84%
they got the cold spots, they've
got some sort of negativity,

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I'll teach the person how to
raise their own energy so they

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.870 align:middle line:84%
can take charge of the energetic
environment of their home.

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Makes a difference.

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So that when they
encounter this thing,

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.330 align:middle line:84%
they are now in charge
of the situation.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And what happens, most
of the time-- in fact,

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.680 align:middle line:90%
I would say all of the time--

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:84%
is that there may be some
sort of a negative entity

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.790 align:middle line:84%
like a thought
form or a servitor

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:15.710 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of a
negative entity,

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.470 align:middle line:84%
but it's a secondary
infestation.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, there is really
a spirit in that house

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.650 align:middle line:84%
or a nature spirit or something
that is actually benign,

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.140 align:middle line:84%
something that really wants
to work with this person,

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.990 align:middle line:84%
but because we have been so
trained that the paranormal is

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:33.020 align:middle line:84%
negative, that this must
be a demonic entity,

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:84%
that our own creative ability,
as a powerfully creative

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.130 align:middle line:84%
person, will generate
this negative entity

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.790 align:middle line:90%
or draw this negative entity.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:45.260 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, this benign spirit
is just as fearful and afraid

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.680 align:middle line:10%
of this other entity.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'll teach the person
to get to another mindset,

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.920 align:middle line:84%
to poison this negative
entity away, and then

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.470 align:middle line:84%
come into a more
amicable communication

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:middle line:84%
with a spirit that
really is in their house

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.970 align:middle line:84%
so that they can peacefully
coexist with the paranormal

00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:90%
all around them.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kaedrich, do come
back on "Beyond Belief" again,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.540 align:middle line:90%
would you?

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Any time.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.170 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Thank you.

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The spirit world--

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.610 align:middle line:10%
it's an interesting way to tap
into something that we normally

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:14.420 align:middle line:10%
don't, but I'm still going to
stay away from Ouija boards.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll communicate
a different way.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
