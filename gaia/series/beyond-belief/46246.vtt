people today don't

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.275 align:middle line:90%

>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:10%
You know, as a boy, I was
fascinated by the classic,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:10%
"A Time Machine."

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:10%

course, "Back to the Future,"

We have been just
engulfed in our ability

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:90%
to talk about time travel.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:10%
And on "Beyond Belief" we
talk with physicist Dr. Ronald

Mallet, of course, author
of the bestselling book,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:10%

>>RON MALLET: Oh, thank
you very much, George.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.594 align:middle line:84%
It's finally great to get a
chance to meet you in person.

00:00:58.594 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:84%
You have just given us some
great programs on Coast

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:90%
to Coast.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.103 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Thank you.

00:01:04.103 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You let our
imaginations run wild

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.687 align:middle line:84%
about all these
different possibilities.

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Well, thank you.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember reading
stories about Albert Einstein

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and his quest for time
travel and talking

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:84%
about the speed of
light and all that.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were you always
interested in time travel?

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MALLET: Not always,
as a matter of fact.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:10%
The first 10 years of my life,
I didn't think about time travel

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:10%
at all.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:10%
It had to do, in fact,
with a major disaster that

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:10%
happened in my life.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I was 10
years old, my father he

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:84%
was a radio and television
repairman in the Bronx

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and he fought in
the Second World War

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:90%
as a battlefield medic.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Thing is is that he looked
like a very healthy man.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:90%
He looked robust.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And for me, he
was like Superman.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.522 align:middle line:84%
He was brilliant
and he was handsome.

00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would go on forever.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Right, exactly.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is that
even though he worked hard,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:90%
he had a lot of time for us.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is we didn't
know he had a weak heart.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And he died of a
massive heart attack

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.419 align:middle line:90%
when he was only 33 years old.

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: And the thing is is
that it devastated my life.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I really went from being a
happy child to a depressed kid.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't care
whether I lived or died.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Right, exactly.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Thing is is that he left
me many, many gifts.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And among those was
a love of reading.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And after he died, about
a year after he died,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I came across a book
that changed my life.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it was called "The
Time Machine" by H.G. Wells.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a Classics
Illustrated version of it.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But on the very
first page of it,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:84%
it said that
scientific people know

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
very well that time is
just a kind of space

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and we can move forward
and backward in time just

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:90%
as we can in space.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I read that, it
was like balm to my soul.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:90%
I thought this is it.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
If I can build a
time machine, then I

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.375 align:middle line:84%
can go back to see my
father again and tell him

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:84%
what was going to happen
and maybe change his life.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So that became my
mission in life.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
That's when I really became
interested in time travel.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wow, you were obsessed
with time travel to go back--

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Exactly.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --talk to your
father and say, dad, you

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:90%
got to be healthy.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.151 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do this,
you got to do that.

00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Exactly.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is that
it was a secret mission.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I should say that even
in at 11 years old,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I was astute enough to realize
that people were already

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:84%
worried about me
and if I told them

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to build a time
machine, that might not

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:90%
get the right response.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.710 align:middle line:90%
So I kept it as a secret quest.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:90%
But that was the beginning.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Now you mentioned Einstein.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:90%
In fact, that was the thing.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:90%
I knew this was science fiction.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And I had this fantasy
that it could be done.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And as a child, I
even tried to use

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
the model that was on the
cover of the magazine.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to put
things together

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.982 align:middle line:90%
with my father's old television.

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: His tubes and stuff.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: --and
everything like that.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.384 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
nothing happened.

00:03:44.384 --> 00:03:47.260 align:middle line:84%
But it did say that scientific
people know very well.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So I knew it had something
to do with science.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of years after
that when I was about 12 or 13,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.185 align:middle line:84%
I came across, you might
say, the second book

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:90%
that changed my life.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And the second person.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And this was a book called "the
Universe and Dr. Einstein."

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I picked it up in a
Salvation Army store.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I should mention that
after my father died,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:90%
we plunged into poverty.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Income stream was gone.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Exactly.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But I had this book
habit that I had to feed.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And I picked it up
for about a nickel.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is it had a
picture of Einstein next

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:90%
to an hour class.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So I knew it must
say that Einstein

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.272 align:middle line:90%
had something to do with time.

00:04:21.272 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And even though I
couldn't understand all

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.870 align:middle line:84%
of the articulations
in the book,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I did pick up the fact that
Einstein said that unlike

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:84%
in classical physics,
the physics of Newton,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
in Newton's physics, which
everyone is familiar with,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:90%
time cannot be altered.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Time cannot be changed.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Space cannot be changed.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's revolution was to
say that space and time can

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.120 align:middle line:90%
be altered.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So I knew if I could understand
how that could happen, then

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that would be the key for me
to building a time machine.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.997 align:middle line:84%
So Einstein became
my second obsession.

00:04:52.997 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
the opening for you?

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: That was
the opening for me.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew that that
would provide the science

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:90%
that would be needed for this.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was a long
journey after that,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:90%
but that was the beginning.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you evolved, Ron,
and as you went to school

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and got your degrees and then
became a Ph.D. physicist,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
this quest for time travel,
was it always in there?

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Always there?

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: It was
always in there,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.310 align:middle line:84%
but I still as I went
along, once again,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid to tell
people about it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:84%
As I said, we were poor,
so after high school

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to go
right to college.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So I went into the services,
it was during the Vietnam War

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.829 align:middle line:84%
period, and I used the GI Bill
afterwards to go to college.

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beautiful.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: And so that's
how I was able to go on.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
what it's there for.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Right.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.826 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:05:39.826 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's fascinating.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure, Ron, you
didn't tell your professors,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.130 align:middle line:84%
I want to get a
degree in physics

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.520 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
develop a time machine.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: You're
absolutely right, George,

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
I knew that that
would not be something

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that would be good
for my career path.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is that
Einstein, however, his work

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:84%
led to one of the most
interesting objects

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.505 align:middle line:84%
in the universe which
is a black hole.

00:06:01.505 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew, and it turns out
that black holes affect time,

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:84%
so I knew if I
studied black holes,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
then that would be something
that would be-- in fact,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:84%
physicists consider black
holes as being crazy.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.200 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.517 align:middle line:10%
But they're legitimate crazy.

00:06:16.517 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:10%
>>MALLET: Whereas time travel
was considered was crazy crazy.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.360 align:middle line:10%
So if I studied black holes and
used that as my cover story,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:10%
then I felt I was safe.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.541 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I did.

00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:28.704 align:middle line:84%
I built my career on
studying black holes.

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
know, there's so much

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:90%
going on in this universe.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Or should we say
the multiverses now.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
we're still trying

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to figure out the
Big Bang theory.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
We're still trying to figure
out so many different facets

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.040 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I guess by adding the ingredient
in of time travel, that's just

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
as possible as all these other
things that are out there.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: Yeah, well,
as a matter of fact,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
it's even more possible
because we actually

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.150 align:middle line:84%
have Einstein's
theories which allow

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
us to see the real
possibilities of time travel.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean one of the things
that Einstein developed,

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:90%
two major theories.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:84%
One was called the special
theory of relativity

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and the other is the general
theory of relativity.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And the special theory of
relativity, in a nutshell,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with
light and time.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And what Einstein said was
that because the speed of light

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.685 align:middle line:84%
cannot be changed no matter
how fast you move towards it

00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:84%
or away from it, other objects,
you can't change the speed

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
by going towards it or away from
it, but with light it doesn't.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein said the only
way that that can happen

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:84%
is if time slows down
the faster you move.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Now you might say,
has this been shown?

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, not
only has it been shown,

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
but it's been shown
many, many times.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Both on the macroscopic level
and the microscopic level.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a very
important experiment

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:84%
that was done back in 1971
at the Naval Observatory.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And what this
experiment involved

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:84%
was having two atomic
clocks, which as you know,

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.610 align:middle line:84%
are the most precise time
keeping mechanisms we have.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They put one of the clocks on
board an ordinary passenger

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:90%
jet.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:84%
They kept the other clock at
rest at Naval Observatory.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:84%
They flew the passenger jet
around the world at close

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:90%
to the speed of sound.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:84%
When they bought
it back, they found

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
that the clock on the passenger
jet had actually slowed down.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
shouldn't have, right?

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: According to
standard old theory of Newton,

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:90%
it shouldn't have.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But according to
Einstein's theory--

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It should have.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.615 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: It should have.

00:08:30.615 --> 00:08:33.309 align:middle line:84%
So it proved that
Einstein was right.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, when I'm talking
about time, and a clock,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about just
simply a mechanical mechanism.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Your heart rate, your
metabolism, they're clocks.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:84%
This means that the
faster you move,

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.691 align:middle line:84%
the more your heart
rate slows down.

00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:90%
So you don't age the same way.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:84%
That means that
those physicists--

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything slows down.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: --everything
slows down, exactly.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's where time
travel comes in.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing
is is that, in fact,

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.360 align:middle line:84%
this is the way you
see it in a movie.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Someone gets into a device,
a fast moving rocket

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Time slows down for them.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.224 align:middle line:84%
They don't notice it, but
everyone else sees them--

00:09:07.224 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's changed.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: --change.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:09.150 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And when they come back, they
may only be a few years older,

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:84%
whereas, decades or
centuries may have passed.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may not even
have a planet to come back to.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: Well, in fact,
or an altered planet.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
one of the movies

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:84%
that got it right was "Planet
of the Apes" because of the fact

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that what they did
was they didn't

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
realize they had gone through
space so fast that they

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.194 align:middle line:84%
had arrived at earth
at a different period.

00:09:34.194 --> 00:09:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.818 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: And that's
what happened in it.

00:09:36.818 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So that shows that real
time travel can happen.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I should mention that the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN, which

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.170 align:middle line:84%
they use to accelerate
subatomic particles, many

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
of the subatomic
particles can only

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:84%
live for a millionth
of a second and they

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:90%
completely disintegrate.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:84%
But now, according to
Einstein, the faster

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.570 align:middle line:90%
these subatomic particles move.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.760 align:middle line:84%
the more their clock
would slow down.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:90%
So they would live longer.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And every time they
turn that machine on,

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
they're able to get subatomic
particles living 20 to 30

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
times longer than
they normally would.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
If that happened
for human beings,

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
if we could-- and
remember, I mentioned

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
that this effect
depends on speed.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And if we would
see it drastically.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Now in the experiment I was
talking about at the Naval

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Observatory, it was only
by fractions of a second.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Because they were traveling
at the speed of sound.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might say that's pretty
fast, but compared to light,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:90%
it's slow.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to give you an
example, the speed of sound

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:84%
is about 720 miles per hour,
whereas the speed of light

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.957 align:middle line:90%
is 186,000 miles per second.

00:10:39.957 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Per second.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Big difference.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Exactly.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And to put that
into perspective,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:84%
we use mach numbers to talk
about the speed of sound.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So mach 1 is one times
the speed of sound.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Mach 2 is two times.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Mach 3 is-- OK, we
have passenger jets

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:90%
that can do mach 1.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.870 align:middle line:84%
We have fighter jets
that can do mach 2.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:84%
We even have stealth
fighters that can do mach 3.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Three times the speed of sound.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's put the speed of
light into mach numbers.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that light
travels at mach one million.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.015 align:middle line:90%
That means--

00:11:11.015 --> 00:11:11.556 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:11:11.556 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:90%
Look at the difference.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.925 align:middle line:10%
>>MALLET: You
know, so that means

00:11:13.925 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:10%
that as far as
sound is concerned,

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:10%
it's standing still compared
to the speed of light.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:10%
When we have rockets that can
go close to the speed of light,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:10%
we'll see the sort of thing
that we see in the accelerators.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
That is to say that a person
traveling out in space going

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.020 align:middle line:84%
close to the speed of
light, when they come back,

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.610 align:middle line:84%
maybe only a few years
have passed for them.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But because their metabolism
and heart rate have slowed down,

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.610 align:middle line:90%
decades could pass.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And if they have a
family, that could--

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: --have
the strange effect

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.233 align:middle line:84%
of coming back and
finding out they're

00:11:46.233 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:84%
younger than their
children or grandchildren.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.938 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:11:48.938 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Their little boy may be an
adult with his own kids.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.098 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: That's right.

00:11:52.098 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not sure
I'd want to do that.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Now that's talking about
going into the future.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: That's
right, that's right.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want to
go back into the past.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: That's right.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How's that possible?

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: OK.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Very good point, George.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is
that with respect

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:84%
to the special
theory of relativity,

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:90%
it's only a one-way journey.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:90%
You can only go forward.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's no speed
that you can use even up

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:84%
to the speed of light that will
take you back into the past.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.030 align:middle line:84%
The speed of light is
the ultimate speed limit

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:90%
for the universe.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:84%
It turns out,
however, that Einstein

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:90%
developed a second theory.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And this was called his
general theory of relativity,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and it was developed
10 years afterwards.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
The reason why he developed this
theory was because of the fact

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to apply
this principle of relativity

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:90%
to all the forces of nature.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And all of them abated
except for gravity.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
That is to say that
according to Newton,

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:90%
gravity travels instantaneously.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:84%
It travels even faster
than the speed of light.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And that led to a weird paradox,
because what it would imply

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:90%
is a simple example.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's suppose that we think
about the sun and the earth.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:84%
The earth is
orbiting from the sun

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:90%
about 93 million miles away.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.199 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Taking a
year to go through it.

00:13:07.199 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Right, exactly.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Now what would happen if a
cosmic catastrophe occurred

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.360 align:middle line:90%
and destroyed the sun?

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:90%
What will we see?

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Now it's important to note
when I say, what will we see,

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:84%
it takes since we're 93 million
miles away from the sun,

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:84%
it takes eight minutes for
light to get from the sun

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.677 align:middle line:90%
to the earth.

00:13:24.677 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We wouldn't
know for eight minutes.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.769 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Exactly, exactly.

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
You know it's also strange
to think that we never

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.170 align:middle line:84%
see the sun the
way that it is now.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:84%
We only see the sun,
throughout our whole life,

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
the way that it was
eight minutes ago.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eight minutes ago.

00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: But
according to Newton,

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:84%
as soon as the
sun was destroyed,

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.860 align:middle line:84%
gravity would shut
down immediately.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So we would have this weird
effect of still seeing

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.404 align:middle line:84%
the sun in the sky,
but, due to the fact

00:13:49.404 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that gravity's
shut down, we would

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:90%
be hurtling off into space.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.197 align:middle line:10%
Einstein said that can't
happen, that gravity

00:13:55.197 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:10%
could travel faster
than the speed of light.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.892 align:middle line:10%
So he developed a second theory
called the general theory

00:13:59.892 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:10%
of relativity,
which is essentially

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:10%
his theory of gravity.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.322 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he did
this without a computer.

00:14:04.322 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: That's right.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:90%
He did it without a computer.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I should mention
without grant money.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:84%
He was a theoretical
physicists and his laboratory

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:90%
was all in his head.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
But what he did was to
develop a whole new way

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:84%
of looking at gravity which says
gravity is not really a force.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Gravity is actually
a property of space.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
A simple way that I
like to tell people

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.060 align:middle line:84%
that you can visualize
that is think of space

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:90%
as being like a rubber sheet.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Like a little trampoline,
if you can imagine that.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.991 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that you put a
bowling ball on that rubber

00:14:37.991 --> 00:14:38.490 align:middle line:90%
sheet.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it kind of
pulls in a little, right?

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Right, exactly.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing is, suppose you
put a marble on that rubber

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:90%
sheet.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It'll
all roll right in.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: You got it.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Now suppose the
rubber sheet's there,

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:90%
but you make it transparent.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's there,
but all you see is

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.590 align:middle line:90%
the bowling ball and the marble.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you put
the marble there,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:84%
the marble starts moving
towards the bowling ball.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:10%
You would say, oh, somehow the
bowling ball is pulling them.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.310 align:middle line:10%
But you know that's not
what's really happening.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:84%
That, in fact, the
bowling ball is just

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:90%
curving the rubber sheet.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what Einstein
said the sun is doing.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.240 align:middle line:84%
The sun is actually
curving empty space.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.010 align:middle line:90%
We can't see it, OK?

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:10%
But it's curving empty space
in exactly that same way.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:10%
And the earth is
like that marble.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately for us, when the
solar system was created,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.824 align:middle line:10%
the earth had a little
bit of a sideways motion.

00:15:27.824 --> 00:15:29.490 align:middle line:84%
If it had just simply
been placed there,

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:84%
the Earth would move
towards the sun.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Just like the marble.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you go back
to the analogy with the rubber

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.624 align:middle line:84%
sheet and the bowling ball,
if you take the marble

00:15:40.624 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and you give the marble a
little bit of a sideways motion,

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.970 align:middle line:90%
it will actually go around.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Just like it'll orbit it.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a skater
on a roller derby rink.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So for Einstein,
gravity is not a force.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.600 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
property of space.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But what this means, however,
is that it solved the problem.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.981 align:middle line:84%
Because let's go back
to the bowling ball.

00:16:01.981 --> 00:16:03.980 align:middle line:84%
If I take the bowling
ball off the rubber sheet,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen?

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The sheet
should go back up, right?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Right, exactly.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.443 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
take time for the effect

00:16:08.443 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:90%
to go out to the marble.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the sun
were destroyed, space

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.410 align:middle line:84%
would be elastic
in that same way.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
The vibration of space,
which we now remember

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:84%
is a vibration of
gravity, if you calculate

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.680 align:middle line:84%
that, it takes eight
minutes for that vibration

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:90%
to get out to the earth, OK?

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So if it's any consolation, if
we-- if our sun were destroyed,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
it would take eight
minutes not only

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
for us to see the light
go out, but for us

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:90%
to hurl off into space.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So that was Einstein's
major contribution.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Now it turns out that the
bending of space and time

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
is the key to what
I was interested in.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Because it turns out
that not only can you use

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
gravity to affect space, but
you can affect time in a way

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:84%
that you could actually
twist time into a loop.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And this would allow
you the possibility

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:90%
of going back into the past.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you build a
machine to be able to do this?

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: As a matter of
fact, the work that I do,

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.198 align:middle line:84%
and I should mention
again that I'm

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.260 align:middle line:84%
a theoretical physicist
like Einstein.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And physics, unlike the
other areas of science,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.920 align:middle line:84%
has a very precise
division of labor

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.480 align:middle line:84%
between theoretical and
experimental physics.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:84%
Theoretical physicists
use equations

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and build mathematical models to
try to understand the universe.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Experimental physicists
actually build the equipment

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.229 align:middle line:90%
to see if the universe does--

00:17:32.229 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: See if it works.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Right, exactly.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I developed
was a mathematical model

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.580 align:middle line:84%
based on Einstein's
theories in which I

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:84%
was able to show that
space and time can

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:90%
be altered by using light.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Now it's interesting
because in Newton's theory,

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
light cannot affect matter
with a gravitational force.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that can affect--
matter can affect matter.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Like the Earth can pull us down
and the sun keeps us in orbit.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.430 align:middle line:84%
But in Einstein's theory,
light can also create gravity.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing is is
that it turns out,

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and I should mention that
gravity can affect time.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.870 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that I didn't mention.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I should mention because
in special relativity,

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:90%
speed is what affects time.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.050 align:middle line:84%
In Einstein's general
theory of relativity,

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:84%
it's actually gravity
that can affect time

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and what Einstein showed was
that the stronger gravity is,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.490 align:middle line:90%
the more time will slow down.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So for example, a clock here
at the surface of the earth

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:84%
will actually run slower than
a clock at a higher altitude

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.174 align:middle line:90%
according to Einstein.

00:18:43.174 --> 00:18:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because of gravity.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Because of gravity.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.925 align:middle line:84%
Now you might say, has this been
something that's demonstrated?

00:18:47.925 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Not only has it
been demonstrated,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:84%
it's actually something that's
part of our ordinary life.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't realize
this, but the GPS system

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.160 align:middle line:84%
works because of
Einstein's theory.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that right now,
12,000 miles above us,

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:84%
there are 24 satellites
that are in orbit.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Three satellites cover
a particular portion

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:90%
of the earth, OK?

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Now the way in which
the GPS system works

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
there are clocks

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.250 align:middle line:84%
on board those satellites and
there's a clock in your unit.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
The satellite sends a
signal at a certain time

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
which reaches your
unit at a certain time.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Now in physics, it's a
very simple relationship

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.860 align:middle line:84%
between distance,
speed, and time.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
If you know any two of these,
you can determine the other.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.867 align:middle line:84%
So if you know the time, in this
case, the time that the signal

00:19:41.867 --> 00:19:43.450 align:middle line:84%
was sent by the
satellite and the time

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:90%
that it reaches your unit, OK?

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And you know the speed,
which is the speed of light,

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:90%
you can compute distance.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:90%
That's how the GPS system works.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
However, when they
first set it up,

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.800 align:middle line:84%
it was giving incorrect
locations all over the place.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And what they had
forgotten was they

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:84%
hadn't taken into
account initially

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Einstein's theory of gravity.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it turns out that the
unit, the clock in your unit,

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:90%
in your car--

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems like it would
have been simple to figure out,

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: Right, well,
but that's the thing.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:84%
In Newton's theory, time
can't be affected by gravity.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And so when the engineers
were setting it up--

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They went by Newton.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: They went
by-- you got it.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:90%
They went by Newton.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:90%
So the--

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.664 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I did well in
physics, by the way.

00:20:24.664 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: In fact,
it's very clear

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.700 align:middle line:84%
that you did, as
a matter of fact.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But they went by
Newton which said

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.524 align:middle line:84%
that time isn't
affected by gravity.

00:20:33.524 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is
is that it wasn't

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:84%
until when they were
consulting with the physicists

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.608 align:middle line:84%
that the physicists
said, well, you know,

00:20:38.608 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
you have to use
Einstein's theory

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:84%
because time is
affected by gravity.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So the time in your car is not
the same as the time on board

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:90%
those satellites.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
have to use computers

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to calibrate the
system to make sure

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:90%
that they're staying in sync.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So do
you think 10 years

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:84%
from now, 20 years from now, 100
years from now we are literally

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:05.150 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to go into
the future or into the past?

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Oh, yes.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean going into the future
is already, as I said,

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:90%
a possibility.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But going into the
past, yes, because it's

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.710 align:middle line:90%
based on real physics.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean the thing is is that
in Einstein's general theory

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.720 align:middle line:84%
of relativity that's
a possibility.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.224 align:middle line:10%
Now I'll show you why
going into the past--

00:21:21.224 --> 00:21:22.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We could go
back and see Jesus,

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.720 align:middle line:10%
we can go back and
see your father.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Well--

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
capture events that--

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: That's going
to be a possibility,

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.610 align:middle line:90%
but not in a simple way.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's going to be
something that might involve,

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
even though it sounds
science fiction, going back

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.664 align:middle line:84%
in our distant past might
involve extraterrestrial.

00:21:44.664 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.455 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:46.455 --> 00:21:47.850 align:middle line:90%
But I'll come to that.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: But the thing
is is that because there's

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:84%
a limitation to what it is that
you can do in traveling back

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:84%
into the past, the thing
is is that remember

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:84%
that I said that in Newton's
theory, the only thing that

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:84%
can affect gravity, can
create gravity, is matter.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:84%
In Einstein's theory, not only
can matter create gravity,

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:84%
but light can
create gravity, too.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually where
my breakthrough came in.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think you can actually
see the logic in it.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.814 align:middle line:90%
Gravity can affect time.

00:22:23.814 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a big way.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Right.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:90%
Light can create gravity.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, light
can affect time.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.268 align:middle line:84%
That was my
breakthrough to realize

00:22:35.268 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:84%
that you could use light
to manipulate time.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:90%
To control time.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:84%
The thing is is that in
a special type of light,

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
laser light, what I was able to
show in the mathematical model

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:84%
was that by using the
circulating beam of laser

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:84%
light, and there's a device that
can create a circulating light,

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.750 align:middle line:90%
it's called a ring laser.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.925 align:middle line:84%
But actually you can
create it by simply--

00:22:58.925 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just going around.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: Right, it's
just getting light

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.087 align:middle line:90%
to go around and around.

00:23:02.087 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number
of different ways

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:84%
that you can do that, but
the thing is, however,

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that causes an effect
on empty space.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
That actually causes-- the
circulating light actually

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:90%
causes a twisting of space.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember, in Einstein's theory,
space acts like a medium.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.649 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
built one of these?

00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:20.832 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Well, mathematically.

00:23:20.832 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, but let me
demonstrate to you exactly--

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.081 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, sure.

00:23:24.081 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: --how this, by
analogy, how this would work.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Now think of the coffee in this
cup as being like empty space.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And think of the spoon as being
like the circulating light

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:90%
beam.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens to
the coffee as I stir?

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.006 align:middle line:84%
The coffee starts
to swirl around.

00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:45.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
circulating light

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.749 align:middle line:90%
beam is doing to empty space.

00:23:47.749 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
But now you might say,
well, wait a minute.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:84%
If it's empty space, how am
I going to see this effect?

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the case of
the coffee, suppose

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:84%
that I have something
like a simple wood chip.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
drop it in there.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: And I
drop it in there.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
If I take this and
I stir the coffee,

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:84%
look what happens
to the wood chip.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's swirling around.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: Right and the
coffee is causing that to--

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still spinning.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Right, exactly.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing that would play
the role in the real experiment

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:84%
of the wood chip would
be a subatomic particle

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.920 align:middle line:84%
that's a part of every
atom, the neutron.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can CERN do that?

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: It's interesting.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
They could if they wanted to set
up that kind of an experiment.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But the type of experiment,
I mean one of the places

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:84%
in this country that
would actually do it

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:84%
is the National Institutes
of Standards and Technology

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:90%
in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They actually have a
neutron facility there.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I visited
there back in January

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.010 align:middle line:84%
with one of my Ph.D.
graduate students

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:84%
to look at their
neutron facility

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and to talk with them about the
possibility of actually doing

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:57.200 align:middle line:90%
this type of experiment.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
be a great experiment.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Exactly.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So the thing would be
to use these neutrons

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and to have a circulating
beam of light twisting space

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and then, if you put
the neutron in there,

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.954 align:middle line:84%
you would actually see the
neu-- even though you couldn't

00:25:08.954 --> 00:25:12.105 align:middle line:84%
see the space, the space would
be dragging the neutron around.

00:25:12.105 --> 00:25:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So you knew that the empty space
was actually doing something.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
interested in learning more

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:84%
about what it is that
we're trying to do.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be looking
at the possibility of perhaps

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:84%
collaborating with them to
see this particular effect.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Now what's important
here is the fact

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that in Einstein's
theory, space and time

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.400 align:middle line:90%
are connected to each other.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is you do to
space also happens to time.

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simultaneously.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Now that's critical.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Right, well, the thing
is is that I should

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.210 align:middle line:84%
say that it happens,
but it happens

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
if you twist space
strongly enough.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.700 align:middle line:84%
In other words, at
low swirls, you only

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.830 align:middle line:90%
get the twist in the space.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:53.820 align:middle line:90%
But if you twist space--

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fast enough.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Fast enough.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Or I should say strongly enough.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.000 align:middle line:84%
If you twist space
strongly enough,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:90%
the following thing will happen.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's suppose that I
represent a timeline

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:90%
on this sheet of paper.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:12.450 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going
to draw is a line

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:84%
that represents our
lifeline, if you will.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.621 align:middle line:90%
And this lifeline is a timeline.

00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:23.870 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom of this line,
I'm going to put the past.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:24.759 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: At the
middle of this line,

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.061 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to put the present.

00:26:29.061 --> 00:26:31.435 align:middle line:84%
And at the top of this line,
I'm going to put the future.

00:26:31.435 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:34.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Now even though we're not
consciously aware of us,

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:84%
all of us throughout
our life are

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.760 align:middle line:84%
moving from the past whatever
it was you were doing yesterday

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:84%
to the present,
here, to the future.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.780 align:middle line:90%
This is what we are all doing.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But now, and this is the
really interesting thing,

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.170 align:middle line:84%
if you twist space
strongly enough,

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.830 align:middle line:84%
then what's going
to eventually happen

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.090 align:middle line:84%
is that the straight
line of time

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.230 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
twisted into a loop.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Now look what this implies.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:84%
You start out at the past,
you move along the timeline

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.250 align:middle line:84%
to the present, you
continue along the timeline

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to the future, but I've
made time into a loop.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It keeps going.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MALLET: I can go from the
future, back to the past.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So by twisting space, I
can twist time into a loop

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and by doing that, it allows
me to time travel to the past.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:90%
That was my--

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some civilization that
might be a million years ahead

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.576 align:middle line:84%
of us, they have got to
have perfected this by now.

00:27:39.576 --> 00:27:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: I agree with you.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.658 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, this is
where the point-- because

00:27:42.658 --> 00:27:43.640 align:middle line:90%
remember what I said.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:84%
That when you turn a
device on, OK, that's

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.010 align:middle line:84%
when space and time
starts getting twisted.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
So if I turned it on
today and I left it on,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:84%
let's say, for 10 years, then
someone could send information

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.950 align:middle line:84%
back or travel back seven years,
five years, all the way back

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.290 align:middle line:84%
to the point that the
device was turned on.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But they can't go earlier
than that because of the fact

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.100 align:middle line:84%
that there was no device
earlier than that.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:84%
That means that--
and it doesn't matter

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.690 align:middle line:84%
what particular
mechanism that you use,

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean I'm using light.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.110 align:middle line:90%
That was my major breakthrough.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
But any other way in
which you would do it,

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
it would be the device
that's causing the effect.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.035 align:middle line:84%
That means that since
we haven't develop it.

00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:23.660 align:middle line:10%
And, in fact, this
answers the question

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.930 align:middle line:10%
that sometimes people ask,
well, if time travel to the past

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:10%
is possible, how come we
don't have time travel

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.620 align:middle line:10%
tours all over the place?

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.950 align:middle line:10%
What that just simply says is
that the first human scale time

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.290 align:middle line:10%
machine hasn't been invented.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hasn't been invented.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MALLET: Exactly, in fact--

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ron, I
want to thank you
