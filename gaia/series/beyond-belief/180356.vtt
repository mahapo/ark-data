00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.885 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory,
and what you're

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:10%
about to hear on this program
may upset you, may terrify you,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:10%
may frighten you.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.790 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Judy Wood, a former
mechanical engineer

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:10%
and author of "Where
Did the Towers Go?",

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:10%
has been looking at this tragedy
since it occurred back in 2001.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:10%
But something else
may have happened,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:10%
and Dr. Judy Wood is
with us to explain.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.875 align:middle line:10%
Judy, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:52.570 align:middle line:10%
>>JUDY WOOD: Well, thank you
so much for having me here.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When this
happened, this tragedy,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
I was at home and my
daughter called me and said--

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Dad, Dad, turn on
the television!

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:84%
You won't believe
what I'm looking at!

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And the first plane had
already hit one of the towers,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and I was watching as
so many others were

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:84%
when the second plane
hit another tower.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:90%
But you saw something else.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.145 align:middle line:90%
What happened that day for you?

00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Well, what I saw--

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.350 align:middle line:10%
I went into the faculty
conference room,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.520 align:middle line:10%
and they had the TV on.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:10%
They were showing repeatedly,
over and over again,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.040 align:middle line:10%
these towers frothing
up into dust.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around
the room like, you guys

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:90%
aren't buying this, are you?

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And they looked over
like, what kind of a idiot

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:90%
did we, you know, hire here?

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:10%
They were already
sucked into it.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:84%
That was the most uncomfortable
feeling of my life.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.847 align:middle line:90%
Am I insane?

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Or is the rest the world insane?

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And that's actually
a sane question to ask.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
remember interviewing you

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:84%
on "Coast to Coast,"
and we field phone calls

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:90%
from listeners.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, we
saw the planes hit--

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.230 align:middle line:90%
what is Judy saying?

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:10%
What is she-- and
then all of a sudden,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:10%
I stepped back a
little bit to look

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:10%
at some of the other
anomalies that had occurred.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:10%
You know, a pristine passport
of one of the hijackers

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.479 align:middle line:10%
just found in a
rubble of pictures

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:10%
we're going to see a little bit
later on in the program, where

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.270 align:middle line:10%
there's no way you could have a
pristine passport sitting there

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:10%
on the dust.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Something else is going on here.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And then subsequently,
Judy, even to today,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
what we've done in the Middle
East, and our involvement still

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
in Afghanistan, in
Iraq, and God knows

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:90%
where else, it hasn't stopped.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And now that we know
about the deep state

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and what they may be up to,
you then put all the pieces

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:90%
together, and you realize--

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe Dr. Judy Wood isn't
insane (CHUCKLING) after all.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Was it difficult for you
during that time period

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.917 align:middle line:84%
to continue with your
theory that we're going

00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:90%
to talk about today?

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.083 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Oh, it wasn't a theory--

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.420 align:middle line:10%
just looking at evidence.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:10%
And so I would look at
things I could actually

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:10%
calculate, like how long it
took the building to go away.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And if I--

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:84%
this one, huge thing I
discovered with my colleagues--

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.210 align:middle line:84%
if I showed them my calculations
as for how long it would take

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
the building just to
fall to the ground,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't handle that.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:10%
I could see-- you know,
it was falling bodies,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.450 align:middle line:10%
horrors seen, and they
were just traumatized.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Then I got this idea of
using innocent billiard balls

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:90%
for timing devices.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So we just dropped
those out the window.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, now they're following
it, and they're evaluating it

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:90%
like it's a dynamics problem.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:10%
And they come up with
the right answer.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they ever get
to a point where they said--

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
we understand what
she's saying now.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:90%
We get it.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: I developed this
billiard ball example,

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:10%
you know, about just look
at innocent billiard balls

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:10%
as timing devices of how
long it would take them

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:10%
to fall from different windows.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And folks would follow
me to the end with that.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:10%
And then I moved it back
to the World Trade Center,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:10%
and they were
painted into a corner

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:10%
they couldn't get out of.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:10%
Some could handle
it, some couldn't.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:10%
It was just too
stressful, and they just

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:10%
never wanted to talk
about that subject again.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:90%
It was just terrifying.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.201 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a horrible day.

00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:84%
It was probably one of
the most horrible days

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:90%
I think I've ever encountered.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And it
was very traumatic

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.329 align:middle line:90%
if you took it in emotionally.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:10%
If you put on your
Spock persona--

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --and just looked at the
facts-- just the facts, ma'am--

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:90%
and looked at those.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:10%
But then how to get
people to do that?

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.357 align:middle line:84%
Because the way it was
presented was very emotional.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was emotional.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:90%
It was dramatic.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:90%
It was compelling.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And it was live television.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:90%
And we saw that.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
But then later on, people
who were in the know

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
or who are reasonable
would say--

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, one tower
collapsing from a plane?

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:90%
But two?

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And then another one,
Building 7, when it was really

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:90%
not even hit by a plane?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some debris fell on it,
but buildings just don't fall.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:84%
At what point did you
realize to yourself

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
there's a bigger
story going on here?

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.510 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: When I realized it's
not just one building, or two

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:10%
buildings, or three buildings.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:10%
All seven buildings
that have a WTC prefix

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:10%
were destroyed that day.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:90%
All seven.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All seven of them.

00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: WTC 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost in unison too.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Exactly.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And very much in
similar ways too.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.915 align:middle line:84%
Building 6-- it
looked like, you know,

00:05:38.915 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
a cookie cutter took out the
center core of the building.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Just went away.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:84%
One poor firefighter
had a friend

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
who was right-- he
was walking with who

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
was on the wrong
side of the division.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:90%
He came out OK.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:90%
His friend was gone.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I want everybody
to know while they're watching

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.420 align:middle line:84%
this program, Judy, is the
compassion that you've had

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.410 align:middle line:84%
for the 3,000-some people who
died on that horrible day.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:10%
This is not a program
that diverts the fact

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:10%
that these poor people didn't
die, and didn't die tragically.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.430 align:middle line:10%
This is a program trying to get
to the truth on what happened

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:10%
to make this tragedy occur.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And I want people
to understand that.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Because knowing you
over these years,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.380 align:middle line:84%
you're a very
compassionate person.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Like there's several
of the first responders

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:10%
I sort of became attached
to through their stories

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:10%
and what they're experiencing,
as well as some of the victims

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:10%
that I homed in on.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:10%
And like the fellow hanging,
dangling by one hand and one

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.310 align:middle line:10%
foot from the 105th
floor, and I'm thinking--

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:10%
he needs his story told.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:10%
I'm putting myself
in his position.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
He knows he's facing
his own death,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
but he wants the rest of the
world to know what went on

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And I made
a promise to him.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you
really don't dwell on

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.730 align:middle line:90%
the planes itself.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:84%
But were the planes used as
the image, the scope of what

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:84%
happened, where the real
damage was done by the ability

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.470 align:middle line:84%
to pulverize these
buildings electronically?

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Well, I
believe there were

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:10%
planes that took off that day.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:10%
Where they went, we don't know.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:10%
But they can't turn buildings
into powder in midair.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And so all they do is
suck in your emotion.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's terrible
what happened,

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:84%
but we're not going
to get to the answer

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
when we get pulled
in emotionally.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to
separate those two things.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're real or
fake, it doesn't matter.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to argue about it.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:84%
That real planes cannot turn
buildings into dust in midair

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:90%
and neither can fake planes.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:10%
So the planes aren't an issue--

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.720 align:middle line:10%
that something turned
the buildings into powder

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:10%
in midair.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.537 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, I see
apartment fires on the news,

00:07:59.537 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and they're burning, and they're
burning, and they're burning.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But the buildings
don't collapse.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
You'll see scorches outside the
window and things like that,

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:84%
or a couple of damaged
floors, but the building

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:90%
is still intact.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:90%
These all went down.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.130 align:middle line:90%
All of them!

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Not necessarily down.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Some of it went up in dust.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:10%
It went up into the upper
part of the atmosphere.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:10%
It was mainly turned to dust.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:84%
There was some solids, but most
of the building turned to dust.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you got
into researching this,

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
was there an "Oh, my God"
moment for you when you went--

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
this is happening?

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: My first
thing on that day

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:90%
was, where'd the buildings go?

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Why is no one asking that?

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:84%
You see everything
at ground level.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was just about 25
hours later, Peter Jennings

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
in the studio was asking George
Stephanopoulos at the scene--

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:84%
George, folks, Jackie
Judd and several others

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.380 align:middle line:84%
have been asking where
did all the rubble go?

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.796 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been
asking folks that,

00:09:01.796 --> 00:09:03.659 align:middle line:84%
and one volunteer,
Robert Ralinsky,

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
explained it all fell
down into the ground,

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:90%
was pulverized, and evaporated.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And you
think, this poor guy--

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That doesn't happen.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --that's the best he
can do to explain what happened.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At that moment.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But he was explaining
to the best of his ability.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: He's not a scientist.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:25.484 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of folks, you
know, they understand reality

00:09:25.484 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:10%
to be this way, and they
try to fit everything

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:10%
into those cubbyholes.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:10%
Like the rumors of
hot, steel-toed boots,

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.060 align:middle line:10%
boots melting.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:10%
No reports of burned feet.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, if my oven
is melting, steel oven,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.497 align:middle line:84%
the turkey inside is
more than well done.

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:10%
But there's no reports
of burned feet,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:10%
but something was
happening to the shoes.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.604 align:middle line:84%
They're at least documenting
that something weird

00:09:48.604 --> 00:09:49.770 align:middle line:90%
was going on with the shoes.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.867 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:50.867 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
hear this, do they?

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't want anything
that upsets the apple cart.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.125 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they afraid of?

00:09:57.125 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Um, not
going with the flow.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:10%
Even like the climate
change issues--

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:10%
there's some folks who've
spoken out about that.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They can't get a job
elsewhere, either.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no question
that within government, there

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:84%
are people who are not
acting for our behalf.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:17.965 align:middle line:90%
They've got their own agenda.

00:10:17.965 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Mm-hmm.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not to say
government does this, or--

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Exactly.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --the President--

00:10:22.605 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Exactly.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.693 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --did this.

00:10:23.693 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't think when this tragedy
occurred George Bush knew

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.180 align:middle line:90%
what was happening at all.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Correct.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
look at his face--

00:10:30.765 --> 00:10:31.565 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I agree.

00:10:31.565 --> 00:10:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --when he was talking
to those kids in that school.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:90%
He was in shock.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: He was clueless.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: He didn't
know what to do.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.521 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was in shock.

00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But there are facets
within government

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that I would say are
rogue, doing what

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.030 align:middle line:90%
they do for their own purposes.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Mm-hmm.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back
to the JFK assassination.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
in my mind that there

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:84%
were people within government
who knew what was happening.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And they just either
sat by and did nothing,

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:90%
or they were part of it.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And with 9/11, I'm now convinced
there was a bigger story here.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I will say until
the day I die, Judy,

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.290 align:middle line:90%
that government didn't do it.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
The United States did not
take down those buildings.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I agree.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there was a
group of rogue conspiracists

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:90%
who were involved in something.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.391 align:middle line:84%
And now look at what's happening
around this planet today.

00:11:28.391 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The people are
afraid to stand up to it.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Because they
think they'll be history.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:90%
This is the likelihood.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
But somebody's got to
do it at some point.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.457 align:middle line:84%
And if-- more people that
stand up, the better.

00:11:40.457 --> 00:11:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And the so-called terrorists
that were involved--

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any doubts
that those kinds of people

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
were recruited to
do what they did

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:90%
for the image of what happened.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We don't even know what
those people supposedly did,

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.295 align:middle line:84%
or where they came
from, went to, or--

00:11:58.295 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have anything
to do with the buildings,

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.770 align:middle line:90%
as far as we know.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And wasn't
it true that some

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called terrorists
and hijackers were alive,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't who
they said they were?

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And they said, wait a
minute, that's not me!

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm here!

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: As far as I
know, on that day,

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I remember hearing
that story about they

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:84%
already had this
list before noon.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And if they know these
people are on the plane,

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:90%
why'd they let it go?

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, just sit back
and twiddle their thumbs.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During
JFK's assassination,

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I recall that a
newspaper in Europe

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
already had Oswald
as the assassin

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.304 align:middle line:90%
before we knew about it.

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But people
will believe whatever

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:90%
you want them to believe.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:90%
That's how it ends up working.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why I keep coming back
to evidence, because that's not

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:90%
anything to do with belief.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in tragedy, people
will always say to government,

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.741 align:middle line:90%
please save us.

00:12:57.741 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do what you can for us.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's where
governments take control.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got the
Homeland Security Act.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And we seem to be able to go
into countries willy-nilly

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:84%
without any congressional
approval at all.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:10%
We just go.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And it-- I mean, you
know, I can't believe,

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Judy, you know--
here we are, 2018.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:90%
We're still in Iraq.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.972 align:middle line:90%
We're still in Afghanistan.

00:13:21.972 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's
important to recognize

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that what happened
on 9/11 was an attack

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:90%
on human consciousness.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
more about that.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Look at how
it affected people.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.850 align:middle line:10%
They were unable to think
clearly, unable to function.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:10%
And they were just like they
were in a daze or hypnotized.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think we still are.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We--

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.783 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: For the most part.

00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We still are hypnotized
in a situation where we just

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:90%
can't seem to get out of it.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.642 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: For example,
how many court cases

00:13:53.642 --> 00:13:56.860 align:middle line:10%
do you know where they
look at intersection videos

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:10%
to see where somebody
went through at what time?

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.700 align:middle line:10%
And they can monitor
people wherever they are.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: We wouldn't
have allowed that--

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: No.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:04.890 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: --before 9/11.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You know.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:10%
Now we welcome it.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
please, save us!

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Help us!

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:84%
You've brought some
incredible images

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
which backs up what you've been
talking about all these years.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And let's go through
some of them, Judy.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And tell us what
we're looking at.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: OK.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:10%
Well, in this first one, which
is also on the cover of my book

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:10%
'cause it's so important--

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:10%
just from this picture.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.231 align:middle line:10%
And by the time you get to the
end, you can look back at this

00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:31.239 align:middle line:10%
and say, wow!

00:14:31.239 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What are
we looking at here?

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Those buildings
didn't burn up,

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:10%
nor did they slam to the
ground, but mostly turned

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:10%
to dust in midair.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.640 align:middle line:10%
This is the North
Tower, Tower 1.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:10%
And would you
believe, right now,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:10%
when that picture
was taken, there's

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:10%
14 people in stairway B,
second, third, and fourth floor,

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:10%
who when the dust settled,
walked out on their own.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.652 align:middle line:84%
They looked up and saw
blue sky and walked out.

00:14:56.652 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
They didn't-- they
weren't crushed.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
would have crashed.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.240 align:middle line:84%
They should have been
mangled, for crying out loud.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.365 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: And one of them
said it felt like he walked

00:15:03.365 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:10%
onto an empty football field.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez!

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The buildings literally
turned to dust in midair.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:10%
If a piece of steel is
flying through the air,

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.189 align:middle line:10%
it dissolves before
it hits ground.

00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Those little red
arrows-- what do they depict?

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Showing how it's,
like, squirting up and out.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's important that you
first determine what happened.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
You got to know what
problem you're solving.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.035 align:middle line:10%
I often ask people, is
27 the right answer?

00:15:30.035 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:90%
The right answer to what?

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: And if you don't
know what it was that

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:10%
happened, how can you
tell how it happened,

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:10%
if you don't know what it is.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we still
don't know who did it.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Really, do we?

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But I'm almost
positive I know who knows.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:50.020 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones
I took to court.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.936 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, again,
the judges, I think,

00:15:51.936 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:84%
were afraid to let
the case go forward.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody
wanted to touch it.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Nobody
wanted to touch it.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: So how it happened
is vital to figuring it out.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:10%
So that's what I
mainly focus on.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And that usually
speaks for itself.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.510 align:middle line:84%
The evidence tells
you what happened.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's get oriented.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the World
Trade Center complex.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:90%
And we have the two towers.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.810 align:middle line:84%
There's the North Tower, and
then we have the South Tower.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And the North Tower you
can tell because it's

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
further north, but also
it's got that TV antenna

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:84%
on top of it that
makes it more obvious.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: At the base of it is
Building 3 in the foreground.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.060 align:middle line:90%
You have 4, 5, and 6 behind it.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Building 7 is across the street.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It went down, too.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And just looking
at this picture,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.386 align:middle line:90%
Judy, just brings back--

00:16:46.386 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's amazing
how much material.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.080 align:middle line:84%
That's a quarter mile--
over a quarter mile tall.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.226 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:51.226 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: So now
let's say you work

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:84%
in Bankers Trust over
there across the street.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.296 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go in there and
go up to about the 21st floor,

00:16:58.296 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and then, you know, look out
your window from your office

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:90%
and see what it looks like.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.549 align:middle line:84%
What do you think it's
going to look like?

00:17:03.549 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Whoops.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.909 align:middle line:90%
Where did the building go?

00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did it go?

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Poof!

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Notice we're looking
through a window glass that's

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:90%
intact, right across the street.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is that the
base of one of the towers?

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Correct.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:28.369 align:middle line:84%
That's the base of Tower 2 or
the outer columns of the lobby.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:90%
But nothing's taller than that.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And everything's
just pulverized.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: At ground level.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go
look the other direction.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.040 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: That's over by
where Building 4 was.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Whoops.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Where did that building go?

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:54.990 align:middle line:84%
The main body of Building 4 went
missing like it was cut off.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.294 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.294 --> 00:17:59.817 align:middle line:10%
You know, the tipping
top of Tower 2

00:17:59.817 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:10%
is going to-- looked like it was
going to fall on top of that,

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:10%
but it just turned
to dust in midair.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And didn't
people hear explosions?

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.511 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: If you're
disintegrating something,

00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:11.010 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
hear things go boom.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.230 align:middle line:10%
But, you know, bombs go
boom, and not everything

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:10%
that goes boom is a bomb.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:10%
Think of an egg in
your microwave oven.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So again, you know, this is
the orientation of the site.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If you were to add
the laws of probability, Judy,

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.460 align:middle line:10%
on the buildings collapsing
the way they all did,

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.350 align:middle line:10%
how astronomical would that be?

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Oh, there's
no probability

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:10%
for it 'cause it doesn't happen.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:10%
What I ended up
seeing from this is

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:10%
that instead of atoms being
attracted to each other,

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:10%
they decide to repel each other.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.880 align:middle line:84%
They were instructed
somehow to repel each other.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't pulverization.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:10%
Pulverization is a grinding.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, vaporization
takes high heat.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.500 align:middle line:84%
This was something else,
so it needed a new name.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:90%
I call it dustification.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Just-- the building was
turned into fine particles.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at a video which

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:84%
helps illustrate some
of these things that

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.579 align:middle line:90%
have been happening.

00:19:06.579 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
looking at here, Judy?

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We're looking at the
North Tower turning to dust.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, my gosh!

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's a little
bit dark, but you'll

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
see on the front corner a
beam-- a solid beam fall down,

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:84%
or start to come down,
but then it doesn't ever

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:84%
make it to the ground
because it turns

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:90%
to dust before it gets there.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it unusual,
the pattern of the dust?

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.685 align:middle line:90%
Does that tell you anything?

00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it's
just that it--

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looks
like it's going up.

00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And some of it does.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
It goes up into the upper
atmosphere, or the upper part

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:90%
of the atmosphere.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.170 align:middle line:90%
See the beam right down--

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: --at the bottom?

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:90%
It just turns to dust.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell me
the dust overtook it,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:90%
a solid piece of steel.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:84%
It turns to dust and
never hits the ground.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
technology, in your opinion,

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:90%
would do something like that?

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Something that we don't
normally see in regular life.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But we have seen
it occur naturally.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.945 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean "occurs naturally?"

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.131 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Ah!

00:20:26.131 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:90%
That part of Building 4?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:10%
It reminded me of
something I saw as a child

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:10%
when we drove through
Topeka, Kansas,

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:10%
right after that big,
horrendous tornado.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I saw apartment
buildings-- well,

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.360 align:middle line:84%
they were probably
dorms, but I thought

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:84%
they were apartment
buildings-- sliced in two.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Half of it
there, half of it gone.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
just-- they implode.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Or there
was-- the bedspread

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:84%
was in perfect
condition, bed made,

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.940 align:middle line:84%
some magazines on the beds
and books on the dresser.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Things hanging in the closet
that were not touched.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Wind does not do that.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that disintegrated

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:90%
half the building.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at our
next picture here, Judy,

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:90%
and have you explain it.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.895 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: We're going to
look right there, down

00:21:04.895 --> 00:21:08.160 align:middle line:10%
on the ground, in
front of Building 1.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:90%
It's right at ground level.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:84%
There's the north and south
walls of the North Tower,

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:90%
right at ground level.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's an ambulance there
that looks pretty much intact.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Now it doesn't look
clobbered by beams.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, there's
a 110-story building

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:90%
that just went away.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's just gone.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:84%
You would think half of
it would still be there.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Or something.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, there'd
be a pile of stuff.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking
about this pancaking,

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:90%
you'd have a pile of pancakes.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.605 align:middle line:90%
But you don't see that.

00:21:42.605 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
about the controversy

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:90%
of taking the material away?

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't that strange too?

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It was gone
before noon on 9/11.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It was gone
before the dust cleared.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
'Cause once the dust
cleared, you know,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:84%
folks said they saw an
empty football field.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, it
was a crime scene.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:84%
A crime scene
should stay intact.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It wasn't
necessarily removed.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:04.904 align:middle line:90%
It just wasn't there.

00:22:04.904 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:84%
That was the explanation for
why you don't see much debris.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, this is this
dome of this 44 story building.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.849 align:middle line:84%
It's right across the
street from Tower 1.

00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not even touched!

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.629 align:middle line:90%
It's not clobbered.

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's nothing on it.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Building 7 went
away that afternoon

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and, over by the
post office, you

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.257 align:middle line:84%
can see it didn't even spill
completely across the street.

00:22:29.257 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Didn't fully cover the sidewalk.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could
that be so pristine?

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Like, where
did the stuff go?

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, are you
still baffled at this point?

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Even though you've come up
with your own conclusions?

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, you can see that
the building did not collapse.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:90%
It didn't fall down, go boom.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:48.590 align:middle line:90%
It turned to dust in midair.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:84%
They originally
built the towers out,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and they made extra land
because it's so valuable.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And they built this retaining
wall around the towers.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:84%
They were built seven stories
below the water table.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.330 align:middle line:84%
But would you believe that
that wall was not destroyed?

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all?

00:23:06.255 --> 00:23:07.055 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Nope.

00:23:07.055 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's
in pristine condition,

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't spring a leak.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's a tunnel that
goes underneath there

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.150 align:middle line:84%
with subway trains that go
over to the New Jersey side.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:84%
The tunnels were built,
like, the early-1900s.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:90%
They're still there.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Here's after they
cleaned out the bathtub--

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:90%
that's what they call it--

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:84%
the original wall
is still there.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it is.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying that
the equipment used

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:90%
to implode and pulverize--

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.697 align:middle line:84%
was it directed as like a
particle beam from someplace?

00:23:44.697 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It was instructed.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Directed, as in giving
it directions what to do.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Instructed at what to
do and where to do it.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Just like your TV
remote control--

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:84%
it instructs the TV or directs
the TV to change the channel.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the theories we

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:07.620 align:middle line:84%
heard about dynamite being put
in the buildings weeks before

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that?

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This graphic here
kind of answers that.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:84%
See, WTC 2 just went away
at the top, and then WTC 1.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you have these
various quarry blasts all day.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:10%
And then, see-- down
here at the bottom,

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:10%
you have that little
black thing on the--

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:32.270 align:middle line:10%
What are those things?

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.728 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: That was an earthquake
in the Fox Islands, which is

00:24:34.728 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:10%
a part of the Aleutian Islands.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right there.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:84%
But look at this thing
just before then.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.782 align:middle line:90%
That was Building 7 going away.

00:24:43.782 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:84%
You can't even see
it on the chart.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: It made a 0.60
equivalency on the Richter

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.520 align:middle line:10%
scale, which is
like a jackhammer.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:57.364 align:middle line:10%
And it was six times the
mass of the Kingdome.

00:24:57.364 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So what
you're saying is,

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:10%
is it should have
spiked even higher.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.890 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What else do we have?

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.430 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Not only that.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.554 align:middle line:90%
That made no S- or P-wave.

00:25:09.554 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
That's primary or
secondary waves.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.470 align:middle line:84%
No wave traveled
through the earth.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.170 align:middle line:90%
It was only surface waves.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't happen in
building demolitions.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, you always
have an S-wave and P-wave

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:90%
with building demolitions.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
But let's consider three
different kinds of energy.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Thermal energy would
cause vaporization.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.850 align:middle line:90%
It's from high heat.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:90%
We can rule out high heat.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Kinetic energy, like
gravity collapse.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.629 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Bangity-bang
or, you know, bombs.

00:25:38.629 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Something that flies
through the air,

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:90%
you know, and hits something.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.530 align:middle line:84%
But then something
else was going on.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So the energy was told to
do something differently

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:90%
than it normally does.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Directed.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That's what I'm
calling directed energy.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
It's-- just leaving it in
the most general terms.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
direct energy like that?

00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Directed energy?

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.554 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it's just--
if something is directed,

00:26:02.554 --> 00:26:04.120 align:middle line:90%
putting it in a field.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.015 align:middle line:84%
Having it subjected
to field effects.

00:26:07.015 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, would you
have to have a huge apparatus

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.550 align:middle line:84%
or something to
bombard something?

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Not necessarily.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's not think about
a gizmo so much yet.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:10%
It's just looking
at the evidence.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:10%
Like in this image
here, you can see

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.527 align:middle line:10%
steel beams coming down, hurling
enormous amounts of dust.

00:26:25.527 --> 00:26:27.610 align:middle line:10%
And they're falling down
towards an intersection--

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You could see them.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:10%
You could see little
specks of them, right?

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:30.340 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Those are the beams?

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:31.810 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:10%
You see, you know, a
horizontal solid beam.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.156 align:middle line:84%
Now, think if you're going to
try to impersonate that beam.

00:26:36.156 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, you cover
yourself with dust,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and you jump off the
top of the building.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.590 align:middle line:84%
On the way down, can
the guy on the ground

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.660 align:middle line:90%
see much dust coming off you?

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, you carry
some bags of flour,

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and you toss those
out on the way down.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:53.240 align:middle line:84%
You can't come anywhere
close to this amount of dust.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's look at another
piece of video if we can, Judy,

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.290 align:middle line:10%
and have you explain to
us what we're looking at.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's happening here?

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This is a part of
the remaining core columns.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing it's probably
Stairway B, actually.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:16.422 align:middle line:84%
And you see it's got
nice, clear air around it.

00:27:16.422 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:84%
See, there's like a banana
peel pulling away from it.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Stuff is being
torn away from it.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's obviously
strong 'cause

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.010 align:middle line:90%
it's still standing there.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's very rigid and strong
to withstand those walls being

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:90%
pulled away from it.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think this
entire area, this region,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.290 align:middle line:90%
was bombarded at the same time?

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Something
was going on there.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:90%
We can see that much.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:10%
Like, think of an
Alka-Seltzer tablet.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.560 align:middle line:84%
In dry atmosphere, it's
just this rigid object.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.990 align:middle line:10%
You change its environment,
put it in a wet--

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:10%
you know, water.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.690 align:middle line:10%
It effervesces and dissolves.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.600 align:middle line:10%
So if you could do something
like that with a building,

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.840 align:middle line:10%
change its environment somehow
that would affect the material

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.970 align:middle line:10%
to have it effervesce
and to dissolve.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We keep hearing
stories about thermite being

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:90%
discovered in the buildings.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.640 align:middle line:84%
What is thermite, and what's
the significance of that?

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's a distraction
because thermite

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:19.790 align:middle line:84%
is a mixture of aluminum
powder and iron oxide.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.590 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you have
a steel structure

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.920 align:middle line:10%
with aluminum cladding, and you
turn it to dust, what are you

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.870 align:middle line:10%
going to have?

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way of distracting
people and to, you know,

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.280 align:middle line:90%
don't look here.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Look over at this little
speck over here and, you know,

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.180 align:middle line:90%
look away from the evidence.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.596 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
magician's hand, huh?

00:28:36.596 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And it's sort of a test
to see how gullible people are

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.795 align:middle line:90%
'cause thermite--

00:28:43.795 --> 00:28:46.400 align:middle line:90%
it burns very hot, very bright.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And I like to refer to that
Manfred Mann Earth Band song,

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.780 align:middle line:90%
"Blinded by the Light."

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, that was
missing on 9/11.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was blinded by
any horrendous light.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, they
didn't burn up.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why hasn't
there been really more

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:90%
of an investigation?

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Into your work, for example?

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't some groups
saying, we need to study this.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:19.880 align:middle line:84%
She has conclusions that are
horrible if they're true.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's investigate
this, and bring

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.190 align:middle line:84%
in scientists, and architects,
and people like that.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they do that?

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Uh, don't
like the answer?

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:84%
There's no other conclusion
you can come to when

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:90%
looking through the evidence.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.622 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people give this
book to someone who is a,

00:29:39.622 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:84%
you know-- oh, no, it happened
just like they told us

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.510 align:middle line:90%
on TV that day.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.632 align:middle line:84%
Well, can you find the
error in this book?

00:29:45.632 --> 00:29:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And the person who combs through
it backwards and forwards,

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:84%
inside and out, and pretty soon
they realize-- uh-oh, you know.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.494 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:29:53.494 --> 00:29:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has this
done to you personally,

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:56.880 align:middle line:90%
Judy, since you've done this?

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And are you glad you
started doing this?

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Or would you have preferred
you didn't even touch it?

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.710 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: I'm glad I
did it because we only

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.740 align:middle line:10%
go through this life once.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
moment I decided

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:84%
to do that, I sort of said
something to my students.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, if you knew the world
was going to end in a week,

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:84%
and there was very little
chance you could save it,

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.502 align:middle line:90%
would you try?

00:30:20.502 --> 00:30:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I still would.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Because you
don't want to have

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.319 align:middle line:90%
that on your conscience.

00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:27.010 align:middle line:84%
You want to do as
much as you can do.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:90%
That's where I was.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it affect
your employment?

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, yeah.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And actually, when I first
started talking about this,

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I had various detractors
writing to the dean,

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.484 align:middle line:90%
writing to my department chair.

00:30:40.484 --> 00:30:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they hated you.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, just lots of trash.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a talk scheduled on
campus and that got canceled.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
what gets in the way.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what I don't get
about discussion and opinion.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.850 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
to agree with you.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
accept your conclusions.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have to attack
you and try to destroy you.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:08.010 align:middle line:10%
Because as far as
I'm concerned, isn't

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:11.934 align:middle line:10%
it the American way to
question, to probe, to come up--

00:31:11.934 --> 00:31:12.850 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: The scientist.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --with this?

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.130 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that you
may go against the grain

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.570 align:middle line:84%
isn't a reason to ruin
you or destroy you.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Simply say, well, that's
Dr. Wood's opinion.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.320 align:middle line:90%
She's entitled to it.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.690 align:middle line:90%
This is my opinion.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm entitled to it.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:90%
And move on.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Instead, there's
a concerted effort

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.454 align:middle line:90%
to shut you down, to quiet you.

00:31:37.454 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: And they
don't want people

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.460 align:middle line:10%
to see various
pieces of evidence

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.250 align:middle line:10%
like this particular one
here where the building just

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:10%
froths up into dust.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What are
they afraid of, Judy?

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Oh, it might
scare somebody.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:50.966 align:middle line:90%
I'm just guessing.

00:31:50.966 --> 00:31:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.381 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at some
more objects here.

00:31:53.381 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:10%
Now what are we looking
at right here, Judy?

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.870 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: This is like
that video we just saw.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.760 align:middle line:10%
There's some still
shots from it.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.840 align:middle line:10%
And you can see that the
remaining core columns,

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:10%
in that first upper-left
image, to the right,

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.700 align:middle line:10%
you see it's now getting weak.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.200 align:middle line:10%
We knew they were
strong 'cause they

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:10%
had the various pieces to
the sides of them torn away,

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:30.830 align:middle line:10%
but now it's getting soft
and starting to wilt.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.080 align:middle line:10%
And the bottom shows
a sequence of images

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.840 align:middle line:10%
where you see around
them this very crisp air,

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.480 align:middle line:10%
and then pretty soon
it's not crisp anymore.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:10%
The thing just turns to
dust right before your eyes.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.810 align:middle line:90%


00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:10%
Detractors like to say the
dust was settled, not shook up,

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.540 align:middle line:10%
but that doesn't
jibe how that works.

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:10%
OK, we have from the
different directions.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Then in this image,
we have some steel--

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.040 align:middle line:90%
I call it Wheat Chex--

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.960 align:middle line:90%
the prefab sections--

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's just imploding.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.268 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: --falling down.

00:33:05.268 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
You can see that
they're losing material

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.486 align:middle line:90%
as it gets lower to the ground.

00:33:11.486 --> 00:33:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And this-- you said, what
happened to Building 7?

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 7, which has been
always a puzzle then for me.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This looks like
it's the top of Tower 2.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.650 align:middle line:90%
See how the top tips over?

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And then
it turns to dust.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.820 align:middle line:90%
It's 35 stories.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.120 align:middle line:84%
It's almost the
size of Building 7.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:33.715 align:middle line:84%
Think of this Building 7 just
sitting on top of lower port.

00:33:33.715 --> 00:33:36.150 align:middle line:84%
See how it just shrinks up
before the rest of the building

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:36.950 align:middle line:90%
goes away?

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.442 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.442 --> 00:33:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there's really--

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:90%
nothing hit it.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right!

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:90%
It just shrinks up.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.689 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:46.689 --> 00:33:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And those--
was the dust hot?

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, these guys
obviously endured it.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And I like how it shows
where this guy's tie was--

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.520 align:middle line:84%
that the dust came
all of a sudden.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:90%
They survived it.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.557 align:middle line:84%
It might be hard to breathe,
but they didn't get cooked.

00:34:02.557 --> 00:34:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't get cooked.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.474 align:middle line:84%
They may have had
lung problems later.

00:34:05.474 --> 00:34:06.273 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Mm-hmm.

00:34:06.273 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Another very
weird thing was the--

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.760 align:middle line:90%
I call them toasted cars.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily
indicating cause.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:13.610 align:middle line:90%
They're toast.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.450 align:middle line:90%
They're history.

00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:17.239 align:middle line:90%
They get done in.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:84%
This police car--
the lights on the top

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:25.379 align:middle line:84%
are kind of a plastic that
would easily melt if it was hot.

00:34:25.379 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: If you had some
rip-roaring fire going on

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.312 align:middle line:84%
inside, it'd be like
a brew up there.

00:34:30.312 --> 00:34:31.520 align:middle line:10%
But those lights didn't melt.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.353 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
look like it was melted.

00:34:33.353 --> 00:34:35.696 align:middle line:84%
It looks like just
things crushed them.

00:34:35.696 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, it's
polycarbonate.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it's interesting how
it abruptly stops at the door.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Gas tanks didn't explode.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the other
side of that car.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.076 align:middle line:90%
There's a spot that is pristine.

00:34:48.076 --> 00:34:48.909 align:middle line:10%
It's like it has a--

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:50.284 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And it's
really not that

00:34:50.284 --> 00:34:53.620 align:middle line:10%
scorched for the
kind of fires that

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.698 align:middle line:10%
were in there and the heat.

00:34:55.698 --> 00:34:56.739 align:middle line:10%
I mean, look at the back.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:58.077 align:middle line:10%
It's still white.

00:34:58.077 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Like the showroom floor.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.757 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:00.757 --> 00:35:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: There's some
upside-down cars.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Like, how'd they
get upside down?

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How'd that happen?

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They're just fine
except they're upside-down.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What flipped them?

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.590 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Ah, turns out there's
evidence of levitation.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:17.350 align:middle line:84%
There's detractors that like
to say that the cars got towed.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
how some of them were,

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.940 align:middle line:90%
but I know these were not towed.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.356 align:middle line:84%
You can see them
before and after.

00:35:22.356 --> 00:35:25.112 align:middle line:90%


00:35:25.112 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those are
cars in a parking lot?

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.210 align:middle line:84%
It's diagonally across
from the towers,

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.157 align:middle line:84%
in the Embassy
Suites parking lot.

00:35:33.157 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can see cars
adjacent to each other.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:36.698 align:middle line:84%
One might be OK, and
the other one isn't.

00:35:36.698 --> 00:35:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The other one's fine.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: There's a sea
of unburned paper.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could literally
get in some of them

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.600 align:middle line:90%
and drive them away.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.671 align:middle line:90%
And some people did.

00:35:43.671 --> 00:35:44.471 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:35:44.471 --> 00:35:47.820 align:middle line:90%


00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Now this is a
really bizarre artifact.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is it?

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's a Bible artifact
that's in the 9/11 museum.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
The Pope even came to
visit and visit this item.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:06.240 align:middle line:10%
And folks often like to point
out that formerly molten metal

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:12.209 align:middle line:10%
that was on the page, it wasn't
molten because it was hot.

00:36:12.209 --> 00:36:13.500 align:middle line:10%
The pages would have burned up.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: It was liquid metal
because of another reason.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe it was Divine
Providence that saved it.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: [LAUGHS] There's
other things that

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.700 align:middle line:90%
show it wasn't high heat.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Like this map in the
upper-left, folks often

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:34.074 align:middle line:84%
cite that saying that, oh,
look all that high heat.

00:36:34.074 --> 00:36:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It is-- something was
being interpreted,

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't correctly
interpreted as heat,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.360 align:middle line:84%
because it claimed it was 800
or 915 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.120 align:middle line:90%
But the water isn't boiling.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.192 align:middle line:90%
And here those guys are wading.

00:36:48.192 --> 00:36:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they did
what they wanted to do.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:84%
They accomplished
the spectacular.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.790 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Yep.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:54.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: People saw this.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:54.380 align:middle line:10%
It was--

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.255 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Shock and awe.

00:36:55.255 --> 00:36:56.055 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --tragic.

00:36:56.055 --> 00:36:58.460 align:middle line:84%
We immediately went
into Afghanistan

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.270 align:middle line:84%
to chase down the
Taliban, and to get

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Osama bin Laden and his
group of al-Qaeda members.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.500 align:middle line:90%
And then we kept going.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.300 align:middle line:90%
We kept going.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.830 align:middle line:84%
We created the issue of weapons
of mass destruction in Iraq.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And do you think all of this
was the focal point for what

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.220 align:middle line:84%
happened subsequently,
and where we are today?

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:84%
That this was the
impetus to allow

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:90%
us to do what we are doing now?

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Not necessarily.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:30.750 align:middle line:10%
Yes, but clearly it changed
the mindset of the world.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.620 align:middle line:10%
And there's a lot of people
that just kind of shut down

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.950 align:middle line:10%
their thinking after that.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sort of left the
world sitting back going,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.270 align:middle line:84%
we understand what the
United States needs

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.580 align:middle line:90%
to do now to defend itself.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.370 align:middle line:90%
Let them go in.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Because without
9/11, we couldn't

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:57.920 align:middle line:84%
have just gone into Afghanistan,
or Iraq, or anything like that.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.510 align:middle line:84%
The Russians would
have protested.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Something would have happened.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:06.235 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
tragedy, nobody stopped us.

00:38:06.235 --> 00:38:08.110 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: I don't get into
those kind of things

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.318 align:middle line:10%
so much because that's sort
of like mind reading what

00:38:10.318 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:10%
intentions are.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.960 align:middle line:84%
But you can see from
evidence of that, you know,

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:84%
it isn't the story
we were given.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.190 align:middle line:10%
Like, for example,
this image here.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:22.130 align:middle line:10%
We were talking about buildings
didn't necessarily go down.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Some might have gone down,
but a lot of it went up.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And this shows it
going up, and up, and up.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:90%
There's some strange reaction--

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:36.400 align:middle line:84%
perhaps helium production,
which you see in cold fusion,

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.960 align:middle line:90%
caused it to go up.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.760 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
whatever happened

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:43.810 align:middle line:84%
to the buildings,
Judy, was already

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:47.347 align:middle line:84%
implanted in the buildings,
or this is from the outside?

00:38:47.347 --> 00:38:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Didn't need to be.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.039 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And so I wanted
to see where that--

00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:54.080 align:middle line:90%
how far up the dust went.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.121 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked at some
weather satellite maps,

00:38:56.121 --> 00:38:57.610 align:middle line:90%
and I saw this.

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.750 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Hurricane Erin.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a Category 3 hurricane.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It was heading towards New
York City for four days

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:06.000 align:middle line:90%
prior to 9/11.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh!

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.050 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: It had been around
for a lot longer than that,

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.330 align:middle line:10%
but it made a beeline to
New York City for four days

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:12.130 align:middle line:10%
straight.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.090 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Isn't that ironic?

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:18.390 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: What is really weird
is that we didn't really

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:19.190 align:middle line:10%
hear much about it.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: No.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.400 align:middle line:10%
Not at all.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: For four days, it was
heading straight to Manhattan.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.619 align:middle line:10%
How can they be 100% sure
when and where that thing's

00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:30.535 align:middle line:10%
going to turn around--

00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:31.335 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:33.590 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: --to that they
don't tell anybody

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.320 align:middle line:10%
and don't evacuate Manhattan?

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.230 align:middle line:10%
It was actually raining
on the end of Long Island.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's like the
perfect storm, isn't it?

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:42.919 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:39:42.919 --> 00:39:44.960 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: A flight attendant
who flew out of Boston

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.010 align:middle line:10%
that morning contacted me
after he saw this on my website

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:10%
and said, we never
were told about that.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Flight attendants weren't
even told about it.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
The plane took off
and then veered west.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, in spite of the
protests of some people who

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:04.020 align:middle line:84%
have demanded your ouster
and everything else

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:08.360 align:middle line:84%
from what you've done, you've
had a lot of support, too.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.687 align:middle line:90%
And that's growing?

00:40:09.687 --> 00:40:11.060 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Mm-hmm.

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.870 align:middle line:10%
Different people have reached
out to say various things.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.402 align:middle line:10%
They're kind of afraid of
getting beat up themselves.

00:40:17.402 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
I remember getting

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.170 align:middle line:84%
a call during my open
lines on "Coast to Coast"

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:23.630 align:middle line:84%
a year or two ago
and, of course,

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:25.820 align:middle line:84%
you've been on the
program several times.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.700 align:middle line:10%
But this caller
was vehement that I

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.090 align:middle line:10%
wasn't giving enough time to
you, that you should be on.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.340 align:middle line:90%
I said, wait a minute, she's--

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing
programs with her.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Don't you listen?

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I listen all the time,
you haven't had her on!

00:40:37.610 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:10%
I said, yes, I have!

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But you've got some
staunch supporters

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:47.690 align:middle line:84%
out there who just won't accept
the official version of what

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:48.980 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:51.480 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Well, one of the
tricks also that's done,

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.550 align:middle line:10%
if you want to keep
something covered up--

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.130 align:middle line:10%
if you don't like the lie
behind door number one,

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.200 align:middle line:10%
they show you the lie
behind door number two.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or three.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:40:59.950 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Or three.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:00.750 align:middle line:10%
Or four!

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.916 align:middle line:10%
Anything to keep you from
turning around and looking

00:41:02.916 --> 00:41:05.760 align:middle line:10%
at the wide open field
of evidence behind you.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at a
couple of more images here.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This is from
weather forecasts shown

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:16.680 align:middle line:84%
10 to 15 minutes before
the North Tower got

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.270 align:middle line:90%
its airplane-shaped hole.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And the CBS
one at the bottom-right

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.600 align:middle line:84%
says as nice as can be, they're
predicting, in New York.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:90%
No mention of this hurricane.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is barreling
down on New York at the time!

00:41:32.595 --> 00:41:33.395 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:41:33.395 --> 00:41:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And the guy on the top
image, where he has--

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.090 align:middle line:84%
the top-left image
with his hands apart--

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:41.070 align:middle line:84%
his hands would be
covered by the hurricane.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And by the way,
where did the hurricane

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.350 align:middle line:90%
go afterwards?

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.382 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It turned around, headed
out of town that afternoon.

00:41:46.382 --> 00:41:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And then headed up-- it stayed
a hurricane for the next day

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.490 align:middle line:84%
or so, headed up the
eastern seaboard.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:54.780 align:middle line:84%
It made, you know,
almost a 180 degree turn.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like a 110
degree turn, actually.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Judy, there
was an experiment

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:01.290 align:middle line:84%
that demonstrates what is
known as the Hutchinson Effect

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.798 align:middle line:90%
from John Hutchinson.

00:42:02.798 --> 00:42:05.792 align:middle line:90%


00:42:05.792 --> 00:42:07.788 align:middle line:90%
[BUZZING]

00:42:07.788 --> 00:42:14.280 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
looking at here, Judy?

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This is an
iron bar, and he's

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:90%
got his field effects on it.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:28.215 align:middle line:84%
His interferes radio
frequency signals,

00:42:28.215 --> 00:42:30.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's within a static field.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:31.680 align:middle line:90%
And it does this.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's his machine
in the background that we hear.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Did you see the puff
of haze coming off the end?

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.427 align:middle line:90%
It looks like smoke, but--

00:42:40.427 --> 00:42:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at it.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.200 align:middle line:90%
It just kind of shriveled away.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And it was
cold to the touch.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cold to the touch.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And there's actually
some images like that on 9/11.

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think that
kind of technology might have

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.645 align:middle line:90%
contributed to--

00:42:55.645 --> 00:42:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, that type of thing.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the destruction
to those towers?

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.490 align:middle line:10%
He was demonstrating
something he had discovered,

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:02.050 align:middle line:10%
but it happens naturally.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.300 align:middle line:10%
What is a tornado?

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.930 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: You see vehicles
flying through the air.

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:10.330 align:middle line:10%
Wind doesn't do that.

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:14.610 align:middle line:84%
How would wind get underneath
a truck and lift it vertically?

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:16.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, like 200
feet off the ground?

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And then it doesn't crash down,
it's-- it gets set back down.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:23.347 align:middle line:84%
You hear about people
getting lifted by tornadoes

00:43:23.347 --> 00:43:24.430 align:middle line:90%
and getting set back down.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Oh, of course, there's
the "Wizard of Oz."

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:31.890 align:middle line:10%
But it is a known thing,
and like that tornado

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:36.600 align:middle line:10%
that I saw the effects of when I
was a child, with the apartment

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.064 align:middle line:10%
building sliced in two,
it does that very thing.

00:43:39.064 --> 00:43:40.230 align:middle line:90%
It goes in a straight line--

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.970 align:middle line:90%
cut a building in two.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if somebody
decides to weaponize that?

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, exactly.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And that may be the end game
that I've been talking about.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if you had
that kind of a weapon,

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.531 align:middle line:90%
God knows what you could do.

00:43:56.531 --> 00:43:58.780 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: There's various
things I didn't put in my book

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.700 align:middle line:10%
because it was too
much blood and guts.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.230 align:middle line:90%
It was just too horrible.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But there was physical things
that happened to people.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, already, as
we know, that there

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:10.360 align:middle line:84%
is at least 1,000 people who
went missing that they never

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.250 align:middle line:90%
found any trace of DNA for.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.766 align:middle line:90%
They were dustified.

00:44:13.766 --> 00:44:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Just gone.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Beyond-- yeah,
just beyond that size.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.610 align:middle line:10%
You realize those dust
particles were smaller

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.000 align:middle line:10%
than anything that has
been seen with, like, fires

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.980 align:middle line:10%
or with pulverization?

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.460 align:middle line:84%
It was about 1/100 the
size of red blood cells.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, when you
read the Bible about the episode

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:37.914 align:middle line:84%
of Sodom and Gomorrah,
and how it was destroyed--

00:44:37.914 --> 00:44:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: The walls of--

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and it seems
strangely the same way.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Mm-hmm.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I think back then people weren't
afraid to try weird things.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But now people are afraid to
just step outside the box.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think that
those responsible for this

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:03.910 align:middle line:84%
were in shock at the results,
after we saw the devastation?

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:06.730 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: I'm guessing
they probably don't know.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:10.190 align:middle line:10%
It is-- you keep something
so compartmentalized--

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:10%
somebody does one thing,
a training exercise.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Fly from point A to point
B. Somebody's supposed

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to walk from point B to point
C. They don't know what they're

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.680 align:middle line:90%
doing as for the whole picture.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 'Cause they had to
have the planes for the illusion

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.087 align:middle line:90%
of the buildings collapsing.

00:45:26.087 --> 00:45:26.886 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:45:26.886 --> 00:45:28.387 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
without the planes,

00:45:28.387 --> 00:45:30.845 align:middle line:84%
the buildings aren't just going
to pulverize and disappear.

00:45:30.845 --> 00:45:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then that opens up the
door for all kinds of things.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.670 align:middle line:90%
So they created that illusion.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:40.520 align:middle line:84%
They continue to
create illusions.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.720 align:middle line:90%
What's the next step?

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Because now they've got 17
years since this happened.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:48.680 align:middle line:84%
This technology might even
be even more damaging.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.140 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Oh, it's been around
for over 100 years at least.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:51.980 align:middle line:10%
At least.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.950 align:middle line:10%
Probably, as you point out,
further back than that.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.350 align:middle line:10%
But are they likely to use it?

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:00.860 align:middle line:10%
Well, they're more likely
to use it if we're not

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.880 align:middle line:10%
adamant about recognizing it.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, think of-- what was it?

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:10.520 align:middle line:84%
The 6th of August,
1945, Hiroshima, Japan.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.690 align:middle line:84%
That was evidence of
nuclear power plants.

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.400 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: No, nuclear power plants
did not destroy Hiroshima,

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.960 align:middle line:10%
but it was evidence
you could use it

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.210 align:middle line:10%
for nuclear power plants.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:26.810 align:middle line:84%
What we saw in 9/11 was evidence
that free energy technology

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:27.880 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.740 align:middle line:10%
Not that that's
necessarily what was used,

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.680 align:middle line:10%
but if everyone realizes
that, nobody gets

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.030 align:middle line:10%
dustified developing it
in their own basement,

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:38.900 align:middle line:10%
if it's understood.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So many people have had
this episode change their lives

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and will never be the
same for it, at all.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.310 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: It's
terrifying, but you have

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.362 align:middle line:10%
to be wanting to
deal with the truth.

00:46:53.362 --> 00:46:55.320 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, it's
terrifying to deal with it,

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.615 align:middle line:10%
but that's what it is.

00:46:57.615 --> 00:47:01.384 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Will anything ever
stop you for seeking the truth?

00:47:01.384 --> 00:47:03.300 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: No, I think the
truth is so important.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.320 align:middle line:10%
And that's what really is needed
to change our culture is get

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.610 align:middle line:10%
back to not how to benefit from
something, but what's right

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.050 align:middle line:10%
and what's wrong.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.540 align:middle line:10%
What's truth and what's not.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:19.820 align:middle line:10%
And just go with what's truth,
not necessarily what's popular.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:23.540 align:middle line:10%
But what's interesting about
that video, people often ask,

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.690 align:middle line:10%
is this peer reviewed?

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:27.190 align:middle line:10%
That was an engineer
who happened

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:29.690 align:middle line:10%
to buy my book who was
so impressed that he

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:30.490 align:middle line:10%
made that video.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:31.845 align:middle line:90%
It blew his mind.

00:47:31.845 --> 00:47:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It blew his mind.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.534 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: He made it
totally on his own.

00:47:34.534 --> 00:47:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People
like Richard Gage,

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:84%
from Architects
and Engineers, who

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.140 align:middle line:84%
have similar thoughts
about what happened,

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:90%
and how those towers came down.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And they do not accept
the official story.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Do they support you at all?

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.300 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: No.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:49.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They do not.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:51.370 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: They
misrepresent my work

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:54.820 align:middle line:10%
and say I'm talking about
laser beams from outer space.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.020 align:middle line:10%
You know, something that--

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.495 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yet they believe
something else happened,

00:47:58.495 --> 00:47:59.370 align:middle line:10%
which is interesting.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:47:59.660 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:00.460 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.890 align:middle line:10%
If you don't like the lie
behind door number one,

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:05.197 align:middle line:10%
let's show you the lie
behind door number two.

00:48:05.197 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:10%
And that's what's popular.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.292 align:middle line:10%
And you go with group-think
and then, you know,

00:48:08.292 --> 00:48:10.000 align:middle line:10%
that's another lesson
to learn from this.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.500 align:middle line:10%
There's so many lessons.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.120 align:middle line:10%
It's important.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:15.490 align:middle line:10%
I forgot who it was--
it was Mark Twain.

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:18.070 align:middle line:10%
"If you find yourself
in the majority,

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.154 align:middle line:10%
it's time to pause
and reconsider."

00:48:20.154 --> 00:48:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think your
book "Where Did the Towers Go?"

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:84%
will ever be used in
schools and classrooms?

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.350 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Oh, I would hope so.

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:28.670 align:middle line:90%
And let people take it apart.

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It will take
a gutsy school board

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and educator, I think, to
bring this to the forefront.

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:38.420 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: And you're going to
have parents and all sorts

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.790 align:middle line:10%
of political things--

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:43.490 align:middle line:10%
they're already teaching
politics in elementary schools.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.560 align:middle line:10%
But Montessori schools,
it would be great.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.270 align:middle line:10%
Or home schools, because
you're allowed to think.

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:52.250 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
so important--

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:53.950 align:middle line:10%
to teach people to think.

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you don't
point fingers at who,

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.340 align:middle line:90%
you point fingers at what.

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.110 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's important.

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:04.340 align:middle line:84%
What you're pointing out is that
the official version did not

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:05.640 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.910 align:middle line:10%
This is what happened,
in my opinion.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:12.620 align:middle line:10%
But I don't see you running
around the country saying,

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.810 align:middle line:10%
this person did it,
this person did it.

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:15.610 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Oh, no.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:18.068 align:middle line:10%
And anyone who does that is
irresponsible because you first

00:49:18.068 --> 00:49:19.640 align:middle line:10%
have to determine
what it was that

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.320 align:middle line:10%
happened before you
can say who did it.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.650 align:middle line:10%
You have to define what it was.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So those who say 9/11 was an
inside job, well, what was it?

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:30.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:49:30.855 --> 00:49:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And what do you mean by inside?

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.638 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm opposed
to that, by the way.

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:36.320 align:middle line:84%
When they say it's
an inside job,

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:39.280 align:middle line:84%
it makes it sound like our
own government did it, and--

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Finger pointing.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that is ludicrous,
as far as I am concerned.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.220 align:middle line:84%
However, there are rogue
factions within this country--

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: As we see.

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --within
China, within Russia,

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:53.870 align:middle line:84%
that are manipulating
and controlling things.

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think these are
part of the groups that

00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:00.330 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for doing
these horrendous things.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Very much in
our perception, it's--

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:06.610 align:middle line:84%
it's like I have to
say about energy.

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:09.280 align:middle line:84%
He who controls the energy
controls the people.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.650 align:middle line:84%
But he who controls their
perception controls everything.

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And what do they want
with all of this, Judy?

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Some people like power.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.128 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think that's it?

00:50:20.128 --> 00:50:22.580 align:middle line:84%
They've got more power than
they have, than they need?

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're bored?

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I cannot understand.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.541 align:middle line:84%
I don't see it from
that perspective.

00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I like to live life,
and go explore life,

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:29.297 align:middle line:84%
and learn about the
world around me.

00:50:29.297 --> 00:50:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, do you think
they were doing high-fives

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:34.570 align:middle line:84%
when they were watching
this tragedy on 9/11?

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:36.549 align:middle line:84%
Did they enjoy this
horrible moment?

00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: When we see the-- heys!

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.170 align:middle line:90%
See!

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:38.770 align:middle line:90%
I was right!

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:39.190 align:middle line:90%
I was right!

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:40.690 align:middle line:10%
It was better than I
thought it would be.

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:41.690 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:42.940 align:middle line:10%
I have no idea.

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How have they been
able to keep it a secret,

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:46.930 align:middle line:90%
in your opinion?

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Compartmentalization.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:53.830 align:middle line:10%
Also, if people have
a vested interest

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:55.480 align:middle line:10%
in keeping it a secret.

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.400 align:middle line:10%
For example, professors
who have, you know,

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:10%
basically graded on how much
grant money they get in.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:04.660 align:middle line:10%
If they get in grant money to
develop fly-and-spy gizmos,

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.820 align:middle line:10%
airport security
devices, are they

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.130 align:middle line:10%
going to want to
talk about the truth?

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:10.880 align:middle line:84%
This will take away
their grant money.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's assume
you're at a conference,

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.980 align:middle line:84%
speaking before a crowd
of people about this.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Where did the towers go?

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:23.000 align:middle line:10%
And one person raises his or
her hand and says, Dr. Wood,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.290 align:middle line:10%
can you tell us
exactly what happened?

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.270 align:middle line:90%
What would your answer be?

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:32.406 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, I can show
that the material came apart.

00:51:32.406 --> 00:51:34.180 align:middle line:10%
It didn't slam to the ground.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.300 align:middle line:10%
It didn't burn up.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, I don't have anything
hitting something,

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:41.270 align:middle line:10%
so you can rule
out as the cause,

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:44.560 align:middle line:10%
the destructive mechanism, you
can rule out kinetic energy,

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:47.920 align:middle line:10%
and you can rule out thermal
energy, being the causes.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, as for any
conventional weapon,

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:52.560 align:middle line:90%
that eliminates anything.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's obviously
something unconventional.

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:57.930 align:middle line:10%
What I like to say
is, let's study this.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:58.730 align:middle line:90%
This is weird.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:59.563 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:51:59.563 --> 00:52:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's see this new phenomenon
that we haven't really

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.780 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to much
before, and look at it.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.480 align:middle line:10%
And that's one thing that I
was really disappointed in

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.910 align:middle line:10%
is that why government
officials didn't say, oh, wow--

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:14.300 align:middle line:10%
why don't we study this?

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Scary situation,
Judy, isn't it?

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.247 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:52:17.247 --> 00:52:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keep doing
what you're doing.

00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Thank you.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't give up.

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Judy, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.973 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Thanks so much for
having the courage to have me

00:52:24.973 --> 00:52:25.800 align:middle line:90%
here, too.

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.924 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does take guts.

00:52:26.924 --> 00:52:29.060 align:middle line:84%
It takes guts for Dr.
Judy Wood to continue

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.150 align:middle line:90%
doing what she's doing.

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I guess it takes
a little guts for us

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.340 align:middle line:84%
to give it that
opportunity as well.

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
