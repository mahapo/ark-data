00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.601 align:middle line:84%
>> [Background Music] I think
many people today don't know

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:02.803 align:middle line:90%
what to believe anymore.

00:00:02.803 --> 00:00:05.338 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically
going to keep on, up to a,

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.274 align:middle line:84%
help them cover what
really happened.

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:09.676 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.244 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:13.446 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.656 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: And welcome

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.424 align:middle line:84%
to another exciting
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.793 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory with
our special guest,

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:28.228 align:middle line:90%
Mary Ann Winkowski.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.231 align:middle line:84%
What's it like for you
to go to a funeral?

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.902 align:middle line:84%
And if you passed on, would you
actually go to your own funeral?

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:37.404 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Mary Ann Winkowski:
Everybody attends their funeral.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.309 align:middle line:90%
People like their funerals.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.147 align:middle line:84%
You walk into a funeral home and
you just pay your last respects.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.917 align:middle line:84%
Standing right here at the foot
of the casket is the spirit

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:55.055 align:middle line:90%
of whosever in the casket.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.657 align:middle line:84%
Now, the women will
check out their clothes,

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.659 align:middle line:90%
what their hair looks like.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.395 align:middle line:84%
They'll walk to both sides
of the casket, see

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:07.367 align:middle line:90%
who sent flowers, who didn't.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.302 align:middle line:90%
The guys, guys are funny.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:12.105 align:middle line:84%
Guys have to count how many
cars in the funeral procession

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.808 align:middle line:84%
to the cemetery,
the more the better.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.977 align:middle line:84%
Now the little prayer
service that the priest

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:20.747 align:middle line:84%
or the minister has,
most people will walk

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:90%
into that light at that point.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.219 align:middle line:84%
They are actually
seeing relatives

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.255 align:middle line:84%
that have died before
them or friends

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:31.558 align:middle line:84%
that are motioning,
come on, come on.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.594 align:middle line:84%
They can't talk to them
but they can see them.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.796 align:middle line:90%
But, if you don't want to go

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.666 align:middle line:84%
to that light you
do not have to go.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: With our special
guest Winkowski,

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:43.837 align:middle line:90%
we call her the ghost buster.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.505 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.408 align:middle line:84%
I like that guys actually count
the cars at their funeral?

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:49.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: They do.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:50.944 align:middle line:90%
It's a guy thing.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well, you know,

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:54.047 align:middle line:84%
I would probably hire
professional wailers

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.882 align:middle line:84%
to throw themselves
on the casket.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
That's what scared me

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.519 align:middle line:84%
when grandma started
taking me to funerals,

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.788 align:middle line:84%
not the person standing
at the foot of the casket.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:02.789 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: The other people.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
But the wailers,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.427 align:middle line:84%
I mean with the black
veils over their heads and.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They're professionals.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:09.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Yes, and you know,

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:14.434 align:middle line:84%
they don't really have them
anymore but back when, I'd go.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.836 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd hang on to her
and go what are they doing?

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:17.771 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with them?

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.472 align:middle line:84%
Why are they screaming
like that?

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.808 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the more
tears, the louder,

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:24.143 align:middle line:84%
the more you were loved and the
higher you were going to go.

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.112 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Absolutely,
you're a consultant to the

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:27.213 align:middle line:90%
"Ghost Whisperer" show?

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes.

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:28.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A CBS television show?

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:31.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How did that
all come about for you?

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:32.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
"The Medium"

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:33.954 align:middle line:84%
with Patty Arquette
had just come

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:37.157 align:middle line:84%
out so everybody was
scrambling to get something.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.224 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Like that.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Similar, correct.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.927 align:middle line:90%
Timing is everything.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It sure is.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:46.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And
so James Van Praagh knew me.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Mmm, great medium.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:48.969 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: He is.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.306 align:middle line:84%
And so he gave my name to
John Gray.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Okay.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:55.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Who
was the producer of the show

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:59.379 align:middle line:84%
and we met in a coffee
shop, a Starbucks,

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.549 align:middle line:84%
in Hollywood, only
Hollywood and.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You flew
up from Cleveland?

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Yes, well we had,

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.953 align:middle line:84%
actually were staying
in Santa Monica,

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.856 align:middle line:90%
trying to get a show bought.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:10.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Okay.

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
And so, and John goes,

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.560 align:middle line:90%
is there anybody in here?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.996 align:middle line:84%
And I says, yes, sitting
over there on that couch

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and over there, which for the
people that are so devoted

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.003 align:middle line:84%
to "Ghost Whisperer" the
beginning of the show,

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:25.505 align:middle line:90%
that scene is actually in it.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:27.941 align:middle line:90%
And so he walked out of there.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.277 align:middle line:84%
He had always done shows,
movies of the week and that kind

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.446 align:middle line:84%
of thing and he wanted to
do a television series.

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:34.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:36.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Before
he got in his car he called

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.318 align:middle line:84%
who he had to call and
he said, let's go for it.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.319 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And they did it?

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: And they did it.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Just like that.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Five years.

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.323 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's amazing how
Hollywood works sometimes

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:44.256 align:middle line:90%
if you're with the right people.

00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:45.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
You know,

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:45.625 align:middle line:90%
there's no rhyme or reason.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.826 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.228 align:middle line:84%
You have to, like I said,
right time, right place.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: No sequel?

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.098 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Not that I know of.

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:55.402 align:middle line:84%
I mean they actually wanted to
go longer than the five years

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:84%
but Love wanted to
be done with it.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: She wanted.

00:03:58.338 --> 00:03:59.039 align:middle line:90%
She wanted something else.

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: And she's got

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.241 align:middle line:90%
a baby coming next month now.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.576 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How are people
reacting these days

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.878 align:middle line:90%
to spirits and ghosts?

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:06.946 align:middle line:84%
I mean are people
still fascinated by it?

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:08.148 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell?

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:09.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: There's a big
difference.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:14.287 align:middle line:84%
Even if, when I gave a lecture
10 or 15 years ago the audience

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:19.893 align:middle line:84%
of 100 people would be 99
women and 1 man and halfway

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:22.829 align:middle line:84%
through the wife is
going, wake up, wake up.

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:28.535 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do an audience of
4 or 5, 600, half are men

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:31.071 align:middle line:84%
and men have better
questions than women.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:32.405 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's
interesting.

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: You
know, it's like, again, 10,

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:38.344 align:middle line:84%
15 years ago, if you went to
a party and you told somebody,

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:41.848 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think I've
got a ghost in the house.

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:44.918 align:middle line:84%
And they'd go, oh, yeah
she's ready for the.

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:45.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:46.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Cookie factory.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Time for us to go.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.788 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Now you go to a party
and you say, yeah,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.525 align:middle line:84%
I think I've got a
ghost in the house.

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:54.461 align:middle line:90%
Why? And you tell them.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:59.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do people have you
show up at ghost buster parties?

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.301 align:middle line:84%
that's not something
I would even do.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You don't do that?

00:05:02.202 --> 00:05:02.769 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: No.

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:04.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Okay.

00:05:04.104 --> 00:05:06.673 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: You know,
I've got to put a line

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.709 align:middle line:90%
between entertainment and work.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Right, there's
a fine line there.

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: There
is, there is.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.117 align:middle line:84%
My entertainment I think it's
enough when I do all the talks

00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:21.421 align:middle line:84%
that I give and people ask
questions and it goes on.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:25.225 align:middle line:84%
I mean my, two hours is
the minimum talk I give.

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:27.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Wow, I used to
remember my grandmother,

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:29.963 align:middle line:84%
growing up in the
Fitchburg, Massachusetts.

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:32.232 align:middle line:90%
She would have, and they had.

00:05:32.232 --> 00:05:34.334 align:middle line:84%
The living room they
called the parlor then.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:35.335 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:37.836 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And she had
all her girlfriends there

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:38.938 align:middle line:90%
and family members.

00:05:38.938 --> 00:05:40.039 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Seance.

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they were
doing a tea reading.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.112 align:middle line:90%
Everybody would drink tea

00:05:46.112 --> 00:05:49.115 align:middle line:84%
and in those days they had
the actual leaves in the tea.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:52.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And when the tea
was finished they looked

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:54.554 align:middle line:90%
at where the leaves were.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:55.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah.

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:58.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They had some old
lady there look at these things

00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:00.426 align:middle line:90%
and go, this is your future.

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:01.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: She'd be
like a psychic lady.

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:03.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: But they loved it.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:06.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And they
would do it every week.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:07.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:08.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I didn't
like it as a kid.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was freaky.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Right, well the
table movings

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:15.008 align:middle line:84%
and raising the table and
seances were big, you know,

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:16.576 align:middle line:84%
where people would sit
around and have seances.

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:21.047 align:middle line:84%
And see , and I put that
in the same category

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.348 align:middle line:90%
with the Ouija board.

00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:24.818 align:middle line:84%
You're calling them in and
I think you could be asking

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:26.853 align:middle line:90%
for trouble like that.

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:30.423 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why didn't I
like it as a little boy?

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:31.824 align:middle line:90%
Why was I scared?

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:33.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Because
there was probably just enough

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.062 align:middle line:84%
energy in there that
made you uncomfortable.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Maybe so.

00:06:37.297 --> 00:06:38.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And
kids are sensitive.

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I also didn't like
the little, old reader lady.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Her
voice was a little too raspy?

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:43.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: She was like a witch.

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:45.038 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:46.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: She might
have been a nice lady.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.941 align:middle line:84%
but your perception
of her wasn't good.

00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:49.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: She's dead now

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:51.377 align:middle line:84%
and she's probably here
watching this show.

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:52.612 align:middle line:90%
Do you sense anything?

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Not today.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do you
sense a spirit here?

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: There was

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.182 align:middle line:90%
a couple here when I walked in.

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:57.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Really?

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:58.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Two men, yes,
yeah, yeah.

00:06:58.484 --> 00:06:59.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Would they have?

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:02.755 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a relatively new
building, a new studio out here

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:08.127 align:middle line:84%
so would they have died on
the land that was here before

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:10.296 align:middle line:84%
in terms of whatever
the building was

00:07:10.296 --> 00:07:12.465 align:middle line:90%
or why are they here?

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:13.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: They could have
followed any

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.768 align:middle line:84%
of the workers in and maybe they
were just going to go with them

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.136 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day.

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.438 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So they could
be from someplace else?

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.672 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:21.107 align:middle line:84%
They could have come in with
one of your other guests

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.209 align:middle line:84%
and thought oh,
interesting place.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:24.711 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll stay for a while.

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:27.113 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to tell
them they can't stay?

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.015 align:middle line:90%
They can do anything they want.

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:29.949 align:middle line:90%
It's.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, you
will tell them.

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:32.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah,
but it's an old wives' tale.

00:07:32.884 --> 00:07:34.586 align:middle line:84%
They had to have
lived in the house.

00:07:34.586 --> 00:07:37.457 align:middle line:90%
They had to own the house.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:42.095 align:middle line:84%
Oh and the one I love the
best, the house is built

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:43.663 align:middle line:90%
on an Indian burial ground.

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:46.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I love
those or cemetery.

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Never, never,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.936 align:middle line:84%
I've never found a house built
on an Indian burial ground.

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:52.238 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, I bet
they have been somewhere.

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:53.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Back,

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.842 align:middle line:84%
way back when, Indians
moved with.

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:56.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A cabin.

00:07:56.843 --> 00:07:57.844 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: With, you know.

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:59.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Did they
dig up their dead?

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: They burned

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.248 align:middle line:90%
most of them or they were.

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:05.151 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So you don't think
there is an Indian burial ground

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.452 align:middle line:90%
with a house built on it?

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:09.222 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I've actually been
to Indian burial grounds

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:12.191 align:middle line:84%
where there are actual
Indians buried but you know,

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:14.694 align:middle line:84%
there could have been
a war in your backyard

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:17.397 align:middle line:84%
and an Indian got killed and
there's a house built on it

00:08:17.397 --> 00:08:19.999 align:middle line:90%
but native American Indians,

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.534 align:middle line:84%
they have a different
belief system.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.803 align:middle line:84%
Some of them stay to
protect Mother Earth.

00:08:23.803 --> 00:08:24.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Sure.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: You remember

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.274 align:middle line:84%
that commercial a number of
years ago, it was for litter?

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:29.841 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: The crying Indian.

00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:30.909 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes, yes,

00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:33.079 align:middle line:84%
that's such a perfect
example of them.

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:35.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That was a
great, emotional commercial.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.548 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: It sure was,

00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:38.384 align:middle line:84%
especially when I've seen
Indians that look like that.

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:38.952 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It said it all.

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:39.953 align:middle line:90%
It said it all.

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.654 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:43.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: There was a
story of a little girl

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:46.292 align:middle line:84%
who would tell her parents
that she had a friend

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:50.697 align:middle line:84%
and the friend kept telling
them, kept telling her

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:54.534 align:middle line:84%
that she was buried
under the floor.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.136 align:middle line:84%
And the little girl
told her parents.

00:08:57.136 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
They thought that
was very unusual.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.109 align:middle line:90%
They had the floor ripped up.

00:09:03.109 --> 00:09:04.344 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Good,
I would have too.

00:09:04.344 --> 00:09:05.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And there were
the bones of a little girl.

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:06.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Listen
to the kids.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:07.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:09.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Listen
to your children.

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:14.053 align:middle line:84%
Most kids don't know
how to lie about something.

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:15.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So the
little girl was killed.

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:16.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah
and her spirit was still there.

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:17.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: The spirit was there.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:18.725 align:middle line:90%
It did not rest.

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:19.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.393 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And would not rest.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right.

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:22.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Until they
found those bones.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:23.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And then
she was at peace.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:31.003 align:middle line:84%
Well, people have a perceived
idea of what they want

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:34.607 align:middle line:84%
and how they want to go
out and if it changes,

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:38.544 align:middle line:90%
like people live longer now.

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:41.914 align:middle line:84%
So mom dies and she's
96 years old and all

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:46.018 align:middle line:84%
of her friends are dead and
funerals are so expensive now.

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:48.621 align:middle line:84%
Ah, we're not going to have a
funeral, we'll just cremate her.

00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:51.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I want to look at one
of your videos on a casket story

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:53.659 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll come and
react to it afterwards.

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.027 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: This
lady called me up and she says,

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:58.998 align:middle line:84%
my husband died and
she says I need you

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:00.867 align:middle line:90%
to really come to the funeral.

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:02.368 align:middle line:90%
And I said, okay.

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And I walk in and I
was like, I was so amazed.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:13.379 align:middle line:84%
There's the casket leaning
upright against the wall,

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:15.681 align:middle line:84%
funerals, with flowers,
on both sides

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.683 align:middle line:84%
and I don't really know
who these people are.

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:20.353 align:middle line:84%
They recognized me so
his wife came up to me.

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:22.889 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, thank you, thank
you for coming and I said,

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:24.991 align:middle line:90%
what's that all about?

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:26.893 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't understand.

00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:33.232 align:middle line:84%
She goes, well, he always and
she says, no, let him tell you.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.034 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:37.003 align:middle line:90%
So his name was Joe.

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:38.004 align:middle line:90%
I said, hey Joe.

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:40.206 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's this all about?

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:41.274 align:middle line:90%
And he started laughing.

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:44.243 align:middle line:84%
He says, 37 years
we were married.

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
The first time she
ever listened to me.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:90%
I said, about what?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.488 align:middle line:84%
He said, I told her I
never wanted to be laid

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:58.591 align:middle line:90%
out in a funeral home.

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:00.626 align:middle line:90%
So she stood him up.

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:02.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I love that story.

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:03.029 align:middle line:90%
I love that story.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:04.764 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen a lot?

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:06.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Funerals are
getting a little

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:06.866 align:middle line:90%
weirder now.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:07.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:09.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I have to admit.

00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:12.405 align:middle line:84%
I went to a funeral not that
long ago and there was a lot

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:90%
of cars there and I walked in

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.108 align:middle line:84%
and you know how
there's different rooms

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:19.412 align:middle line:84%
for different viewings depending
on how many bodies they have,

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:84%
walked in and there was like
a -- there was a big-screen TV

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.885 align:middle line:84%
on the wall and there
was a football game going

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:28.521 align:middle line:84%
on which I thought was
strange because it was summer.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:29.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:31.424 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And
people walking around,

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:35.027 align:middle line:84%
holding the beer and
pretzels and I thought hah,

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:37.763 align:middle line:84%
so I kept on walking
and there was nothing.

00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So I backed up and there was
no little plaque on the side

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.270 align:middle line:84%
with the name of the person and
I walked in and this woman walks

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.872 align:middle line:84%
up and she goes, oh
thank you for coming.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.674 align:middle line:90%
I said, this is it?

00:11:48.674 --> 00:11:51.644 align:middle line:90%
This is. I says was he created?

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:52.879 align:middle line:90%
She goes, no.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:55.648 align:middle line:90%
I said, well where is he?

00:11:55.648 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
She goes, in the recliner with
the remote in his hand, with.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Never changed,
never changed.

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: She said,
this makes,

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.691 align:middle line:90%
and he was happy, happy, happy.

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:06.792 align:middle line:90%
That's what he wanted.

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:08.561 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: My father
died about two years ago --

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah?

00:12:09.896 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: -- to this month and
he has yet to make contact.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.468 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: You
haven't dreamt of him yet?

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:16.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Haven't dreamt of him.

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:20.506 align:middle line:90%
We were very close but why?

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing he's already
skedaddled to the other side.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And
that's why you would dream

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:27.880 align:middle line:90%
of him because only people

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.182 align:middle line:84%
that have crossed
over come in dreams.

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:32.752 align:middle line:84%
But you gave me a hint
why he hasn't come to you.

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:33.953 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why?

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:35.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: First of
all it could take

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:84%
up to two years so you're
right at that two-year mark

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.527 align:middle line:84%
but more important, if you were
that close to him he might think

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:44.163 align:middle line:84%
that you would get too upset
if you saw him in a dream

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:45.998 align:middle line:84%
and he wouldn't want
to do that to you.

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:48.568 align:middle line:84%
Have any of your other
relatives dreamt of him yet?

00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:49.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Nope, nope, not yet.

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:51.237 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not true.

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:52.538 align:middle line:90%
My daughter has.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:53.906 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Then
he has definitely crossed

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:58.044 align:middle line:84%
over so he's just afraid it's
going to upset you too much.

00:12:58.044 --> 00:12:59.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He went quick.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:02.515 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean died I mean the way
he just went to the other side.

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:05.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah,
oh I'm sure he was there

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
for the viewing but
he would have crossed

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.621 align:middle line:84%
over as soon
as the service was over.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I mean I know when
I go, I want to just move.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.558 align:middle line:90%
I want to take off.

00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:90%
I want to go do my thing.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.395 align:middle line:90%
I want a new adventure.

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:18.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Well,
I'm not going to stick around.

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:19.498 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to lose my light.

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:21.334 align:middle line:90%
I will cross over.

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:23.336 align:middle line:84%
I will stick around
for my funeral though.

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:25.237 align:middle line:84%
I just need to hear what
everybody's going to say.

00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:26.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are you going
to have some spirits

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:31.677 align:middle line:84%
when you cross over, say, you
were the one that chased me out?

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I've
been wondering about that.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.216 align:middle line:84%
I've tricked some people
into the light,

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:41.787 align:middle line:84%
and I wonder how many people
are just going to do that.

00:13:41.787 --> 00:13:43.189 align:middle line:84%
I've actually thought
about that.

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:45.191 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking that
about three years ago.

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:46.258 align:middle line:90%
It's like yah.

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how many
people are going to be.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well, you know it's

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:51.897 align:middle line:84%
like a prosecutor
who ends up in jail.

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:52.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: [Laugh] I know it.

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or a cop.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: But it's
the white light.

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:56.402 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
good, I know it.

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:57.269 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's funny.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:58.971 align:middle line:90%
What is an earthbound spirit?

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:01.207 align:middle line:84%
I think I know but I
want to hear it from you.

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: A
person that chooses not to go

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.378 align:middle line:90%
into that light when they die.

00:14:05.378 --> 00:14:10.149 align:middle line:84%
Now that light will stay with
you for about 48 to 72 hours

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:13.486 align:middle line:84%
after your final
memorial service

00:14:13.486 --> 00:14:16.522 align:middle line:84%
which actually gives you
enough time to go scooting

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.224 align:middle line:84%
through people's
houses and be nosey.

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:20.726 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to know you're
there but that light is going

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:22.361 align:middle line:84%
to start getting
smaller and smaller

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:23.829 align:middle line:90%
and if you don't go into it.

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:24.964 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Is it like a tunnel?

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Sort
of like that, yeah.

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:27.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's closing.

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:28.334 align:middle line:90%
A portal?

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:29.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Right
and if you don't go

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:30.002 align:middle line:90%
into it, it disappears.

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:31.437 align:middle line:90%
Now you're stuck.

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:32.304 align:middle line:90%
Those are the ones I --

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:33.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh, for how long?

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Till
you can find somebody like me

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
that can make the
white light for you or --

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.178 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I see, a new opening.

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:42.214 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: -- pr, you
decide you're going to stick

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:46.519 align:middle line:84%
around and give somebody grief
which I wouldn't recommend.

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:50.322 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
go to a funeral home

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:53.025 align:middle line:90%
that has a service going on.

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:56.128 align:middle line:84%
That bright, white light that's
around that spirit, you do not.

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:57.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You go with them?

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:58.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
You do not, right.

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:00.232 align:middle line:84%
It's not an individual light,
it's a universal light.

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A little piggy back?

00:15:01.434 --> 00:15:02.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Just bebop into that light

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:03.602 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be where
you need to be.

00:15:03.602 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I love it.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.204 align:middle line:90%
You're not a witch.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:06.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I am not.

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But you
know about curses?

00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I do.

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:11.177 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What are you
doing learning about curses?

00:15:11.177 --> 00:15:12.578 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.214 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Well, my
grandmother that taught me all

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:18.684 align:middle line:84%
of this, was the one
that knew how to put

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:20.986 align:middle line:84%
and take off the
maloik which is --

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:22.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What's a maloik?

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:23.456 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: -- which
is the curse, the Italian curse.

00:15:23.456 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Ah.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Okay, there's the Greek.

00:15:26.192 --> 00:15:27.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Winkowski is Polish.

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:29.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Well my husband is Polish.

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Ah, that's
how it happened.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
That's how that happened but,

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:36.168 align:middle line:84%
and the Greeks have
the evil eye and then

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:38.137 align:middle line:84%
in Louisiana we've
got Voodoo and --

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:40.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The Middle Easterns,
they've got the djinn.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's exactly,

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:44.744 align:middle line:84%
every nationality has a
curse or negative energy.

00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:46.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:47.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: However you want
to look at it

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:53.252 align:middle line:84%
and so she thought it was part
of my learning to learn how

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:55.955 align:middle line:84%
to do that, to take it
off and to put it on

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:58.324 align:middle line:84%
and I've got a bad enough
temper where I didn't want

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.692 align:middle line:90%
to really learn how to put it

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:02.595 align:middle line:84%
on because I could just see me
accidently popping something

00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:03.796 align:middle line:90%
out of my mouth.

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:09.969 align:middle line:84%
But, as it turned out no
matter which nationality,

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.671 align:middle line:84%
whether it's wish-craft
or witchcraft

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:16.475 align:middle line:84%
or whoever puts the
negative energy on you,

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:18.377 align:middle line:84%
it can all be taken
off the same way.

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:21.847 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do you know
that you've been cursed?

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:22.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: You know,

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:25.484 align:middle line:90%
if you get people going, ah.

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:27.453 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Because if
somebody runs into,

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:29.955 align:middle line:90%
let's say a string of bad luck.

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.157 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right.

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:32.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How do we know
somebody hasn't cursed them?

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:35.094 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: That's
right and the thing is, well,

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:37.329 align:middle line:84%
if I didn't have bad luck
I wouldn't have any luck.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.965 align:middle line:84%
I have a black cloud
over the top of my head.

00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:41.834 align:middle line:90%
I'm the born loser.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.102 align:middle line:90%
Oh please, get over it.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.403 align:middle line:90%
It can be taken care of.

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:49.141 align:middle line:84%
You can fix that
and three things,

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:52.845 align:middle line:84%
if you think you have a curse
on you it can affect one

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:56.015 align:middle line:84%
of these three things,
two or all three

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:59.819 align:middle line:84%
and in no particular order,
health, money, relationships.

00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:00.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Bang, bang, bang.

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.221 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
And if it's any one

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:84%
of those things you could
have negative energy on you.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What about the
person who gives the curse?

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that going to
bite them eventually?

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I think
what goes around comes around.

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:11.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's karma, right?

00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:13.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Exactly
right, I will have a person sit

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:15.434 align:middle line:84%
in front of me and
I'll say are you ready

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:16.836 align:middle line:90%
to have me take the curse off?

00:17:16.836 --> 00:17:20.105 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go, oh yeah, but I
want you to increase it tenfold

00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:22.107 align:middle line:84%
and send it back
to who put it on.

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:25.911 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, no, I'm not
ruining my karma for you.

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:27.213 align:middle line:90%
I send it out to the universe

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.315 align:middle line:84%
and let the universe
take care of it.

00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:31.150 align:middle line:90%
I am not the curse police.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.585 align:middle line:90%
That's not my job.

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:35.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: If somebody,
a curse is always bad?

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:36.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: It's
negative energy.

00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:37.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It is negative energy?

00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:38.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah, it is.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:42.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: As opposed to a spell
which could be positive, right?

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:43.229 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Correct,
absolutely.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:45.431 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely correct.

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:49.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The person who puts
the curse on you, do they have

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:52.905 align:middle line:84%
to go to someone
who has that ability

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:90%
or they can do it on their own?

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: They can
do it on their own.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Do they need a lock
of your hair or anything?

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: They do not.

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:03.682 align:middle line:84%
That would make it a stronger
one but say you have a neighbor

00:18:03.682 --> 00:18:05.851 align:middle line:84%
and you and him have been
fighting over the property line

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:84%
for the last ten years and every
time you look out your window,

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.889 align:middle line:90%
you go, oh you son-of-a-gun.

00:18:09.889 --> 00:18:10.956 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I want you bad.

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.358 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:15.761 align:middle line:84%
That's enough negative energy
to affect him to some point,

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:20.032 align:middle line:84%
not as much as if you went to
a storefront and found a gypsy

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:21.967 align:middle line:84%
for $5 to have them
put a curse on him.

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:23.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Sure, but
eventually won't it come back

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:24.236 align:middle line:90%
and get them too?

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:25.004 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: It will.

00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:26.572 align:middle line:90%
It will, absolutely, yeah.

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:90%
I truly believe that.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.776 align:middle line:84%
And then as we know
there's organizations

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:35.281 align:middle line:84%
that have curses on them and,
but anything can be removed.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.783 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Now I understand you
brought us some little presents

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:38.617 align:middle line:90%
to look at?

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:39.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I did.

00:18:39.552 --> 00:18:40.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Smudge
sticks and things

00:18:40.386 --> 00:18:41.654 align:middle line:90%
which you're going to explain.

00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:43.289 align:middle line:84%
But how do you get
rid of a ghost?

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.657 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:18:44.657 --> 00:18:47.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: The
first thing you want to do is

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:50.396 align:middle line:84%
if you are affiliated
with any kind

00:18:50.396 --> 00:18:55.334 align:middle line:84%
of a religious organization
have an ordained priest

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:58.637 align:middle line:84%
or minister come in
and bless the house.

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:02.608 align:middle line:84%
Do not get your hands
on holy water

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:05.744 align:middle line:84%
and start throwing
holy water around.

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:08.213 align:middle line:84%
That's going to make
them very angry.

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:09.748 align:middle line:90%
Do not do that.

00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:13.819 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that you can do
is get what is called a smudge

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:17.456 align:middle line:90%
stick, S-M-U-D-G-E.

00:19:17.456 --> 00:19:20.426 align:middle line:84%
It's made out of
sage or sweet grass.

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:24.763 align:middle line:84%
That's actually what Native
American Indians use to get rid

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:27.967 align:middle line:84%
of unwanted spirits
or negative energy.

00:19:27.967 --> 00:19:29.201 align:middle line:90%
This will work.

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:31.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: This will work
so let's take a look

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:32.705 align:middle line:90%
at some of the little things.

00:19:32.705 --> 00:19:34.073 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: This
is a smudge stick and its' made

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.742 align:middle line:90%
out of sage and sweet grass.

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:37.943 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Okay.

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:38.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And
there's some lavender

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:39.611 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that in it and.

00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:40.946 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: You can smell it too.

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:42.481 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes you can.

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.216 align:middle line:84%
And if you light
that and blow it

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:45.784 align:middle line:90%
out like you would an incence.

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Light it, right
and then blow it right out?

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.188 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Blow
it out, it'll start smoking.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.322 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Then it
smokes and crackles.

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:51.724 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
And that's what you go

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:84%
around the perimeter of every
room in the house with and that,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.229 align:middle line:84%
if the ghost hasn't
been there very long,

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:59.164 align:middle line:90%
that will get them to move on.

00:19:59.164 --> 00:19:59.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why?

00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:00.599 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:01.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: They don't like

00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:03.168 align:middle line:90%
the energy from the smoke.

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:06.071 align:middle line:84%
It affects their energy
so they will leave.

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:11.143 align:middle line:84%
If they choose to stay this
will make them very lethargic,

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:13.912 align:middle line:84%
very laid back and the house
is going to feel better.

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:15.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Huh.

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:16.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: The
trick to this is though,

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:17.983 align:middle line:84%
it's got to be done at
least every two weeks.

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:19.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Every two
weeks and it must be

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:21.453 align:middle line:90%
through with sage, right?

00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:22.554 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Sage
or sweet grass.

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:23.789 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or sweet grass, okay.

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:24.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes, absolutely.

00:20:24.757 --> 00:20:25.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Alright.

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:26.992 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Yeah, but that's definitely

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:29.228 align:middle line:84%
and the same thing
with dreaming.

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:33.465 align:middle line:84%
People that don't remember their
dreams because everybody dreams,

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:36.802 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't remember the
dreams you can get an herb

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
called mugwort and you put
this between your pillowcase

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.608 align:middle line:90%
and your pillow and in

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:44.843 align:middle line:84%
about three weeks you'll
start remembering your dreams.

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.211 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I can attest.

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:49.181 align:middle line:84%
Mary Ann, about a year and a
half ago send me a little packet

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:53.218 align:middle line:84%
of mugwort, much like this and
I just threw it in the pillow,

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
what the heck and I had
the wildest dreams ever.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.692 align:middle line:90%
Does it do that too?

00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:03.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah,
very vivid, Technicolor?

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:04.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah.

00:21:04.897 --> 00:21:05.731 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes, very strong.

00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:06.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right.

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:07.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Very loud.

00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:08.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
And you remember them?

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:09.968 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes, you do.

00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Very loud.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
That's the whole purpose.

00:21:12.304 --> 00:21:14.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Some of them
border on nightmarish.

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:15.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Because they're loud

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:15.974 align:middle line:90%
and you're not used to it.

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:16.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:21:16.975 --> 00:21:18.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right, right.

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:22.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And then I took the
mugwort out and I went back

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.882 align:middle line:84%
to some kind of normal
dream cycle.

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:24.716 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right, right.

00:21:24.716 --> 00:21:26.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: How does that work?

00:21:26.085 --> 00:21:27.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Well,

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:32.758 align:middle line:84%
because the mugwort helps you
remember and in my little pouch,

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's
lavender and stuff

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.862 align:middle line:84%
that actually helps
promote sleep

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:38.564 align:middle line:84%
which some people have
a hard time sleeping.

00:21:38.564 --> 00:21:44.136 align:middle line:84%
And it's just, people that
really, really want to talk

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:46.171 align:middle line:90%
to a deceased relative.

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:49.141 align:middle line:84%
If they can start remembering
their dreams so that,

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:52.411 align:middle line:84%
when that relative comes, then
you can have a conversation

00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:53.378 align:middle line:90%
with that person.

00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:54.646 align:middle line:84%
If you can't remember
your dreams,

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:55.647 align:middle line:90%
that's never going to happen.

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:57.216 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I love
that, that's exciting.

00:21:57.216 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: It is.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I think in your
dream-state you can do all kinds

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:01.954 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:03.088 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Anything you want, anything.

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:04.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Anything.

00:22:04.223 --> 00:22:05.424 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
If you have a problem,

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:06.692 align:middle line:84%
think about it before
you go to sleep at night.

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:07.993 align:middle line:84%
You get up in the morning
and you've got the answer.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:08.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's solved.

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:09.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:22:09.762 --> 00:22:10.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Take care of it.

00:22:10.763 --> 00:22:11.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: It's all you.

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:12.231 align:middle line:90%
We can all do it.

00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:13.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: A relationship, a job.

00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:14.399 align:middle line:84%
Just go to sleep and let your
subconscious do all the work

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:15.601 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:16.902 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Exactly right, absolutely.

00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:20.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Sometimes in our
human form we try too hard.

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:21.907 align:middle line:90%
We push too hard.

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:22.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: We overthink it,

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:24.276 align:middle line:90%
looking for too many angles.

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:25.377 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And it doesn't work.

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:26.445 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:27.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: You can't do that.

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:90%
The dream-state is.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Just let it happen.

00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:29.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Innocent, it just happens.

00:22:29.982 --> 00:22:30.682 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:31.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Let it happen.

00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:32.384 align:middle line:90%
I mean I love that.

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:34.386 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:36.889 align:middle line:90%
You specialize in ghost-busting.

00:22:36.889 --> 00:22:37.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Correct.

00:22:37.823 --> 00:22:38.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But you're
into dreams.

00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:39.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes.

00:22:39.792 --> 00:22:41.426 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You're
into battling curses.

00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:42.561 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes.

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:45.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What's next
for Mary Ann Winkowski?

00:22:45.898 --> 00:22:48.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I
enjoy writing and I think

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:51.303 align:middle line:84%
that the more information
that is out there

00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:84%
when you have knowledge,
you're not afraid and like

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.775 align:middle line:90%
with the curses for instance,

00:22:56.775 --> 00:22:59.211 align:middle line:84%
in the one book the
whole last chapter

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:84%
in the one book is
how to remove a curse.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.215 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do it.

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:03.982 align:middle line:90%
I was taught how --

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:04.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: For themselves?

00:23:04.983 --> 00:23:05.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
For themselves.

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:07.386 align:middle line:90%
I was taught how to do it.

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:08.854 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:11.823 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have time to help
people with curses anymore.

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:15.494 align:middle line:84%
Take care of it yourself and
you do it to your husband.

00:23:15.494 --> 00:23:18.263 align:middle line:84%
Let him do the little ceremony
to you and it's taken care of.

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:19.932 align:middle line:90%
If you don't have a curse

00:23:19.932 --> 00:23:22.568 align:middle line:84%
and you did a little ceremony
you're not going to get one.

00:23:22.568 --> 00:23:25.337 align:middle line:84%
If you have a curse and
you didn't do it right,

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:26.405 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to make it worse.

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:29.107 align:middle line:90%
It's a total win-win situation.

00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:30.509 align:middle line:90%
But anybody can do it.

00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:34.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Prior to you coming
on we were in Mercury retrograde

00:23:34.046 --> 00:23:36.715 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
were acting strange

00:23:36.715 --> 00:23:39.384 align:middle line:90%
and weird during that period.

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:40.319 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:41.853 align:middle line:84%
Is that some kind
of energy force?

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:43.088 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: It is.

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:46.625 align:middle line:84%
It looks like Mercury is
going backward instead

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:50.762 align:middle line:84%
of going forward and Mercury
is the planet of communication.

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:54.633 align:middle line:84%
So, anything to do
with communication is.

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:57.502 align:middle line:84%
It's a nightmare during
Mercury retrograde.

00:23:57.502 --> 00:23:59.171 align:middle line:90%
Equipment doesn't work.

00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:03.242 align:middle line:90%
You drop. Computers don't work.

00:24:03.242 --> 00:24:08.614 align:middle line:84%
Very seriously, you don't
ever want to sign final papers

00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:10.682 align:middle line:84%
for a new house on a
Mercury retrograde.

00:24:10.682 --> 00:24:12.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Or anything?

00:24:12.084 --> 00:24:14.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: New car,
you got the lemon if you sign

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:15.687 align:middle line:90%
on a Mercury retrograde.

00:24:15.687 --> 00:24:17.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why is that?

00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: You don't hear

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.226 align:middle line:84%
right during a Mercury
retrograde.

00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:23.595 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And does that mean
the planet is spinning the wrong

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:24.863 align:middle line:90%
way or?

00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:26.064 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: It
appears to be doing that.

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:27.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Appears to be.

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:27.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: It doesn't really.

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:28.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Physically it can't?

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:29.968 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: No, absolutely.

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:31.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I know
enough about astronomy.

00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:32.704 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Exactly.

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:33.872 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: If that happens
we're all in trouble.

00:24:33.872 --> 00:24:35.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
All in trouble, yeah.

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:36.541 align:middle line:90%
No, the planet just took off --

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:37.876 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But it looks
that way you mean?

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:38.744 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Right,

00:24:38.744 --> 00:24:40.379 align:middle line:84%
it appears to be
going backwards.

00:24:40.379 --> 00:24:42.881 align:middle line:84%
And every planet does
it including Earth.

00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:44.783 align:middle line:90%
Earth has a retrograde too.

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:46.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So when we have
a retrograde do we know

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:47.986 align:middle line:90%
when that is?

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:49.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Nobody plays it

00:24:49.254 --> 00:24:52.224 align:middle line:84%
up because it's not a problem
like it is with Mercury.

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:55.527 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is the big, the
big bully in the group.

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:57.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Huh, why is that?

00:24:57.562 --> 00:24:59.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Again,
because that's the planet

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:00.599 align:middle line:90%
that rules communication.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:01.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Interesting.

00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:05.971 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: And you
sign any kind of a contract,

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:08.273 align:middle line:84%
boy you read that two and three
times because you're going

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:11.143 align:middle line:84%
to be reading it wrong and
you're going to sign it.

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:14.713 align:middle line:84%
Mercury retrograde, signing
the final papers on a house is

00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:18.583 align:middle line:84%
so strong that if your
house is for sale forever

00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:21.353 align:middle line:84%
and it's priced right
and you can't sell it,

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:25.590 align:middle line:84%
if you signed your final
papers on a Mercury retrograde,

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.327 align:middle line:84%
you will only sell it
on a Mercury retrograde.

00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:30.696 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Ah, unless you put a
St. Joseph statue in the ground?

00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:31.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Well, that'll help.

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:32.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Will that work?

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:34.666 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: That
helps, yeah but it's not --

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:39.338 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we have
three retrogrades a year.

00:25:39.338 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:84%
They only last three
and half weeks.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.341 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to sell a house.

00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:43.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's not long.

00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:44.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
In three and half weeks.

00:25:44.609 --> 00:25:46.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Especially in
this economic climate.

00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:49.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: That's
right, so it's just a killer.

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:53.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: What about
people who practise Voodoo?

00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:54.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah?

00:25:54.353 --> 00:25:55.354 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I've heard
two different things.

00:25:55.354 --> 00:25:57.989 align:middle line:84%
One is I've heard
it was a religion

00:25:57.989 --> 00:26:02.394 align:middle line:84%
and that North Americans
took it the wrong way.

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
little figurines of people

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and they put five
pins, their name on it.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.501 align:middle line:90%
Here's Mary Ann.

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:12.337 align:middle line:84%
Here's George and it was
nothing to do with cursing

00:26:12.337 --> 00:26:14.039 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:18.877 align:middle line:84%
And then along comes, you know,
Hollywood and everything else

00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and now it's Voodoo dolls,
with a doll of somebody.

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.582 align:middle line:84%
You stick a pin in
and you get it.

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:24.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Sticking
it, right.

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Which is right?

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Both.

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:27.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh, they are.

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
There's good and bad in both.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Okay.

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:30.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Absolutely.

00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:34.059 align:middle line:84%
You can buy a little Voodoo doll
that gives you instructions how

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:37.095 align:middle line:84%
to call somebody to love you
or to get a new boyfriend

00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:39.998 align:middle line:84%
or for money or all kinds
of different things.

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:44.603 align:middle line:84%
Or you can buy a Voodoo doll
with all the little sayings

00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:47.305 align:middle line:84%
that have to go with
it to hurt somebody.

00:26:47.305 --> 00:26:50.075 align:middle line:84%
But there's good and
bad to everything.

00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:51.977 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't it be for that too?

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:53.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I did an
experiment a long time ago

00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:55.113 align:middle line:90%
with my first book.

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:56.848 align:middle line:84%
It was called "Worker in the
Light" but I wanted to talk

00:26:56.848 --> 00:27:03.288 align:middle line:84%
about negativity and I did
an experiment in negativity.

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:09.127 align:middle line:84%
I had to find out if it
worked and I concentrated

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:14.099 align:middle line:84%
for God knows how long
on a negative issue

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:17.869 align:middle line:84%
which I won't go
into and it works.

00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:22.808 align:middle line:84%
It works but it has
a ripple effect.

00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:25.076 align:middle line:90%
There are consequences.

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:27.746 align:middle line:90%
It was a brilliant experiment

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:33.185 align:middle line:84%
that I will never do
again but it's there.

00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:39.724 align:middle line:84%
Why is the consequence
so much more harsh

00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:40.992 align:middle line:90%
than the initial negativity?

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:42.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Because it increases tenfold.

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:43.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: At least.

00:27:43.562 --> 00:27:44.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
And then bites you back.

00:27:44.362 --> 00:27:45.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Big time.

00:27:45.363 --> 00:27:45.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: That's right.

00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:47.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why?

00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:48.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: So
that you learn from that --

00:27:48.633 --> 00:27:49.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why is
somebody doing that to us?

00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:50.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: not
to do it again.

00:27:50.936 --> 00:27:53.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Are there gods
up there doing that?

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:55.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Well, I
believe there's a god watching

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:58.376 align:middle line:84%
out for us one way
or another and maybe

00:27:58.376 --> 00:27:59.845 align:middle line:90%
if you do it enough times

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:03.615 align:middle line:84%
and you get hurt back enough
times you won't do it anymore.

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:04.883 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's learning.

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:06.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Was that a dangerous
experiment on my part?

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:08.353 align:middle line:90%
Was it foolish?

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:90%
You can tell me.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.388 align:middle line:90%
You can tell me.

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:11.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: If
you didn't do it directly

00:28:11.556 --> 00:28:14.826 align:middle line:84%
at somebody to hurt
them, probably not.

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: But I wanted to
see it affect somebody.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:19.931 align:middle line:90%
It was an experiment.

00:28:19.931 --> 00:28:22.701 align:middle line:90%
It was science.

00:28:22.701 --> 00:28:24.035 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:24.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Didn't they call,

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:25.704 align:middle line:90%
you know, the lobotomy?

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:28.139 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't that science too?

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:30.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yeah, I
guess they were.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying I
should not have done that?

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Yeah, I wouldn't have.

00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:35.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: But I had to know.

00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:36.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah.

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:37.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: As they say in
that Clint Eastwood movie,

00:28:37.883 --> 00:28:38.984 align:middle line:90%
right, "Dirty Harry"?

00:28:38.984 --> 00:28:40.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
Had to know, right.

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:41.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I had to know.

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:42.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Feel lucky today?

00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:43.989 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I found out.

00:28:43.989 --> 00:28:49.094 align:middle line:84%
I found out a lot about energy
and negativity and positivity

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:53.632 align:middle line:84%
and karma and attitude
and everything else.

00:28:53.632 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Here's another experiment.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.503 align:middle line:84%
My producer, Tom Danheiser
and I were in Las Vegas

00:28:58.503 --> 00:29:00.305 align:middle line:90%
and we're playing Blackjack.

00:29:00.305 --> 00:29:02.107 align:middle line:84%
It was a different
kind of a game

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:84%
where you could put a dollar
down in addition to your bet

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:10.048 align:middle line:84%
and if you got a Blackjack
and if you had a dollar

00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:13.285 align:middle line:84%
in that little circle you were
allowed to spin this wheel

00:29:13.285 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and you would win anything from
nothing to $1,000 on this reel.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.592 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Okay.

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:22.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's just a huge, big,
like a wheel of fortune thing.

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:24.829 align:middle line:84%
And Tom's over here,
I'm over here

00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:26.197 align:middle line:90%
and there's a guy in the middle.

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:29.634 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough I put a dollar
down on this little circle.

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:32.571 align:middle line:84%
We're playing and I get a
Blackjack and the dealer says,

00:29:32.571 --> 00:29:35.840 align:middle line:84%
well, you're allowed to
spin so we'll spin it

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.711 align:middle line:84%
and wherever it lands
that's how much you get.

00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:42.581 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm looking
at Tom and saying,

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:90%
let's concentrate on the $1,000.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.084 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Oh good.

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:47.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And he
said, you got it,

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:50.555 align:middle line:84%
and the guy in the
middle says, hogwash,

00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:54.326 align:middle line:90%
won't work, waste of time, deal.

00:29:54.326 --> 00:29:56.861 align:middle line:84%
And the dealer says no,
we have to spin the wheel.

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:58.263 align:middle line:90%
The guy won.

00:29:58.263 --> 00:30:02.667 align:middle line:84%
So Tom and I are concentrating
on this $1,000 and this moron

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:06.371 align:middle line:84%
in the middle is
concentrating on negativity.

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Nothing.

00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:09.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: The dealer
spins the wheel.

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:10.742 align:middle line:90%
This is a big wheel.

00:30:10.742 --> 00:30:12.544 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are numbers
all over the place

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's clicking along, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.352 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, it is
getting close to $1,000.

00:30:20.352 --> 00:30:23.388 align:middle line:84%
It's four or five clicks away
and Tom and I are looking

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:84%
at each other going,
we can do this,

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:28.393 align:middle line:84%
and it's going click,
click, click.

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:32.831 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of clicks
away the guy says,

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:34.599 align:middle line:90%
I told you it won't work.

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:36.768 align:middle line:90%
It stopped.

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:41.640 align:middle line:84%
One click from $1,000.
He did it to us.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.674 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yeah, he did.

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:43.608 align:middle line:90%
He did exactly.

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:44.109 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:30:44.109 --> 00:30:45.477 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:30:45.477 --> 00:30:49.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So I have learned
the hard way that negativity,

00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:53.218 align:middle line:84%
attitude controls
everything that we do.

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:54.185 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
You throw it out there

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to come back.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.691 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Absolutely, people
want to track you down

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:00.859 align:middle line:90%
and look at your website.

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Yes?

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.761 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Where do they go?

00:31:02.761 --> 00:31:04.396 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
MaryAnnWinkowski.com

00:31:04.396 --> 00:31:10.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And tell us about
your new book, this cookbook?

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
This cookbook, yeah.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.204 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Here we go.

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:15.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: "100
Recipes from 100 Ghosts"

00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:17.375 align:middle line:84%
and 100 stories
of how I got them.

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:18.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Have the ghosts
given you these recipes?

00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:21.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Every
one of them, every one of them.

00:31:21.146 --> 00:31:22.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Are they recipes

00:31:22.247 --> 00:31:24.249 align:middle line:84%
that would pass the
muster in a restaurant?

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:25.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I think so.

00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:27.886 align:middle line:84%
I do. People have really
had a good time with them.

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:28.586 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Oh, that's fun.

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:29.654 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: And every one

00:31:29.654 --> 00:31:31.456 align:middle line:90%
was tested so they all work.

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:34.359 align:middle line:90%
So it's a cute, little book.

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:35.493 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Hey, I
had fun with you.

00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:36.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
I have had a good time.

00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:39.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And keep
looking at the ghosts

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:41.299 align:middle line:90%
and everything else Mary Ann.

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:42.133 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate you.

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:42.701 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: I will.

00:31:42.701 --> 00:31:44.035 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much.

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Always a pleasure,
good to meet you after being

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.304 align:middle line:84%
on "Coast to Coast" with
me for so many years.

00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:47.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski:
I know, for how long.

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:48.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: For so
many years, my gosh.

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:49.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: I was in studio
once with you.

00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:50.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: One time, one
time, a long time ago.

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:52.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Winkowski: Yeah,
a long time ago, yeah it was.

00:31:52.277 --> 00:31:53.111 align:middle line:90%
This was fun.

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:54.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well, thank you again.

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Winkowski: Thank you.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.781 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You've been watching,
