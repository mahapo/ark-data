GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:10%
Lisa Barnett is with us, the
founder of the Akashic Knowing

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:10%
School of Wisdom,
quantum healer,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.350 align:middle line:10%
and an international bestselling
author of "Your Soul Has

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:10%
a Plan--

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:10%
Awaken to your Life Purpose
Through Your Akashic Records."

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.373 align:middle line:90%
Lisa, welcome to the show.

00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA BARNETT:
Thank you, George.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how have you been?

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.673 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Fabulous.

00:00:37.673 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By the way, when
you were on "Coast to Coast"

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:84%
with me some time
ago and Lisa Garr,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:90%
you did such an amazing job.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
We're still getting
emails about you.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Thank you.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.757 align:middle line:90%
I just love being on your show.

00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, done.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
How did you get involved
in the Akashic Records?

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:10%
>>BARNETT: Well, I
was born very awake,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:10%
and so I started
studying spirituality

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:10%
when I was a teenager.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:10%
And one thing led to another.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.427 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, I started
hearing big, booming voices.

00:01:06.427 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yeah.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
these voices tell you?

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:10%
>>BARNETT: They started giving
me this expansive information

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:10%
like I never had before.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:10%
And it took a long
time to figure out

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:10%
where it was coming
from because, well,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:10%
back then no one knew
about the Akashic Records.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:84%
This was many, many,
many years ago.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I just kept
hit or missing it,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.867 align:middle line:84%
and eventually,
I figured it out.

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we'll
get into that, too.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Your book is called
"Your Soul has a Plan."

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:90%
What's our plan?

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, your
plan is to learn and grow,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and to support humanity, and to
share your gifts and talents.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And so we write a
complicated plan that way.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a soul to you?

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Oh.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, a soul is the infinite
individuated aspect of source

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
that goes on this
phenomenal journey

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and eventually returns home
becoming one with source again.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a good
thing or a bad thing?

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: A soul
is a great thing.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:90%
It's part of source.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.960 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the life.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.377 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it's
handled properly.

00:02:12.377 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] Well--

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the
soul leaves the body,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:90%
what happens to the body?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, the
body turns back-- ashes

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:90%
to ashes, dust to dust.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And we make a contract
with the physical form,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of body suit
to ride around and have

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:90%
these experiences.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty fascinating.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a soul that contracts
with the physical form,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we
are really as humans.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does every
human have a soul?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: I believe so.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.802 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You kind of
hedged yourself there.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:50.602 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS]
Well, you know,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.500 align:middle line:84%
I have not met any humans
that do not have souls.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Although, I
occasionally will hear

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.190 align:middle line:84%
tell that there are
bodies without souls.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's a soul
contract and a soul plan?

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So the
contract is when

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I say I'm going to make
a contract with you

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:90%
to share this wisdom.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The soul plan is
the huge plan that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
includes all of those
contracts and all sorts

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.710 align:middle line:90%
of other information.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do we have souls
in the first place, Lisa?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well,
source decided it

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:84%
wanted to experience all of
the phenomenal universes,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.800 align:middle line:84%
multiverses that it has
been creating always.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
do that, that took

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:84%
kind of individuating an
aspect of source, which we now

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.560 align:middle line:90%
consider our soul.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.970 align:middle line:90%
And the souls are huge.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's thousands of
aspects even of a soul.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're more complicated
than we ever imagined.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's use
you as an example.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
How often do you
tap into your soul?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Do you communicate with it?

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So often, when we
go into the Akashic Records,

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.560 align:middle line:84%
we are looking into aspects
of our soul, who our soul has

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:90%
been, what our soul has done.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.332 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Over the
course of time?

00:04:17.332 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Over
the course of time.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So I do also occasionally
talk to aspects

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
of my soul, which would be my
soul in a different vehicle,

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:90%
maybe on a different planet.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in reincarnation?

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.725 align:middle line:90%
That's what got that library.

00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the same
soul that we possess

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
reincarnate along with us, or
do we get a different soul?

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Nope.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:90%
One soul-- thousands of lives.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why does this one
soul complicate things so much?

00:04:52.065 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] Because
we're really infinite souls.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe we last
forever, right?

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And so just as if this
body lasted forever,

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.090 align:middle line:90%
I'd go to different countries.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:84%
I would probably
get married a lot.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.927 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 10 times, right?

00:05:09.927 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] Right.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:90%
So it's really the experience.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And so we're having a
phenomenal experience

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
by having our soul embody
in different physical forms

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth and
in other realms.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why was the soul
created in the first place

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.590 align:middle line:90%
by source, as you call it?

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:90%
I'll call it God.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: OK, yes.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe that God really
wanted to experience

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:90%
the greatness that it is.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the only
way to do that was

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.440 align:middle line:84%
to have that experience as maybe
a separate piece of itself.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When someone is
good, when someone is bad,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is it the soul
that's doing that?

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:90%
What is creating that?

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So the way
the Record Keepers

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
explain it is that our soul
wants to experience everything.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes it
comes and has fun,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's good and
helpful and supportive.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it comes, and
it wreaks havoc in the world.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A serial
killer, for example--

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:84%
what's wrong with
that person's soul?

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: It is the same
soul that is experiencing

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:90%
a very, very different reality.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So that soul that is so big,
at some point when they write

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that plan they
say, I want to go,

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and I want to have
this experience of what

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:90%
we as humans call evil.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:90%
And I want to--

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:90%
it may have some kind of plan--

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:84%
what it's going to learn,
what it's going to do,

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
or how it's actually
going to wake up humanity.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that we
as souls sometimes come in

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:84%
with the intent to do bad,
to create something good.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When is the
soul contract developed?

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:90%
At birth?

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Before you embody.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So you are saying, oh, I
want to come back to Earth.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
This is a great time
to come to Earth.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we say, what gifts
do I want to bring to Earth?

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Who will support me?

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And so way pre-birth, you
write that whole plan out.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometime in this
program toward the end,

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:84%
you're going to do an
Akashic reading of me,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and we'll see what
that is and how

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.730 align:middle line:90%
it works and stuff like that.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell when you
deal with somebody

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:90%
how many lives they've had?

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, I can ask
the Akashic Record Keepers,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who are
the Record Keepers?

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So you
have a big library.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:90%
I like to imagine it like--

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.800 align:middle line:84%
well, my library is very
beautiful with big stone

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:90%
columns.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Alexandria, right?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS]
Really beautiful and huge

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:84%
because we live so
many thousands of lives

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth and elsewhere.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you have thousands
and thousands of books

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
in your huge library, and you
have a team of librarians.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So not one guide, but you have
a half a dozen or more Akashic

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Record Keepers who
keep that library

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.030 align:middle line:84%
organized for you, who answer
the questions that you have.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So they're really our
beautiful, divine source team

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:84%
helping us to understand what's
written in the Akashic Records.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Can you update your soul
contract any time you want?

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Not
any time you want.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:84%
We can update them, but they
are very kind of dependent

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:84%
on your relationships and what's
happening in that relationship.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a reading
with a client where

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
you cleared some soul contracts
from past lives regarding

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at that.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: The Record Keeper
suggested we rewire your brain,

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.924 align:middle line:90%
left and right hemispheres.

00:08:57.924 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It feels like some of
what they're doing--

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of starting to see it.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:84%
They're removing some of the
program, which is interesting

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:84%
because I often see a program
kind of as an energetic kind

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.020 align:middle line:90%
of box or grid around us.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll definitely
ask if there's those also.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.450 align:middle line:84%
But these are-- look more
embedded in the brain.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:90%
They almost look more like--

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I was going
to say like a spot,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:84%
not that it's a spot on your
brain like in real life,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.422 align:middle line:90%
like it would be a bad thing.

00:09:35.422 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's a programming.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.750 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that's in there that

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:84%
is holding this belief that
you don't deserve money.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a
big one in there

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.880 align:middle line:90%
that money is not good, also.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
the religious part.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.223 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER 1: I've
got to tell you,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:07.023 align:middle line:84%
this is very strange because
my scalp is sort of tingling.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Oh,
interesting, right.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.685 align:middle line:90%
As they're starting to like--

00:10:09.685 --> 00:10:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SPEAKER 1: Literally, I
feel like there's just--

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:90%
it's weird.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I just, you know.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yeah.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So they're really
going also kind of back

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:84%
through this quantum field of
no time space to your origins

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
of human embodiment.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And we just want to ask them
to clear all of those beliefs

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that you're not good
enough, or you're not

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.470 align:middle line:84%
able to receive money
for your talents,

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.790 align:middle line:90%
or your gifts, or that--

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:84%
or that money is bad
or evil or connected

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:90%
in some way to the dark side.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:90%
So kind of let's clear all that.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened two
weeks after this reading?

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: It was actually
fascinating because he called

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:84%
me and he said
that the clients--

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:84%
he had been working
with some clients

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and hoping that they would
purchase what he is offering.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And it had been months and
months, and he was just,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, I'm so stuck.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:90%
No one's hiring me.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is happening.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lose my house.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And the two clients that he
was waiting to hear from,

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
both came in and started
to work with him,

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and really, quite
a few good things

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
started to happen for him by
clearing these old programs

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:90%
and soul contracts.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have vows
of poverty that many of us

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
who have been on
spiritual journeys

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.240 align:middle line:84%
through many lifetimes,
we have these vows again

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and again and again, And
we can actually clear them.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.048 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What possessed
him to want a reading?

00:12:00.048 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: He was kind of
at the end of his rope.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:84%
He really came to me a little
desperate, kind of like, well--

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.073 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This was
it for him, right?

00:12:08.073 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: This is it.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid I'm going
to lose my house,

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know what to do.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not getting any younger,
and so maybe you can help me.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
did, in a big way.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Was he happy?

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Akashic Records--

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.080 align:middle line:90%
explain what they are.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So the
Akashic Records

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.420 align:middle line:84%
are the recording of
your soul's journey

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
through all time
space continuum.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you individuated
from source,

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and your soul went on
a journey, everything

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:84%
is automatically recorded
in this etheric field

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.630 align:middle line:90%
of the Akasha.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who puts
the Records together?

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Are we doing it to ourselves?

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: No.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is we
are having the experience,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's completely
organically recorded.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So I like to say if you imagined
that we had a little video

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:84%
camera already
implanted in our head,

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and everything was recorded
that you did every day--

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.618 align:middle line:84%
everything you saw, your life,
was recorded moment to moment--

00:13:14.618 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just like
"The Truman Show."

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Right.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
uploaded to the cloud

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.720 align:middle line:84%
every night while
you were sleeping,

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and it got uploaded to-- and
then tomorrow you could say,

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:84%
you know, I wonder what
I was doing 10 years ago?

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Or I wonder what is
still affecting my moods?

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Why am I depressed?

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:90%
I wonder where that happened?

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:90%
What happened in my life?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And you could go back and
watch all of those videos.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Although, we have the
Akashic Record Keepers.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:90%
We have these librarians.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:84%
We would ask them the question,
and they would go and look

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:90%
for us for the answers.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.593 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there always a
review, Lisa, when you die--

00:13:55.593 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --of these Records?

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Yes, absolutely
because we make a plan.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to
say, did I succeed?

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:90%
How did I do with my plan?

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they tell you
things like, when you were 10,

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.760 align:middle line:90%
you did this.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And then do you
see a video of it?

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS]
I love that movie.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it's much more as the
soul is going into these higher

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
realms, conversing with
their higher beings that

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
help us to write a plan,
and all of their souls

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
with in this life.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:90%
And we say, how did I do?

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Did I support you the way I
thought I could support you?

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Or did I play a
bad guy well enough

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that you got triggered
and healed that trauma?

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have such big
complicated plans

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.430 align:middle line:84%
that I think we review it
not only with higher guides,

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle line:84%
but the souls that we were
playing on Earth with.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
Galactic Records

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.230 align:middle line:84%
different from the
Akashic Records?

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, mostly
the Akashic Records

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:90%
are about our Earth journey.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course,
the Galactic Records

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:90%
are about the Galactic journeys.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.995 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which sometimes
we do, don't we?

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: We absolutely do.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did we come from?

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well,
after source, we

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.290 align:middle line:84%
have been journeying around
in the multiverse forever.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So we all kind of
have some place

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that we landed and maybe
lasted a very long time in.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.980 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that we are
all really ancient starseeds,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:90%
and we've gotten around.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like in
your particular case,

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:84%
you chose to come to
good old planet Earth.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:90%
I chose to come to planet Earth.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, I
came to planet Earth

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to help re-anchor the
Akashic Records for humanity

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:90%
at this time in history.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if I ask
in my Records, they

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
say I had been an Akashic
Record Keeper in the beginning

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:04.850 align:middle line:90%
of my soul's journey.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we ever
purge the Akashic Records?

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:84%
What if we did something
we didn't like,

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:84%
or we weren't very
proud of in our life?

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:90%
Can we clean them up?

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: We can clean
them up a little bit.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:84%
It is phenomenal
how we can transform

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
some of the energy that
has been completed,

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
which means that we
learned the lesson,

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:90%
and we've shifted that energy.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:84%
We've been the lover,
the forgiveness.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that naturally
kind of cleans itself up.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So we don't go in and just
erase all those lifetimes

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:90%
where we were a bad guy.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.698 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Though we'd like to.

00:16:41.698 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS]
Though we might like to.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people say that
we're living in a Matrix,

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:90%
that we're not real.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, it's a
fascinating conversation,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.950 align:middle line:84%
George, because what I get
in the Records is that we,

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:84%
as these very huge, ancient
souls who come from way higher

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:84%
dimensions-- we're in
the third dimension--

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.609 align:middle line:84%
when we were in
the 12th dimension,

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:84%
we said, hey, let's have
a different experience.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's stop being
one with source,

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and let's come down into
a lower vibrational world.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.190 align:middle line:90%
And so we have created it.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that we,
an aspect of our soul,

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:29.260 align:middle line:90%
does come into a body.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So kind of unlike the
movie "The Matrix,"

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:84%
we're not living somewhere
else having a fake life.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:84%
We really are embodied,
having this kind

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
of dreamlike life without
a level of consciousness

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.413 align:middle line:90%
of who we really are.

00:17:45.413 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say, Lisa,

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:84%
is the most profound
experience you've

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:90%
undertaken doing what you do?

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: There are times
when I am very blessed

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:84%
to do a reading
for someone who is

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:84%
a very ancient, big,
wise soul, and they

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.900 align:middle line:84%
need some help to remember who
they are or why they've come.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they feel stuck, too.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Like, we all get a little
stuck in our lives.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it's profound to
access these Records of people

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
that you see as
Galactic, angelic humans,

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
or ancient, wise
men and women who

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:90%
have had thousands of lives.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it's profound to
see how big and experienced

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:84%
we actually are as
these infinite souls

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:90%
having experiences.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
run into an Akashic

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Record you didn't want to see?

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] That--
a fascinating question.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I would say that everyone
has amazing information

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and/or is really in need
of help and support.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I love to
support my clients

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:84%
by going into their
Records and clearing

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
some of the
emotional trauma that

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:84%
has them stuck in emotional
pain or lack or fear.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And so even those
really challenging

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:84%
lives that some people
have had, we can help them.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:84%
You can help them
through the Akash.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
a starseed, Lisa?

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, a
starseed is someone

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.880 align:middle line:84%
who comes from another
planet, place, dimension,

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:90%
and we are all starseeds.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
really exciting for us

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
to realize we're not
just little earthlings

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:90%
having a life or two.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
We really are big
Galactic beings.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about aliens?

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Are they in the same
ball game as we are?

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:90%
We are them.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So I would say
alien, starseeds--

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:84%
we're really kind
of part and parcel

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
of other worlds, other
dimensions, other places

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.100 align:middle line:90%
and planes.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So I assume they have
their own Akashic Records, too.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Some of that is
written in our Akashic Records

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:84%
because those are the lives
where we have lived in other

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:10.630 align:middle line:90%
worlds as--

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I remember, I always
loved the mermaid lives.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm very mer, I would say.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm from a big water
world, or-- that's

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:90%
what I resonate with now.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So when
I see myself--

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.527 align:middle line:90%
yes-- as the-- as a merperson--

00:20:24.527 --> 00:20:26.485 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did come in
with flippers earlier.

00:20:26.485 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS]
I almost wish

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I did because I love
the water so much.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:90%
I really--

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Flopping your way in.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Right.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, so it's
lovely to remember

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.398 align:middle line:90%
these different kind of lives.

00:20:39.398 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I could have done
the interview with you

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:90%
in an aquarium for all I know.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] Right.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Where's my mer-outfit
when I need one?

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
were a little kid,

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:90%
did you have these abilities?

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.812 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would guess you did.

00:20:52.812 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Very, very young I realized that
I was trapped back in a body,

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and that was my reaction and my
realization, like, holy moly.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm trapped.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Here, I've got hands
again, and I could

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.430 align:middle line:90%
remember not being in a body.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.760 align:middle line:90%
And so I was not really happy.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I used to tell my mom
I wanted to go back.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I want to go home.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Where's home?

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Takes me back.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the Akashic
Records have just my life

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:90%
that I'm living now?

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Or does it have every
reincarnated life

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:90%
mixed in together?

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So every life
is mixed in that library

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:84%
that we would call the
Akashic Record of George.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if we access
it-- if you access it,

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:90%
you can see past lives, too?

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.105 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:43.105 --> 00:21:44.272 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:21:44.272 --> 00:21:47.152 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So that's part of
what I usually would look at.

00:21:47.152 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So we can look at
some past lives--

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.735 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could I have been
a good guy or a bad guy?

00:21:50.735 --> 00:21:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: We can
ask in your Records.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:54.128 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
people handle that,

00:21:54.128 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:84%
if you told them that
they did something

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:90%
deplorable in another life?

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, I try
and say it really nicely.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tactfully?

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Is there a tactful way to
say you were a murderer?

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] I try.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:84%
People don't always
think I'm totally tactful

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:90%
no matter how hard I try.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
But really, sometimes
it's when we

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
think things like,
why would I have

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.690 align:middle line:90%
such a painful, traumatic life?

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons is that we

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
are learning another
aspect of who we

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:90%
have been in another lifetime.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.306 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
amnesia phenomenon?

00:22:33.306 --> 00:22:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So we-- we write
this big, complicated plan.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:90%
We have soul contracts.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:90%
We have gifts and talents.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:90%
We come in a body--

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:90%
total amnesia.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:90%
And so it--

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
reason for that.

00:22:45.955 --> 00:22:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: There is
really a reason for that.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
It is because we want to
play this game full on.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:90%
We want to really know.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.785 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think it's also a
protection mechanism, isn't it?

00:22:56.785 --> 00:22:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Well, yes.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we knew
every past life

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.417 align:middle line:90%
we would be totally confused.

00:23:01.417 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: We-- yes.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:84%
We could not walk
around with past lives

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:90%
popping into our head.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:06.450 align:middle line:90%
In and out.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Did I know that person?

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:90%
I forgot?

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] Right.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:90%
I have some of that experience--

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That happens to you.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: --in my life.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.498 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Yeah, it
can be confusing.

00:23:16.498 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of
the benefits of knowing

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:90%
some of our past lives?

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Well--

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How could it help me?

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So if you imagine
that in other lifetimes

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:84%
you had gifts and talents,
say, of being a speaker,

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
of being a wisdom
keeper, and you

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.810 align:middle line:84%
wanted to bring those
gifts from those lifetimes

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.710 align:middle line:84%
into this life, that's part of
the soul plan you're writing.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe I was Guglielmo
Marconi and invented the radio.

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:44.355 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:23:44.355 --> 00:23:47.842 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS]
Who knows, right?

00:23:47.842 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's possible.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: It is
absolutely possible.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you do
readings on people,

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:56.580 align:middle line:90%
are you very blunt with them?

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Do you hold back?

00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: I do.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:23:59.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do?

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.090 align:middle line:90%
You hold back, or you--

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.257 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: In all honesty,
this is the way it works.

00:24:03.257 --> 00:24:08.140 align:middle line:84%
So when I get a download from
the Record Keepers I ask them,

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.600 align:middle line:84%
is that appropriate
to say right now?

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.030 align:middle line:10%
And I tell them whatever
the Record Keepers

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.540 align:middle line:10%
tell me to tell them.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:90%
And so I try and say it nicely.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I will sometimes say
to the Record Keepers,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:84%
can you give me a better
way to say that that's not

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.950 align:middle line:90%
so harsh or so shocking?

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:90%
And so I try to be sensitive.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
upset them or hurt them.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:84%
But what I find is that
between the unconditional love

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and energy of the Akashic
field and the Record Keepers,

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and the love that
really comes through,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and the wisdom that comes
with that information,

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.420 align:middle line:90%
they understand it.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.600 align:middle line:84%
They really can
understand why they

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
had that painful, challenging
thing happen to them,

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.430 align:middle line:84%
or why they're
struggling in this life.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it opens their eyes and
helps them to make new choices

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and move forward
with greater ease.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do our past lives,
Lisa, affect our current life?

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So,
again, we say, oh, I

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.550 align:middle line:84%
had a great relationship with
that person in a past life.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll marry them again.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So we write a
contract with them.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.600 align:middle line:90%
We say--

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That happens.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: That's part
of your soul contracts

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:90%
and your soul's plan.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:84%
We write all of that
into our soul plan.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:90%
We write in soul family members.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, I would like to have
as my mother someone who's

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.955 align:middle line:90%
part of my soul family.

00:25:40.955 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, you found some connections
of a multiple past lives

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.280 align:middle line:84%
with a client related to
the work she does today.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: But what
I'm hearing more

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:84%
is-- and this is
kind of interesting,

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:55.440 align:middle line:90%
because it's very old.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.830 align:middle line:84%
It's very connected
to the flooding

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and to Atlantis and the
great Atlantean flood.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm hearing
is there's a whole part

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.910 align:middle line:90%
of that, that you were there.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:84%
You were in Atlantis
during the flood.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually connected
to some of your purpose,

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.320 align:middle line:90%
your big purpose, which is--

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.750 align:middle line:90%
sometimes shows up like a job.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:90%
And often, it doesn't.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But that purpose is about
helping to stop that

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:90%
from happening again--

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:39.140 align:middle line:84%
helping to plan so that we don't
wipe out coasts and lose half

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:84%
of our country, like
the whole South,

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:84%
or like New Orleans and
these kind of places.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I see the floodwaters rising,
and they're showing it to me

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:84%
more like in Atlantis than here,
but they're really equating it

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:02.750 align:middle line:84%
to what has happened, what is
happening, what a lot of people

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.390 align:middle line:90%
are not talking about.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.130 align:middle line:84%
That makes a lot of sense
because specifically what I do

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:90%
is flood resilience planning.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And I work with helping
communities, cities,

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.350 align:middle line:84%
counties adapt to
sea level rise,

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:21.870 align:middle line:84%
as well as storm water and
precipitation flooding.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.350 align:middle line:90%
So it makes a lot of sense.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Right.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Like, wow.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know so
much more about this.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm just seeing
this water rising.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying this
is connected to Atlantis

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:90%
and the great floods.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And you, as a
soul, saying, we're

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:84%
not going to let
that happen again.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that pretty
indicative of readings

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.120 align:middle line:90%
for people--

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.230 align:middle line:90%
what you just did?

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:84%
When we start to look at why
souls have come and embodied

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:84%
now, and part of what
their purpose is--

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and I often say, our
purpose is not one thing.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And this was kind
of amazing to me

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.030 align:middle line:84%
because really,
the Record Keepers

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
were talking about Atlantis
and the great floods.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And here, she does
flood control as a job,

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.480 align:middle line:84%
which I've never met anybody
who does that before.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:90%
So that was very wild.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
indicative of who we

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:22.990 align:middle line:84%
are as people, and the things we
love to do, and what draws us.

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
believed in reincarnation

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.210 align:middle line:84%
as a process of getting
better and better and better

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:32.200 align:middle line:84%
in lives and perfection,
that we don't step backwards,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:84%
but we're constantly going
forwards, getting more

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:90%
to that heavenly perfection.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Do you agree with that?

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: I absolutely do.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.060 align:middle line:84%
The Record Keepers
kind of show it to me,

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:84%
almost like if you were
starting a pearl necklace.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And your first life,
where you really

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.640 align:middle line:84%
actualized whatever
that gift was

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.010 align:middle line:84%
is the first pearl
on the necklace.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a second
and third and fifth and 10th.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
have a lovely pearl

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.922 align:middle line:90%
necklace, and that is your--

00:29:03.922 --> 00:29:07.510 align:middle line:84%
one of your great gifts, one
of those gifts you've honed.

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And you come back
again and again

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.810 align:middle line:90%
to share it with humanity.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had heard,
Lisa, that all the people

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.760 align:middle line:84%
we have associated
with in our life,

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:84%
we have done that
before in past lives.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere along the
line, I interviewed you,

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.540 align:middle line:84%
or you interviewed me,
something like that.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:90%
You agree with that?

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: I really do.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we run,
again, in circles.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's thousands
of us in the circle,

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:84%
but we see each other
again and again.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that
in a past life

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:47.020 align:middle line:84%
you were a neighbor, or
somebody I worked with, or could

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:90%
have been very different.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we were writing
books together

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.620 align:middle line:84%
hundreds and hundreds
of years ago.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there ever
a gap in your life,

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:58.070 align:middle line:90%
in your reincarnated lives?

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And by that I mean is it
sequential, or does it break,

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.030 align:middle line:84%
and you come back 50
years later or something?

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yeah.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So we can come back quickly,
or I think sometimes we

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.290 align:middle line:90%
take a really long break.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I think the way I
hear it is, is that often,

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:84%
it's 50 or 100 of
our human years,

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:84%
which is very different
from other energy

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have time and space.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.740 align:middle line:90%
So for us, it might be 50 years.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:90%
It might be 100.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.200 align:middle line:90%
It might even be 500.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I've seen souls that
really take a long break.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:84%
They say, you know, I'm kind of
done with the energy on Earth

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:35.430 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:36.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going back for a while.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:40.128 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What fascinates you
about the Akashic Records?

00:30:40.128 --> 00:30:41.545 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
excitable about it.

00:30:41.545 --> 00:30:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I find it so fascinating
because it really

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:84%
explains a lot of about who
we are now and why we came.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And I find it also
phenomenal when

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.680 align:middle line:84%
we can look at our
other lifetimes

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and realize who we've
been and what we've done.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Because so often
humans feel like,

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.250 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm just this little person.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:84%
How could I write a book,
or be on George's show?

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.700 align:middle line:84%
But when we look
at other lifetimes,

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and we realize that we have
been authors, and healers,

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and inventors, and leaders, and
teachers all around the world,

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.220 align:middle line:90%
then we go, oh, well, OK.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.682 align:middle line:90%
Why not, then?

00:31:29.682 --> 00:31:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know
we're on the right path

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.040 align:middle line:90%
of righteousness?

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: When our life
flows with ease and grace,

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I believe we are always
on the right path.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we ever divert
and take the road not taken?

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: We love to do that.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of
our favorite things

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.960 align:middle line:90%
because we have free will.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.620 align:middle line:84%
So we wrote that
into the whole plan.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.390 align:middle line:90%
So we get to make a choice.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:32:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we think that
might be easy, but boring.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.170 align:middle line:84%
That might be
scary and exciting.

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll try that.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And it may or may
not work out so well.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:84%
But what the Record
Keepers always say

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:13.905 align:middle line:84%
is we learn and grow
from those experiences.

00:32:13.905 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's one of
the greatest poems

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:19.400 align:middle line:84%
that Robert Frost ever wrote, by
the way, "The Road not Taken."

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Because it ends with it made
all the difference in the world

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.650 align:middle line:90%
by taking the other path.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's like life, isn't it?

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes, absolutely.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we come
really embodying again

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and again is to learn
and grow, to have

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:90%
these phenomenal experiences.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:84%
How many worlds can you have the
experiences that we have here?

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.490 align:middle line:90%
And so we're enjoying it.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:84%
We're loving other
people, sunsets, sunrises,

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:84%
all of the creation
and creativity

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.620 align:middle line:90%
that we have as souls embodied.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that when
we're not embodied,

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.260 align:middle line:90%
and so we love it.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say that
that enthusiasm always

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.400 align:middle line:84%
kind of rubs off on me
when I'm in the Records.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we talking
to the Akashic Records

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.690 align:middle line:90%
as if it communicates with us?

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.783 align:middle line:90%
Does it work that way?

00:33:09.783 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: We can ask
them specific questions,

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and they will give
us specific answers.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I do a
reading for a client

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I always tell them,
come in with questions

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.070 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
meet you where you are,

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:90%
with what you're interested in.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's do that reading
you talked about on me.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: OK.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do we do that?

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: OK.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do I do?

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So [LAUGHS] you
don't have to do anything.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the easy part, right?

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Finally, I don't
have to do anything.

00:33:39.965 --> 00:33:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] I know.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:41.710 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So you just get to
be George, and I

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.720 align:middle line:84%
am going to call in-- we
ask the Akashic Record

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Keepers to encircle us in
the beautiful Akashic energy

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.230 align:middle line:84%
of light and love, and we
ask them to connect us up

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:59.630 align:middle line:90%
into your Akashic Record.

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:90%


00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I just feel that
energy swirling around.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you're very sensitive.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But to me right now,
it's feeling kind of

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:18.699 align:middle line:84%
like a cool breeze, and there's
so much love coming in for you.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
because they immediately

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:27.960 align:middle line:84%
are saying that you are very,
very Pleiadian, if you ever

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.050 align:middle line:84%
believe and think about
starseeds or other planets

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:32.639 align:middle line:90%
and worlds you're from.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've never
thought of that.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.950 align:middle line:84%
I've thought of it in terms
of other people, but not me.

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yeah.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:42.150 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Well, you
are very Pleiadian.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And the fascinating
thing with the Pleiadians

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:84%
is that part of their whole
purpose in embodying--

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.250 align:middle line:84%
so the way the Record
Keepers explain

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:84%
it is that your soul
has thousands of lives,

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and many of them took
place in the Pleiades.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Another star system.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: In another-- yes.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:04.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: And so you
have that information

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.330 align:middle line:90%
stored in your Akash.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that is part of
your soul, your wisdom,

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.280 align:middle line:90%
and your gifts.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And that energy says, I want
to come back and embody now,

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and I want to help
humanity awaken.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any idea why
I left the Pleiadians

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.480 align:middle line:90%
to come to planet Earth?

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Because you have a
gift to help humanity awaken,

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and you've done it in
many other lifetimes.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.230 align:middle line:84%
But just think about
it, George, right?

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Here you are sharing all of
this awakening information

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.265 align:middle line:90%
with humanity through--

00:35:43.265 --> 00:35:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With
millions of people.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: With
millions and millions

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:84%
through this and
"Coast to Coast."

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's phenomenal
that you, as one soul,

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:84%
have done so much
to awaken humanity.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.575 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you see any
downside in my Akashic Records

00:36:03.575 --> 00:36:04.375 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning?

00:36:04.375 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] You have
some other more mundane lives.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:14.710 align:middle line:84%
But I actually see you as
a monk or priest writing--

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.230 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.870 align:middle line:90%
writing books.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:20.670 align:middle line:90%
If you can--

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Transcribing books?

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yeah.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Transcribing books.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:middle line:84%
You know how they wrote
the beautiful, with all

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.910 align:middle line:90%
the gorgeous calligraphy.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And you would copy one
book because it was all

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.680 align:middle line:90%
done by hand.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that life, which is
many hundreds of years ago,

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.410 align:middle line:84%
that one-- well, that
one's around 1100

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:84%
AD is what I'm hearing, you
were very devoted to God,

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:51.050 align:middle line:84%
to the divine, to source, and
again, awakening humanity.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And so you were a monk, and
you were transcribing bibles,

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:00.850 align:middle line:84%
really, and helping people
to get that information out

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:01.720 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe I
wrote the Bible.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, [LAUGHS] I
think that was a group effort,

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.455 align:middle line:84%
but you may have
been there also.

00:37:10.455 --> 00:37:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or a couple
chapters at least.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Right, right.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we wrote,
edited, rewrote, I

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.060 align:middle line:84%
am hearing actually that
you were at one point

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.430 align:middle line:90%
part of a collective of--

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:26.600 align:middle line:84%
they're saying 12--
humans at that point, who

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.930 align:middle line:84%
came together and decided
what was appropriate to be

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.390 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible and what was not.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
just said they are saying.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Who's talking to you?

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: The Record Keepers.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Your Record Keeper.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So you have a library, and you
have Akashic Record Keepers

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:43.790 align:middle line:90%
who are your librarian.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
happy with my lives?

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: They are very
happy with your lives, George.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't have
any complaints, no problems?

00:37:51.455 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Look
what you've done.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.610 align:middle line:84%
You have-- they're
saying, you have

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:59.510 align:middle line:90%
surpassed your soul purpose.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.330 align:middle line:84%
You have done more
than your soul ever

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:04.370 align:middle line:90%
expected you would do.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I exceeded my levels.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:84%
You totally, totally exceeded
all expectations of you,

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.700 align:middle line:84%
your soul, when you
wrote that plan.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what will
my next life be like?

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Wow.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
how do I top this?

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: They're saying that
it will actually be even better

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:31.320 align:middle line:84%
because it will be one
where we have learned--

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.100 align:middle line:84%
it's a process learn
to come into bodies,

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and for our bodies to live a
long and healthy life again.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When do you
stop reincarnating?

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Most of us stop
reincarnating when we have

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.350 align:middle line:90%
completed all of our plans.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.040 align:middle line:84%
We've really worked through
all of our contracts.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.800 align:middle line:84%
We've gotten-- we've finished
all the karmic patterns.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.930 align:middle line:84%
We've learned everything
we've come to learn.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we either
go back and start

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.790 align:middle line:90%
incarnating on other worlds.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Or we eventually return
to source and say,

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm good with just
being one again.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Humanity has good
people, and it has bad people.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever see that
changing, where the good

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:90%
starts to win out all the time?

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes, I actually do.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the beautiful pieces

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.170 align:middle line:84%
that I see in the
Akashic Records.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So because it's complicated,
and we have free will,

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:33.450 align:middle line:84%
we, as a collective group of
humanity, can jump timelines,

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we've been
doing in the last 30, 40 years,

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:42.930 align:middle line:84%
is we were going from a
possibility of creating World

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.590 align:middle line:84%
War III and really
destroying our planet.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Destroying ourselves.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.228 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: And so many
lightworkers came and--

00:39:49.228 --> 00:39:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that off the table?

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.075 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: That's off the table.

00:39:52.075 --> 00:39:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You promise?

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are so
many people imbalanced?

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, because,
again, thousands of years ago

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:07.050 align:middle line:84%
we lived in a world that it
was very divine feminine.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.620 align:middle line:84%
The divine mother
was really honored.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:16.860 align:middle line:84%
There was great love and a kind
of grace and energy of balance.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, energetically,
things start to change,

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and the divine masculine
became more powerful,

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and it turned more
into human masculinity.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So war, overcoming,
gaining, winning wars,

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.340 align:middle line:84%
getting more land, all of
that won out in our world.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And so now, it's time
to bring balance back.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many projects
are you working on these days?

00:40:45.825 --> 00:40:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] A lot.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Many books, always.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Always love to bring out
more books into the world,

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and teaching classes because
the Record Keepers said to me,

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:03.120 align:middle line:84%
it's time for humanity
to be able to access

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.160 align:middle line:84%
their own personal
Akashic Records.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm teaching
more classes.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And people are
accessing their Records?

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yeah.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
happy with that?

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: It's-- yes.

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:13.740 align:middle line:90%
It's so lovely.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do people find you?

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:19.290 align:middle line:10%
>>BARNETT: People find me on my
website at akashicknowing.com.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.320 align:middle line:10%
And you can always find
my online workshops,

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:10%
and my three books
are on Amazon.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:29.520 align:middle line:90%
So I am pretty available.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Still doing some
Akashic readings

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and healing sessions
for clients.

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And classes starting
all the time.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.832 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
bullish on humanity.

00:41:41.832 --> 00:41:44.165 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Yes, I think that
we're going to pull it out.

00:41:44.165 --> 00:41:45.733 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I am.

00:41:45.733 --> 00:41:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's encouraging.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: It is encouraging.

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Working in the Akashic
Records is very encouraging.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And so-- because these
beautiful, divine beings

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.380 align:middle line:84%
of light are helping
us and supporting us.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.120 align:middle line:90%
And we are actually awakening.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So more people are
accessing the Records.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.790 align:middle line:10%
More people are waking up to the
fact that we are divine souls,

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.490 align:middle line:10%
and we do have a
mission, and that mission

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:13.520 align:middle line:10%
is love, and really awakening.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And so as more and
more people start

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:84%
to remember and
start to be the love,

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.210 align:middle line:84%
then we will shift the
trajectory of humanity,

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and we will move
from war to peace

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.880 align:middle line:90%
to enlightenment eventually.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.467 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hopefully
sooner than later.

00:42:33.467 --> 00:42:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: I'm with you, George.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.570 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lisa, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:37.695 --> 00:42:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Thank you so much.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:39.650 align:middle line:90%
It's been a joy.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:41.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You now, when our
staff from "Beyond Belief"

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:10%
told me that she was going
to give me an Akashic Record

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.200 align:middle line:10%
reading, I thought
for one moment,

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.520 align:middle line:10%
how do I get into those
Records and change some things?

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, after listening
to Lisa, I realize

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to change anything.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.242 align:middle line:90%
I am who I am, and so are you.

00:42:57.242 --> 00:42:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief."

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:02.050 align:middle line:90%
