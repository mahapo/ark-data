>>JIMMY CHURCH: Hey, everyone.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jimmy Church.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.020 align:middle line:10%
You may know me from Into
the Vortex here on Gaia,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:10%
and today I'm honored
to be stepping

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:10%
in for George Noory for this
episode of Beyond Belief.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, unless you've been
living under a rock in the UFO

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:84%
community, you've
definitely heard about this.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It's viral, and it's
sparking debate.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Today, you're going to see
it up close and personal.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, I'm talking
about the Buga sphere.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.900 align:middle line:84%
We have the one and only
Jaime Maussan with us,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and he's bringing the
Buga sphere right here

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:90%
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jaime.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JAIME MAUSSAN: Hello, Jimmy.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: I am fantastic.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:90%
And look at that.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:84%
The Buga sphere is sitting
there right with you.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
We have another guest
on the show today.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:10%
What we have found
inside this sphere

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:10%
is out of the mind, my friend.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:90%
It's really high technology.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And important thing,
Jimmy, is this object

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
for the first time is in
the hands of civilians,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:84%
because normally,
this kind of things

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:84%
end up in the hands of the
governments, of the military.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And this time, it's
with us, and now we

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:90%
have the chance to investigate.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: The sphere itself was
first seen flying over Buga back

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:90%
on March 2nd in 2025 this year.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take a
look at that footage.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And Jaime, give
us the background

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and tell me what
we're looking at.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, of course,
there were two videos.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:10%
The first one was recorded
by Maria, a girl, 24,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:10%
that is married
to a military man,

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:10%
and she lives in Alto
Bonito, the place where

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:10%
this sphere was observed.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
In the video, you can see how
the sphere goes up and down.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It seems like if the sphere
wanted to land, was falling,

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
but finally, the sphere
left and then went

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:90%
to the other side of the hill.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And in that side
was Mr. José, and he

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
wants to keep the name,
until now, private.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking for treasures
with an electromagnetic machine.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And then he says that the sphere
came very close to his head,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:84%
that if the sphere had hit
his head, he would be dead.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Then he saw it leaving
and then came back.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they decided,
because there were two people,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.380 align:middle line:84%
they decided to
record the sphere,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and they recorded
for eight minutes

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:90%
very long time for a fake video.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:90%
This had to be real.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we
investigated both videos,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Maria's video and José's video,
and both of them are real.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any AI,
any kind of fakery there.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And then we know that the sphere
was really flying or levitating,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and finally came down.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:10%
And at that moment,
José ran for the sphere,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.190 align:middle line:10%
took it with both
hands, and then he

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:10%
realized that it was not heavy.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:10%
And then he took it with
one hand, and he left.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
He put the sphere on
the ground, and now we

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
know that all that area got
dry, is now very, very dead.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.690 align:middle line:90%
There is no vegetation.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:90%
He left the sphere for an hour.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And in that place, something
happened, something wrong

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:90%
or something dangerous.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
But something inside the
sphere made the field dry.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we know.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that was important,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that the sphere weighted
two kilos at the beginning,

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and through the days, the
sphere went up to six kilos,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:84%
to nine kilos, and
now, weighs 10 kilos.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And probably, it's
because the sphere

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
has been losing the energy that
helped the sphere to levitate.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is why it's heavier
than when it came down to earth.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:84%
The reason it came
down to earth is

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
because it hit a cable,
high voltage cable.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can see a
little hole in the back

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.230 align:middle line:84%
where the sphere
touched the cable

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:90%
and received a big discharge.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And probably because of
that, it didn't function well

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:90%
until it came down.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
That's more or less the long
story short of this sphere,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:84%
why, for the first time, it's
in the hands of civilians.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So, Jaime, if
I'm understanding you,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
the sphere was flying, and
then hit the power lines,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:90%
and then fell.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, 10,000
volts, we think.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So did the power
cables, the high power tension

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.137 align:middle line:84%
lines, did that interfere
with its flight?

00:05:44.137 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: That's what we think.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
reason we understand

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:84%
that the sphere really
stopped flying or levitating.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Something happened inside
and didn't work well.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, it
was losing, probably,

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:84%
energy until it came down
just in front of the witness--

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that's something very
important-- less than, what,

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:90%
50 yards away.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And then he was able to
run and catch the sphere.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And he took it home, and he
got sick for a couple of days

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
because the sphere had this
energy, probably isotopes

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
because it didn't have any--

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:84%
how can I say-- like an
atomic bomb or something.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is why he
was able to keep it.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, he
had to go to the doctor

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:90%
because he got very sick.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: How did
you get the sphere?

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:90%
It was found in Colombia.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:90%
But how did you get it?

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And then how did you
get it out of Colombia?

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
question is, why

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
didn't the Colombian
government stop you?

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Because they
didn't know this happened.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.990 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know this sphere
came down for the first thing,

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
know it was probably

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial or something.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.260 align:middle line:90%
The thing is this.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.810 align:middle line:84%
After this man, José,
found the sphere,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
he delivered it to David
Velez el Potro, a singer

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and a businessman
of Cali, Colombia.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:84%
He was the owner of
this company that

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
produces electromagnetic
equipment

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
to look for treasure,
coins, and things like that.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, Mr.
José gave the sphere to David

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.250 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't know
what to do with it,

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't want it
because he was getting

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.100 align:middle line:90%
sick by having the sphere.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Then David sent people with
electric special suits.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Hazmat?

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, these suits to
protect yourself from any--

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Radiation?

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Radiation.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.710 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
find any radiation.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:10%
They kept the sphere in a
special place for 40 days

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.230 align:middle line:10%
until they realized that
it was not dangerous.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:10%
Then they started to
investigate the sphere.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:10%
And around the 26th of March,
they opened the investigation.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:90%
They published the videos.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.309 align:middle line:84%
They were able to get the second
video from Maria and the video

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
from José, and they
published them in YouTube,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and then people
got really excited.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:90%
And they wanted--

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Germany, the Germany company--

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:90%
that's the name of it--

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:90%
to investigate the sphere.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.250 align:middle line:84%
But Germany didn't know
what to do with it.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Then they wanted to
keep it in a museum,

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:84%
but people were not
happy about that.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And all the people in Buga and
Cali asked for something else.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I got
in touch with them

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and I told them, if
you want to tell them

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
that you gave me the
sphere, and that way, they

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:middle line:90%
won't bother you anymore.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:90%
And they did that.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly, the
people responded so well.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Everybody told Germany
and David Velez,

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's a very good idea.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It's very good you
gave it to Jaime.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:84%
It's in very good
hands, and so on.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And then the company
and David decided

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
that the best thing to do was to
give me the sphere because they

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:90%
felt in danger.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:84%
They felt that with time,
people would get very dangerous

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:45.510 align:middle line:84%
in Colombia and probably
would do something else

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:90%
to get the sphere from them.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And they thought that
the best thing to do

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.530 align:middle line:84%
was to give me the sphere and
take it out of Colombia, out

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:90%
of their hands.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they did.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:90%
How did I take it out?

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.310 align:middle line:90%
In a small suitcase.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I put it there and I
took it through customs.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:90%
They saw it, and what is this?

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And I say, oh, it's
a handcrafted sphere.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell them that
this sphere was flying

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:90%
and was recorded.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Then they said, oh, you
cannot take it into the plane.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Probably, you can
take it down the plane

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
in the cabin in the back,
in the storage place.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid that I was going
to lose it, but I didn't.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And when I arrived in Mexico,
I took it through customs

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:90%
like nothing.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what is that?

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I said, a sphere.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:90%
It's an artesanía.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, OK,
go ahead, and that's it,

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:90%
and I have it.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the story.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:84%
It's very simple the
way I did it through,

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't make--

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I didn't put too much
grandiosity, or I didn't do it.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I made it as simple as
possible, and that's

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:84%
the way I was able to get it
through costumes into Mexico.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.677 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: So no drama.

00:11:14.677 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: You think
they know what is this?

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.040 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what is this.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:84%
They looked at it and
I said it's artesanía.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.200 align:middle line:90%
It's artesanía.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't have anything inside.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.630 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find
drugs inside, and they

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:90%
look for drugs and guns.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:90%
There is not a gun inside.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:90%
There is no drugs inside.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
There is no reason.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Why would they stop me?

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:84%
If I say, oh, this is something
that was flying in the sky,

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't stop me.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
There is no laws to stop
you from doing that.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What kind of
testing has been done?

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: All kinds of testing.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:90%
We took it to the--

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
first thing, we make X-rays,
and we found that the sphere,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have
any-- how you say?

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:90%
A joint.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:84%
It's two hemispheres,
but it's like this.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how they
did it because there

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:84%
is nothing that is joining
both parts at the same time.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:84%
All the experts who have seen
that this is unknown technology.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
We saw that the sphere
was made of aluminum

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.970 align:middle line:90%
and also a lot of silicium.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.030 align:middle line:84%
After we made the
X-rays where we

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:84%
found that the sphere
had something inside,

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.460 align:middle line:90%
we took it to make tomographies.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:84%
You have the images, and you
can see an object inside,

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
a dispositive, we call
it, that's something

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that we think that
moves there and creates

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:90%
the electromagnetic energy.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this
can somehow fly,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
because it annihilates
the gravity,

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and that's how it flies.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Then we took it to the
University in Mexico,

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
and they found the
most important thing

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:90%
is that there are many holes.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.390 align:middle line:84%
All these holes
have fiber optics,

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of sizes, some of
them as thin, like a hair, some

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:90%
of them thicker.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And we now know they are used
to see everything around us.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:90%
This is a big sensor.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:90%
They can see everything.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:84%
They can see through
ultraviolet, probably infrared.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:90%
They can see side view.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.760 align:middle line:90%
They can see your cells.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:90%
They can see everything.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And besides that, they
have all these copper dots.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.270 align:middle line:10%
And we think that
this is the antenna,

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:10%
and they are able to
broadcast from the fiber

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.790 align:middle line:10%
optics to the antenna, and
from there to somewhere else.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And there is also
these moons here.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And the inside of these
moons is a different kind

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:90%
of aluminum than here.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a different alloy.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Also, we found that
this looks like a chip.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find
what is made of.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Probably, it's an
alloy that is unknown.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't know for
sure what it is.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:84%
There are these letters,
this message here.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it is.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:90%
We are trying to find out.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But something very
interesting is

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.350 align:middle line:90%
that the sphere is very rustic.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It was made with a
very old technique

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to make the aluminum,
to make the sphere.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a technique that
was used 5,000 years ago.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Arena húmeda, like a wet sand.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a very old way to do it.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:90%
The question is this.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Why is this sphere so
advanced in technology,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time,
so rustic, so simple?

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing we
found is that probably it

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:84%
was made with the
cleanest way to do it,

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
something we don't
use it anymore,

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.540 align:middle line:84%
but it's the cleanest way to
produce a sphere like this.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Probably these civilizations
that are very advanced

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:84%
are using old technologies
because these technologies don't

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:84%
hurt the Earth or
the life on Earth.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:40.620 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the reason they
use this technology of wet sand.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:84%
This morning, we were
able to set an agreement

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:84%
with the University of Mexico
to continue the investigation.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:90%
There is so much more to find.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Next Friday, in
Gaia, we'll be here,

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and we are going to have
a press conference where

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:84%
we are going to present all
the scientists, the report

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.630 align:middle line:90%
from the National University.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And very important
people from the Congress

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.670 align:middle line:84%
of the United States are
coming to this event.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Besides, very
important investigators

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
of the UFO field,
and also our friend

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Danny Sheehan, who
has been working

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.330 align:middle line:84%
with the Congress
in the last months

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to make possible these
audiences that have

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:90%
been presented to the public.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Jaime, describe for me
what the X-rays have revealed.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
We've got 16 spheres
on the inside.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk
about fiber optics,

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
as well, are these
fiber optics verified?

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Are they terrestrial?

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that
comes from somewhere else?

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:84%
What are the 16
spheres used for?

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Well, the
16 spheres are these.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:10.090 align:middle line:84%
These go inside the sphere,
not very much, but at least,

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:90%
this sphere is not even an inch.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:90%
It's two centimeters thick.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.380 align:middle line:84%
The exterior of the
sphere is two centimeters.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:10%
These dots, which are
copper, go inside the sphere,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:10%
but there are no wires inside.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.550 align:middle line:10%
You don't see them.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:84%
We found the wires
for the fiber optics,

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:90%
but no wires inside the sphere.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
All the wires are
inside the aluminum,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.530 align:middle line:90%
and they are around this area.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And this, we think,
is the antenna.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:84%
With this, they are able
to broadcast, send orders,

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:90%
or receive orders.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:90%
There are 16.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Two of them, we think that this
and this, the longest, we think

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:84%
are used to direct the sphere
to have the real position

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:90%
of the sphere.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are seven in one
side, seven in the other.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And we think this
is our hypothesis.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of investigation
needs to be done.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.780 align:middle line:90%
We can be wrong.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I am not saying
that this is a fact.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, we are going

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
to try to use this to find
the frequencies of this sphere

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
to send the message to wherever,
whoever is the owner of this,

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
to see if we can connect,
we can have communication.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is absolutely
fantastic if we can do that.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be something else.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Another thing we
want to do is, we

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.580 align:middle line:84%
want to make we're going to
try to put energy inside.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And probably with energy inside,
and we'll make it rotate,

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:84%
the sphere can make them produce
the electromagnetic fields,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and with that
electromagnetic fields,

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:84%
will be able to float again,
and probably even fly away.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Or I don't know.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what we can do.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, we
want to find out

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
what is this technology
for the well of the people.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
We think this is
clean technology.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think since this is
the first time civilians

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.560 align:middle line:84%
have something like this,
it's a very good chance

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can find it
and give it to anyone

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
who wants to develop
this kind of technology.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Well,
some of the analysis

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:84%
seems to reveal what
appears to be a Tesla tower

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and some kind of
Tesla technology,

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
which is something that Tesla
wanted to do in the beginning,

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:90%
was free distribution of power.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that
you're looking into?

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And can you describe
this Tesla tower?

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, it's
like a little jar, where

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:15.110 align:middle line:84%
you see something big
around in the bottom,

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and you can see a long
neck to the other side.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.650 align:middle line:84%
We think that Tesla
tower that is inside,

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
if we can move it, if
we can make it spin,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:84%
will create
electromagnetic energy that

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
will help levitate the sphere,
will create energy all around.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And with that, the gravity
will be completely neutralized,

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:90%
and this will be able to fly.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.340 align:middle line:90%
You have the videos.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:90%
You have the new videos, even.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:84%
There are at least three times
these spheres have come back

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.450 align:middle line:90%
to the area.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: Jaime, we've had
videos of spheres outside

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:10%
of passenger planes.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
We've had spheres at airports
in the United Kingdom.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:84%
The videos seem to be appearing
nearly daily now on spheres.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:10%
We have them in Iraq.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:10%
We have them in wartime
scenarios, too, as well.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.680 align:middle line:84%
We have the Department of
Defense producing videos,

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:90%
What does that suggest to you?

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not just Colombia.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Are these fears visiting
us all around the world?

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And is this a big
science experiment?

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose?

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Remember,
this is a big sensor.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:38.180 align:middle line:84%
With this sensor, they can
find out everything about us.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they are doing, they
are getting the information.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think right now, because
what happened last Saturday,

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:84%
June the 7th, I really think
that these spheres are coming

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
back to try to
communicate with us.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:84%
It's crazy for me to say
that, but it's very possible.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:10%
>>CHURCH: Is all of this a
response to the Arecibo message

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:15.820 align:middle line:10%
from 1974, when we were asking
for communication with ET,

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:10%
and we sent it out
there, and now it

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.977 align:middle line:10%
seems that it's
actually happening?

00:22:20.977 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:10%
>>MAUSSAN: I think that's right.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.960 align:middle line:10%
And if you remember the Arecibo
message, right in the bottom,

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.510 align:middle line:10%
there is an antenna, suggesting
an antenna, their antenna.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And you know it's exactly
the same like this.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
That is why we think
it's communication.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And now that we
have this, we will

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:84%
try to communicate with them
through their own sphere.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But I think they are getting
closer, and closer, and closer,

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:57.110 align:middle line:84%
because for me, they're looking
for communication with us.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
they are presenting

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:90%
themselves closer and closer.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And also, they are
probably worried

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
about what is
happening on Earth,

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:84%
because probably, they know
about the climate change.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:18.082 align:middle line:84%
Probably, they know
about all the pollution,

00:23:18.082 --> 00:23:22.720 align:middle line:84%
all the chemicals,
the apocalypse

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.370 align:middle line:84%
of the insects, everything that
is happening that is terrible.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And probably, they know and
they want to register that.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:84%
They want the
information, or they

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.380 align:middle line:84%
want to stop that and try
to communicate with us.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I hope they want to
communicate with us.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Probably in that effort,
they lost this sphere,

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:49.790 align:middle line:84%
but now we can probably use it
to communicate back with them.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: It's
covered in symbols,

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:56.480 align:middle line:84%
what appear to be hieroglyphics,
a language of some kind.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:90%
It almost looks ancient.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:84%
What are these
symbols telling us?

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.380 align:middle line:90%
And is that part of the message?

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah, it is.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to find
out, and we don't know yet.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:84%
I know many people around the
world are trying to find out.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Probably, one of them
will be able to find

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:18.400 align:middle line:84%
the key, the code,
the Rosetta Stone

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand
what is there.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:90%
So far, we have not been able.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you see
everything here, it's

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
very, very rustic, very
artisanal, very handcrafted.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It was done probably with
the hands, not with machines.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's a real mystery if
you consider the high technology

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.860 align:middle line:90%
that is inside the sphere.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: What about AI?

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Can't we use AI to look at
this and possibly decipher what

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.910 align:middle line:90%
is written?

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: It's being used
not by me, but by many.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.500 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to find the
best in the world to do this,

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and I am sure that sooner or
later, we will have an idea.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that a message?

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that an ID?

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Is that instructions how
to operate the sphere?

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:14.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:84%
There are signs from
different, how do you say,

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:84%
alphabets, languages, but there
is nothing like this on Earth.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Some letters, yes.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Some symbols, yes,
but that is all.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.490 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense yet.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: What about a
correlation or connection

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:90%
with crop circles?

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: There is one
circle, the 25th of July, 2010.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:90%
The circle was like this.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We were able to make
it three dimensional,

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and it looks very, very
similar to the sphere.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:55.440 align:middle line:84%
This was created,
what, 15 years ago.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting,
but that is all.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't have more
information than that.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, with the
witnesses going back

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to José, and possibly
David, we had

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of electromagnetic
properties that were exhibited.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Something else
interesting happened

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.490 align:middle line:84%
where there was a description
of water vaporizing

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:84%
as soon as it
touched the sphere,

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and that smoke was
also seen emitting

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:90%
from the sphere in flight.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Can you go back to that and
explain what was going on?

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And have you dipped
this in water?

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yes, I
have done it, yes.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But to get the same thing is we
need to put the energy inside.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.580 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's
not happening now

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.410 align:middle line:84%
is because the sphere
is completely dead.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:90%
There is no more energy there.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:90%
That is why it's very safe.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we want to put
some energy inside the sphere

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.930 align:middle line:84%
to see if we can make it
work, at least partially.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if we have
a fiber optics,

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
it's absolutely necessary
to have electricity.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
electricity, it's

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.890 align:middle line:84%
because this was produced
by the same sphere.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:84%
It's I think what we know and
what we are going to try to do.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: How old
do you think it is?

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Is there any dating?

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: We were trying to
see if, through the plastics,

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:90%
that it's--

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:84%
because the fiber
optics is a polymer.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And we were trying to find
out through this polymer.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
But in Mexico, we have
not found a laboratory

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:48.580 align:middle line:84%
that can test polymers
to find the age.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Probably once international
scientists get involved in this,

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:84%
we will be able to
find more about this,

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.940 align:middle line:90%
but it looks very old.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.260 align:middle line:84%
If you consider everything
here, it looks very old.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I
tell you, it's very modern.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It's modern and old.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Why they did it that way?

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't know more
than we know yet.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: You have
said, and the witnesses

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:20.350 align:middle line:84%
have said, that the sphere
was spinning rapidly.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And was that part of its flight,
or was it something else?

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain that?

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: No, we think that's
the way it produces the energy.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes the
sphere can stand still,

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and probably, they can
use the fiber optics.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's spinning.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I think it spins when it
needs energy and produce

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:48.210 align:middle line:84%
their own energy, and
stand still when they

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:90%
want to use the fiber optics.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:84%
With the new video that
we will talk later,

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:57.540 align:middle line:84%
you will see the spinning,
and you will see it standing,

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and you will see
that it happens.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:05.730 align:middle line:90%
The two possibilities are there.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:10.930 align:middle line:84%
This is self-sufficient in
energy, and at the same time,

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.580 align:middle line:84%
it can use the energy
that produces to create

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.450 align:middle line:90%
images and information.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: This is a lot of data.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of analysis.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot of
witnesses, Jaime.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:84%
But taking the leap to
something not of this Earth that

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:84%
is visiting us from out there,
is the data strong enough

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:34.920 align:middle line:90%
for that?

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: Do you know spheres?

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:90%
10 kilos that can fly?

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:45.860 align:middle line:84%
I have at least two,
four, six videos

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.570 align:middle line:84%
proving that with
that kind of speed.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:52.250 align:middle line:84%
If somebody gives
me a better idea,

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:56.640 align:middle line:84%
if the government has this,
why we don't know yet.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I think if the
American government has

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:84%
these kind of spheres,
we would know about it

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:84%
because they would be being
used in different areas

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.820 align:middle line:90%
because they are sensors.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.130 align:middle line:84%
It's hypothetical, but I
don't know yet anything

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:90%
similar to this in the world.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists who
have investigated this,

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:84%
they have not seen
anything like this before,

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:84%
fiber optics inside
a sphere like this,

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of fiber optics,
all kind of different sizes.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's unbelievable.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
is inside, where

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:90%
is the technology to do that?

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I consider that
it's a very good possibility

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.270 align:middle line:90%
that is not from this Earth.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, when you
suggest fiber optics,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.440 align:middle line:90%
is this analysis from X-rays?

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.077 align:middle line:84%
Or have you seen the
fiber optics themselves?

00:30:53.077 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I've seen
the fiber optics.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:84%
We have seen them
with microscopes.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But more than that, the
university took samples

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:06.050 align:middle line:84%
from inside the hole, and they
found the fiber optics inside,

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:90%
chemically and physically.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.690 align:middle line:84%
The scientists who did the
investigation, top of the line,

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:90%
even by American standards.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.440 align:middle line:90%
This man worked in Boeing.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:90%
This man worked in England.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:84%
This is an associated professor
in many different universities,

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:27.980 align:middle line:84%
has published more than 150
articles, scientific articles

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:90%
of high quality.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.200 align:middle line:90%
It's top of the line.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, I didn't
sleep for two nights

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:84%
before I told you that
we found fiber optics.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.810 align:middle line:90%
I needed to be sure.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's why he took samples.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And he looked through
them in a microscope

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.400 align:middle line:90%
of millions of dollars.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to find,
physically, fiber optics.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Is not just that we think.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:90%
We know it has fiber optics.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:84%
I can send you the images of
the little wires of the fiber

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.200 align:middle line:90%
optics inside the holes.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Every single hole
has fiber optics.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.570 align:middle line:84%
We thought that probably
one or two had it,

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:20.870 align:middle line:84%
but now we know that almost
all of them have fiber optics.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.010 align:middle line:90%
And let me tell you something.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:26.760 align:middle line:84%
We are open to continue
the investigation.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.180 align:middle line:84%
We are open to receive
American scientists.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.270 align:middle line:84%
The only thing, they have
to be done in Mexico.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.410 align:middle line:90%
Why Mexico?

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I cannot take
the chances to take,

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and not to the US,
to anywhere else.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:48.911 align:middle line:84%
Here I have it in a safe,
in a safe from a bank.

00:32:48.911 --> 00:32:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have a guards with
guns around the sphere.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way
you can keep this,

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.600 align:middle line:84%
because the more
time has passed,

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.660 align:middle line:84%
we will have more
ambition, more people

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.530 align:middle line:90%
trying to get this sphere.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.420 align:middle line:90%
We have to be very careful.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Then I cannot take
it now anywhere else.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: The next
stage would be

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:16.520 align:middle line:84%
to analyze what's
inside directly.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Would you authorize
somebody cutting this open?

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: No, no, no, no.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Anything that has to be done
has to be done from the outside

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:29.840 align:middle line:84%
without hurting the sphere,
because if we don't have the way

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.970 align:middle line:84%
to know what is inside, we
will have it in the future.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:37.440 align:middle line:84%
But if we cut the sphere and we
don't understand what is inside,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.970 align:middle line:90%
then we lost it.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:90%
We lost the sphere.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.600 align:middle line:84%
There is too much
risk to do that.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.400 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Until as long as I
am alive, nobody's

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.750 align:middle line:90%
going to cut this sphere.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: You have to
get a camera in there.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.500 align:middle line:90%
We have to see what's inside.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: Yeah, probably we can
do it through one of the holes,

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:01.290 align:middle line:84%
There are two of the holes that
it seems that they go inside,

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.640 align:middle line:90%
deep inside.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Probably through
there, we will be

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:09.739 align:middle line:84%
able to take a camera
and look what is inside.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, it seems that
there are videos every day

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:19.530 align:middle line:84%
now popping up, showing spheres
in flight, metallic spheres.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.719 align:middle line:84%
I watched another
one earlier today

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
that was here in
the United States.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:29.219 align:middle line:84%
I find it very interesting
and very compelling.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:84%
You just got a brand new video
that was shot on June 7th.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: It's the best.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the best.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.179 align:middle line:84%
It was recorded
with a new camera,

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and the image is
crisp, clear, perfect.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, beautiful.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:55.610 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, you can see that
it's the same kind of sphere.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:00.130 align:middle line:84%
You can see the belt.
You can see the holes.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a proof that
these spheres, the same kind

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:08.290 align:middle line:90%
of sphere, can fly.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's very important
because people complain

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.900 align:middle line:84%
that, with the
original videos, you

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.377 align:middle line:90%
didn't see all these details.

00:35:15.377 --> 00:35:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Why they didn't see?

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the cameras
were not new.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:90%
They were from 2019.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And the technology in the
cameras of the cell phones five,

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.520 align:middle line:84%
six years ago, six years ago
it's not the same than now.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a very
different technology.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And now we are able
to check that video.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.450 align:middle line:84%
You will be very happy
to see every detail

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.940 align:middle line:90%
from this sphere in a video.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.820 align:middle line:90%
And more than that.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:54.400 align:middle line:84%
You will see the sphere
playing with the people

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.520 align:middle line:90%
that are recording.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.740 align:middle line:84%
The sphere goes inside
the sugar canes and hides,

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.300 align:middle line:90%
and then comes back up.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And this man said, oh, like
a little kid saying boo.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:13.040 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Then you see
they are intelligent.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:84%
They are being moved by someone
who knows what they are doing,

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.960 align:middle line:84%
or probably they
have AI, and they

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.920 align:middle line:90%
are able to move by themselves.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but
it's incredible.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible
what is happening.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: With the messages that
we sent out, both with Arecibo

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and SETI, we have
provided information

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:40.460 align:middle line:84%
about us, our DNA, the
location of our planet,

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.430 align:middle line:84%
how many planets are
in our star system.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:47.560 align:middle line:84%
We've done a lot of different
things in a simplistic way

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.420 align:middle line:84%
to hopefully communicate with
ET if they did find something

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.440 align:middle line:90%
from us.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And we also did it with Voyager.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
there are messages

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:02.500 align:middle line:84%
on this sphere telling
us who they are

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:90%
and where we can find them?

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MAUSSAN: I think the
message is right here.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.180 align:middle line:84%
When we are able
to decipher that--

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.870 align:middle line:90%
and that's one.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is to use
the antennas to communicate

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.840 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.090 align:middle line:90%
What if we can do that?

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:21.400 align:middle line:84%
What if we send a
message through here

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and we receive a message
in any other way?

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I am very hopeful that this
story is just the beginning.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.820 align:middle line:90%
This story can change humanity.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm very happy.

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm very humbled to
have been able to get

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:43.120 align:middle line:84%
this sphere, because probably,
if I wouldn't have done it, now,

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.540 align:middle line:90%
right now, it would be lost.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Probably, the Colombian
government would find out

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:90%
and they would take it.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Or I don't know.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Probably some criminal
that say I want this.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:58.300 align:middle line:90%
They were very much afraid.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.040 align:middle line:90%
David was very much afraid.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Somebody could took
it from here by force,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:84%
by threatening his
family or someone.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he said,
Jaime, it's yours.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Take it to Mexico.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And now, here, I am taking
all kind of precautions

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.950 align:middle line:90%
to keep it as long as I can.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.800 align:middle line:90%
And this doesn't belong to me.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.620 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to the people.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.640 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't have an owner.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.920 align:middle line:90%
The owners are somewhere else.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
belongs to the people.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.170 align:middle line:84%
If the people, you,
the scientists,

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:39.650 align:middle line:84%
want to help me to do
something with this sphere,

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:42.010 align:middle line:90%
I am open to do it.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.460 align:middle line:90%
I am the keeper.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.650 align:middle line:90%
That's all I am.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: This is
not a USA thing.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly not
a Colombia thing,

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:56.560 align:middle line:84%
where there must be other
spheres out there, Jaime.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And having this technology
in civilian hands,

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.580 align:middle line:84%
as you have stated,
is probably something

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:08.440 align:middle line:84%
that most wouldn't
want to have happen.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that other
governments are in possession

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.920 align:middle line:90%
of their own spheres?

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MAUSSAN: It's very possible.

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:18.470 align:middle line:84%
It's very possible
that these spheres--

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:84%
if this sphere had an
accident, very, very possible

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
other spheres had
accidents before.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.900 align:middle line:10%
But normally, what people
do is, you find this,

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.350 align:middle line:10%
and then you don't know what it
is, and you call the government.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And the government takes it,
and you never know what it is.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.900 align:middle line:84%
The incredible thing,
my friend, Jimmy,

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.820 align:middle line:84%
is that it was
being recorded as it

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.620 align:middle line:90%
landed because it didn't fall.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Landed.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.780 align:middle line:10%
And you can see the man
running, taking the sphere.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.950 align:middle line:10%
That is one in a million--
one in 10 million.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:00.890 align:middle line:84%
If they find this
sphere somewhere else,

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and they tell me it's
extraterrestrial,

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.580 align:middle line:90%
I say, no, come on.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.650 align:middle line:90%
It's handcrafted.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:06.830 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:13.460 align:middle line:84%
But when I saw the video, I
said, this is the real deal.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.180 align:middle line:84%
These people are not
faking that video.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.320 align:middle line:90%
This is very simple people.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.540 align:middle line:84%
The man who found this
sells little things

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.040 align:middle line:90%
in the market Sunday in Buga.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.740 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have a penny to
build something like this.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And all he did was to
record it, and that's

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.710 align:middle line:84%
the most incredible
video I have ever seen.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.400 align:middle line:90%
And something else.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:44.850 align:middle line:10%
On May 31st, my son who
lives very near the office,

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:51.480 align:middle line:10%
on a Saturday, 31st, 1:30 PM, he
saw a sphere flying around his

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.290 align:middle line:10%
house.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:57.340 align:middle line:10%
And the sphere came down to
the ground and looked around.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:01.755 align:middle line:10%
It was moving very
near this office.

00:41:01.755 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:10%
Everybody says they were
looking for the sphere.

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:06.790 align:middle line:10%
The sphere is sending signals.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.140 align:middle line:10%
They are coming.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.430 align:middle line:10%
It's probably the same happening
in El Cena and near Buga.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.070 align:middle line:10%
And now it's happening in Jumbo.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:20.760 align:middle line:10%
The last video is from
Jumbo in the Valle de Cauca.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It's where all these areas,
all these places are.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of them have been
recording these spheres

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:29.950 align:middle line:90%
in three different places.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
amazing, I think.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.370 align:middle line:84%
In the last three
months, it's incredible.

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It was taken to the
University in Mexico.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was recorded
another sphere right there.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Is this a coincidence?

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Or they are looking
for the sphere?

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Well, you
know the old saying.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Extraordinary claims
require extraordinary proof.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has always asked
for something like this.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Now we have an object.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:00.130 align:middle line:84%
We have something
that we can test,

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:02.910 align:middle line:84%
something we can look
into, and see if we

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.170 align:middle line:90%
can move this a step further.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:06.700 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank you, Jaime.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.220 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely
compelling and extraordinary.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Great show.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:11.860 align:middle line:90%
