00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.280 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.905 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:13.460 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.666 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
back to another edition

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.581 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:32.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and we're
talking with the remote viewer

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:10%
and the author of "Reading
the Enemy's Mind,"

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:10%
Paul Smith, who in
our first program

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.460 align:middle line:10%
brought us some enlightening
facts about remote viewing.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.195 align:middle line:84%
Paul, it's
fascinating, really is.

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL SMITH: I'll
tell you what,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I think there's not a more
exciting topic present today

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now how do you
distinguish the difference

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
between remote viewing
and, let's say, intuition?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Or is it the same?

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, I think
that the engine that

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:10%
makes them both run, the
underlying human faculty that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:10%
makes them both work,
is probably the same.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.850 align:middle line:10%
They probably emerged
from the same source.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.665 align:middle line:10%
Remote viewing is
different than intuition

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:13.550 align:middle line:10%
in that it's a more formalized,
structured approach to-- you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:10%
might say it's even almost
applied intuition, applied

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.167 align:middle line:10%
and directed intuition.

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had a
remote viewing session that

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:84%
scared the living
daylights out of you?

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I have not
had any that scared me,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:84%
but I've had some
the disturbed me.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about them?

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
One of them-- of course, a
lot of what I have to tell you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:84%
are things that I
experienced while I

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:84%
was a remote viewer
with the military.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.895 align:middle line:84%
One that sticks with me
to this day is the target,

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:42.770 align:middle line:84%
it turned out-- of course
as a remote viewer,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.394 align:middle line:84%
you're not supposed
to know what target

00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:46.130 align:middle line:84%
is-- so the target,
it turned out,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:84%
was an accident in a biological
research facility in the Soviet

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Union that we'd got
wind that had happened.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.456 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to see if
they could get some more

00:01:56.456 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:90%
information about what occurred.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And so all of us in the
military remote viewing unit

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:84%
had been targeted on
this particular event.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.437 align:middle line:84%
And my experience was--
we went down there.

00:02:07.437 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
It felt like it was
underground-- turned out

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:90%
it was.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:90%
There were these corridors.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
It was very institutional,
almost you might say,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.606 align:middle line:84%
1950s, in the way
the United States

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:17.897 align:middle line:90%
institutional architecture was.

00:02:17.897 --> 00:02:20.759 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of like that.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:90%
But I also knew it was foreign.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.508 align:middle line:84%
And I got the
impression that there

00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:25.885 align:middle line:84%
was this stuff in
the air, and that it

00:02:25.885 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
was very-- I'd say toxic,
describing it today.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And I came across
a person in there,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and they were in the process of
choking to death on this stuff.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.351 align:middle line:90%
And that was unsettling.

00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:90%
That disturbed me quite a bit.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it was almost as
if I could kind of have

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.854 align:middle line:84%
that experience with them,
and not pleasant all.

00:02:44.854 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They may have died.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think
probably did, actually.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
That was my final conclusion,
that they probably did.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Now fortunately, the
remote viewing methodology

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
we had been taught--
we were also

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.763 align:middle line:84%
taught ways to deal with
these kind of stressful kind

00:02:57.763 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of emotional encounters
that we might have.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not something
that traumatized me

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:90%
for life or anything.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But it did disturb
me at the time.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I can recall how
that felt back then.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And so that's is
one of the examples.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is remote viewing
more powerful in real time,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:90%
or does it matter?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.985 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So that's
actually a trick question,

00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:20.496 align:middle line:90%
and you don't even realize it.

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe I did.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The reason
is, technically,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:84%
if you consider the way
human consciousness works,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
there is no present to
human consciousness.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.001 align:middle line:84%
Because we have this,
oh, roughly tenth

00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.625 align:middle line:84%
of a second consciousness window
between when something happens

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and when we
recognize it happens.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.494 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is remote view
either the very recent past,

00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:84%
which we interpret
as the present,

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
or a distanter past,
which is in the past.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense,
it's equally-- it's

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
almost the same remote
viewing present as it is past.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And so they're pretty much
the same, accuracy wise.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Where the accuracy
level falls off

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.060 align:middle line:84%
is where you try to remote
view into the future.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.562 align:middle line:84%
And there it becomes
really hit or miss,

00:04:04.562 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:84%
except for one particular
modality, which

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:90%
we can talk about later.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.769 align:middle line:84%
But it becomes very hit or miss
where they're actually going

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to describe an actual future
outcome or just something that

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.991 align:middle line:90%
could have happened, but didn't.

00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just brought up
something that was interesting,

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.220 align:middle line:84%
that we see things
in a nanosecond

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
after it's occurred
with the real eyes.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Are we looking at an
event that has already

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
happened by the time it
registers in our brain,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:84%
even it may be a minute
part of a second,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's already done by
the time it gets to us?

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So the way the
human perceptual system works

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.724 align:middle line:84%
is that the eyes actually
pick it up real time.

00:04:40.724 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's electromagnetic
radiation-- transmission time

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:84%
between me and you
is so short that it's

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:90%
essentially instantaneous.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.671 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But am I seeing with
my eyes or also my brain?

00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But it's your
brain that actually picks up

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
that, processes it, and
tells you what it is

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:90%
and what it means.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's what takes the time.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So the sensory detection
happens instantly.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.302 align:middle line:84%
The sensory
processing is delayed.

00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like in a
sports event, where there's

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.635 align:middle line:84%
an eight-second delay, or
whatever it is, you know,

00:05:05.635 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
so that, if something
happens, they

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.242 align:middle line:84%
can go to commercial
real quick or something.

00:05:09.242 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No wonder
when I go to hug

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.374 align:middle line:84%
some woman I missed
her by three feet.

00:05:12.374 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: She was in a hurry.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She already moved.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the fact
is that's why people can--

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.740 align:middle line:84%
you hear these stories
in haunting literature,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and life after death stuff
where people are dead,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.675 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
know they're dead.

00:05:27.675 --> 00:05:29.216 align:middle line:84%
Like they might be
in a car accident,

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and then people
find they're ghosts,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, the
ghost says-- in some

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.422 align:middle line:84%
of the near-death
literature, they

00:05:38.422 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:84%
encounter people who are dead,
but don't know they're dead.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.460 align:middle line:84%
It's because if you get killed
before the brain can process

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.416 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you have died,
under the presumption, which

00:05:49.416 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
I fully believe, that
consciousness continues

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
after death, you can actually
be dead and not even know it.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people
are remote viewing,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:84%
are they also remote viewing
in their dream state?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Or is that precognition?

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, I mean, there are
a lot of precognitive dreams.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.165 align:middle line:84%
People talk about-- in fact, my
late web mistress, the person

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
who put up my
website, unfortunately

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.143 align:middle line:90%
passed away a couple years back.

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sorry to hear that.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But she told me
about a dream her brother had,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:84%
in which he had
been driving to work

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.026 align:middle line:84%
in this dream, the
normal route he took,

00:06:23.026 --> 00:06:25.605 align:middle line:84%
and he came to the intersection,
and a car ran a red light,

00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:90%
and smashed into him.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've had one of those.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We all have.

00:06:28.675 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the next day,
when he was on the road,

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:84%
he came to that intersection,
and he remembered the dream.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:90%
And so he just paused.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:84%
He slowed down, even though
the light was in his favor.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.869 align:middle line:84%
And just as he
slowed down, a car

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:39.410 align:middle line:84%
went barreling
through the red light.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.451 align:middle line:84%
If he had not done that,
if he had not hesitated,

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:90%
he'd have been t-boned.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's a precognitive dream.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.490 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually been
a fair amount of research

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:84%
of clairvoyance, or remote
viewing, if you will,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:90%
in a dream state.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that you can also
do present-time remote viewing

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:90%
in that environment, as well.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.519 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You started
this with the military.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:84%
That's how you got into
this, and you got into it

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:90%
in a big way.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the military all of a
sudden just disbanded the unit.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Why did they do that?

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it looked
to the civilian population,

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
the public, that it was
sudden, but it wasn't.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.971 align:middle line:84%
One of the big problems
with anything in government

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:20.095 align:middle line:84%
that's controversial is
that you'll have supporters

00:07:20.095 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:90%
and you'll have detractors.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was the history
of the remote viewing

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:84%
program from when it first
started in 1972, all the way

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.070 align:middle line:84%
up to when it
ended in late 1995,

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.080 align:middle line:84%
is that when the
supporters had the power,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.510 align:middle line:90%
the program prospered.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.885 align:middle line:84%
And when they didn't, and
the detractors had the power,

00:07:38.885 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:90%
then it didn't.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then it died.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.858 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And the
fact of the matter

00:07:41.858 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:84%
is, I mean, at its probably
highest point politically,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.150 align:middle line:84%
there were five
congressman-- I'm sorry,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.035 align:middle line:84%
five senators and a number of
congressman, at least-- these

00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:84%
are the ones I know
about-- who are

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
very much in support
of the program.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it prospered
during that period.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But those guys retired,
died, went away.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the generals
that were in support of it

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:90%
got forced out, whatever.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when it came into
the mid-90s, first of all,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:90%
there was a lot of attrition.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.997 align:middle line:84%
Viewers were taken away
and weren't replaced,

00:08:11.997 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:84%
because the managers wanted
to try and kill the program,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
in spite of the
senatorial interest.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, the
CIA director, at time

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:84%
it was transferred from the
Defense Intelligence Agency

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.980 align:middle line:84%
to the CIA, was one
of those guys that

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.767 align:middle line:84%
just wouldn't have
anything to do with it.

00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
He would kick people
out of his office

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.400 align:middle line:84%
if they even brought
the topic up.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And so consequently, it was
in a very harsh environment.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.448 align:middle line:84%
And that was the point
it got terminated.

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we do the
program because the Soviets

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.949 align:middle line:90%
were doing it?

00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That was
originally the impetus.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.606 align:middle line:84%
The CIA had been, of
course, monitoring

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.771 align:middle line:90%
what the Soviets were up to.

00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered
the Soviets were

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:84%
pursuing what we would
call parapsychology

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and spending literally hundreds
of millions of dollars on it--

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
much more money than
we ever spent on it.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA knew that the
Soviets didn't do anything

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.655 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't hope to have
some kind of a return on.

00:09:01.655 --> 00:09:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So they had to investigate it to
make sure it wasn't actually--

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.363 align:middle line:90%
they didn't believe in it.

00:09:05.363 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
The CIA, in general,
didn't believe in ESP.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.979 align:middle line:84%
But the Soviets apparently did,
and they needed to know why.

00:09:09.979 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
got the program going.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.920 align:middle line:84%
But later on, we discovered
it did have utility.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.145 align:middle line:84%
Because originally it was kind
of a proof of principle thing--

00:09:18.145 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to do what we
think the Soviets are doing

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.560 align:middle line:90%
and see if it works.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
When it did work, well,
heck, if it works,

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.887 align:middle line:90%
why do we waste it just testing?

00:09:25.887 --> 00:09:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's go ahead and use it.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's use it.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tha't
right, utilize it.

00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And so at that
point, it became valuable

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.322 align:middle line:84%
and, indeed, got used
for quite a while.

00:09:34.322 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know the
Russians aren't still doing it?

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.787 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, as far
as I know, we don't.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they could be.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They could be.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or the Chinese.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Evidence seems
indicate they're probably not,

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.441 align:middle line:84%
because particularly after
the Cold War closed down,

00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:90%
they were really cash starved.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.189 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
doing anything that

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:90%
wasn't absolutely essential.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence is
that they did close down

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:90%
all that research at that time.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Have they picked
it back up again?

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:84%
There is a scientist in
the remote viewing field,

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
American scientist
named Ed May, who's

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:84%
done some really great
work over the years.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually been involved
with the former members

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
of that Russian
program and whoever

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:90%
else is involved in it today.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And he's promising to come out
with some books, actually, that

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:84%
will talk about the
Russian side of it.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm anxious to see
what comes of that.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, I
had the opportunity

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:84%
to see you sometime back at the
International Remote Viewing

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Association conference
dedicated to remote viewing.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I find that fascinating
all by itself.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It's an organized
group of people.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.070 align:middle line:90%
How big is it?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I am not
sure on the membership,

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:84%
because I am not in
the presidency anymore,

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:84%
but I think we probably have
400 or 500 official formal--

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's--

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --members.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --big

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's good sized.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:45.831 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a whole
bunch more interested people,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.162 align:middle line:84%
who come to the conferences and
participate in the discussion

00:10:52.162 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:90%
groups, and things like that.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pretty good
size organization

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
for what might be considered a
kind of small sort of interest

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:90%
in the parapsychology field.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the reasons it
is of such interest in the world

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
is because, first
of all, it does

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:90%
have practical applications.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
But more interestingly
is the military did it,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and people recognize military
does things that work.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Military doesn't care about the
politics, generally speaking.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:84%
The military doesn't care
so much about the science

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:90%
if it does work.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And the military used
it for, if you add up

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:84%
the time it was in the
intelligence community, 23

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's a pretty good
validation of something

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.120 align:middle line:84%
that otherwise is
kind of squishy-- ESP,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.207 align:middle line:84%
we talk about all those
problems in general ESP.

00:11:37.207 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:84%
But here's something
that actually you

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.510 align:middle line:90%
can repeat in remote viewing.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.552 align:middle line:84%
And again, you don't
repeat it all the time,

00:11:42.552 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:84%
but there are other
phenomenon in science

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:90%
you don't repeat every time.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.726 align:middle line:84%
But you can repeat
it often enough

00:11:46.726 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:90%
that you know that it does work.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
that's the reason why

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:84%
it has so much
interest in the world.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're at home
watching this program right

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
now, Paul, somebody's
probably saying,

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:84%
hey, so maybe I should
dabble in remote viewing.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.864 align:middle line:84%
What's the benefit to
somebody to do this?

00:12:01.864 --> 00:12:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well we
talked about one,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.264 align:middle line:84%
where it enhances intuition
in just normal everyday life.

00:12:07.264 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're not
remote viewing,

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.684 align:middle line:84%
your intuition has been
improved in normal cases.

00:12:13.684 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's a
self-validating thing,

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of
people appreciate.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Here's something
that tells me, yes, I

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:90%
am more than my physical body.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just this meat machine
that science says I am.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:84%
But you can use it in
a number of other ways.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.632 align:middle line:84%
Investment is probably one of
the biggest popular things now.

00:12:28.632 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would that work?

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
what they do is use

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.380 align:middle line:84%
a thing called associative
remote viewing.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of applying remote
viewing to actually predict

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.210 align:middle line:84%
the outcome of a
future event that

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.043 align:middle line:84%
has a number of different
possible outcomes.

00:12:40.043 --> 00:12:42.072 align:middle line:84%
So the prime example
is sports betting,

00:12:42.072 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:90%
and it often is used in that.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.729 align:middle line:84%
So you want to know if the
Longhorns or A&M are going

00:12:46.729 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to win the football game
becasue you want to bet on it.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what the point
spread's going to be, right?

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.257 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you have
to figure that in, too.

00:12:52.257 --> 00:12:52.433 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a bit tougher.

00:12:52.433 --> 00:12:54.391 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But we'll keep
it simple for this one.

00:12:54.391 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Win or lose, that's all we're
worried about right now.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.261 align:middle line:84%
You want to know, because you
want to bet on the game, right?

00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:10%
So what you do, well, if
you ask a remote viewer,

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:10%
OK, A&M and UT
are going to play,

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:10%
and we want you to tell us
which one is going to win,

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:10%
it won't be any
better than chance.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
It essentially will
amount to a guess,

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.715 align:middle line:84%
because they're consciously
choosing between two things.

00:13:14.715 --> 00:13:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you want to
do is try and leverage

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious processing
that isn't biased

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.710 align:middle line:84%
by this conscious mental noise
stuff that we talked about.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you take
advantage of the remote viewing

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:84%
thing, and you tell
a remote viewer,

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.657 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to show you
an object in the future.

00:13:32.657 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
describe, right now,

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.294 align:middle line:90%
what that object is going to be.

00:13:36.294 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Now they're not
going to tell you.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.626 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you pick a
pencil and a hamburger

00:13:39.626 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:90%
as your two objects.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.562 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain how
this works in a second.

00:13:42.562 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to tell
you, if you show them

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.600 align:middle line:84%
a hamburger, that
it's a hamburger.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:10%
What they'll say instead
is, well, there's

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.809 align:middle line:10%
something round and fluffy and
smells like food, or something

00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:52.100 align:middle line:10%
like that, or smells like meat.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It won't get specific.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah, at
least they shouldn't,

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:10%
because usually
they're wrong when

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:10%
you start putting names to it.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But they'll describe it,
and they'll describe it

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
accurately enough so
you know it wasn't

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:90%
the pencil you gave them.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Now how this works is you decide
that the hamburger is going to,

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.800 align:middle line:84%
for example, stand for
UT winning the game.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And the pencil's
going to stand for--

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Michigan State.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, we're going Aggies.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:90%
We're going to keep this.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're going to stay.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.692 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:16.692 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wonder
where you're from.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.696 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Texas Aggies.

00:14:18.696 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So A&M-- so one's
for the Longhorns,

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
one's for A&M, right,
the pencil for A&M.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you wait and see
what happens in the game.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And UT wins, we'll assume,
if we're not biased here.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:90%
UT wins.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that
determines that you're

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
going to show the viewer
that hamburger after the game

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.484 align:middle line:90%
is over.

00:14:41.484 --> 00:14:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the day
after the game's over,

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
you have an appointment and
you say, OK, Mr. Remote Viewer,

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.866 align:middle line:84%
this is the object
you remote viewed.

00:14:48.866 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Now essentially
what you're doing

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.890 align:middle line:84%
is sending a signal from
the future to the past.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's one way
of looking at this.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So you're telling the
viewer from the future which

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
object they're
going to be seeing.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But the game determines
which object you show.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.344 align:middle line:84%
And so, if the viewer
describes a hamburger,

00:15:06.344 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:90%
say, OK, that's a hamburger.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.718 align:middle line:90%
That means UT's going to win.

00:15:08.718 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So you bet on UT
before the game.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Then after the game, you have to
show the viewer that hamburger,

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:90%
because that completes the loop.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:15.613 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the cycle.

00:15:15.613 --> 00:15:16.946 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's the information.

00:15:16.946 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And if, for example,
A&M wins, you've

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84%
got to show them the pencil,
and then the viewer's wrong.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's the one
out of three cases

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:90%
where the viewer gets it wrong.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.980 align:middle line:84%
But many ARV
repetitions over time

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.400 align:middle line:84%
have shown that it's
between 60 and 80% accurate,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:90%
which means if you--

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.416 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty good.

00:15:38.416 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's very good, if
you're on a 50-50 proposition,

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to break the bank.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And you do have to
be careful if you're

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:46.830 align:middle line:90%
doing stocks, for example.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:84%
You can have, like, 10 wins
in a row, but that 11th loss--

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could kill you.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --could kill you if
it's a big enough loss, right?

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.296 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to be careful.

00:15:54.296 --> 00:15:56.797 align:middle line:84%
And point spread
in sports betting

00:15:56.797 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:84%
is something you have
to allow for, as well.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.680 align:middle line:84%
There are ways to do it, but
it gets probably too technical

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.179 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:16:01.179 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know Russell
Targ, a great remote viewer,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.660 align:middle line:84%
had a group that worked on
commodities and futures,

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and apparently he did
very well with that.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, my son, at
the University of Colorado,

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
he took a class from
a professor there,

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Garret Moddal, who was
a physics professor.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:84%
He has a class in
parapsychology.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.640 align:middle line:84%
They don't call it that,
but that's what it is.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And for a class
project, they did

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.590 align:middle line:84%
an associative remote
viewing experiment

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
against the Dow Jones average,
one of the Dow Jones averages.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's an auditor
there who happened

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.551 align:middle line:84%
to be a dotcom millionaire, and
he kicked in 10K of seed money.

00:16:38.551 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:84%
By the time they
were done, they had

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.570 align:middle line:84%
made seven correct
predictions in a row,

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and they had turned
that 10K into $27,000.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:10%
Not bad,

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.060 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And that was
a science experiment.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Not bad.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:10%
It worked.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
How can you use remote viewing
in police applications?

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's a
lot of similarity

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.380 align:middle line:84%
between what we had to do
in the military program

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and what police need to do.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is, like, maybe
find missing people,

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
maybe find who did it when,
maybe find out what happened,

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.300 align:middle line:84%
maybe find out what's
going to happen,

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:90%
all those very similar things.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:84%
And so oftentimes remote
viewers can benefit the police

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
in answering any one of
those particular questions.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:84%
I've had some experiences with
folks that I've worked with.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:24.215 align:middle line:84%
One case that we were asked to
find a missing body-- the story

00:17:24.215 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:90%
is interesting.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:84%
A police sergeant was
actually the murderer.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:10%
And he had actually--

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And he
was on the force?

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: He was on the
force when he did it.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:10%
He was trying to cover up
another crime that the guy had

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.650 align:middle line:10%
witnessed that the
officer had committed.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.119 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He killed him because
of a cover-up on a crime?

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.520 align:middle line:10%
He was trying to
cover up a crime.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.472 align:middle line:10%
And they figured out he did it.

00:17:45.472 --> 00:17:47.680 align:middle line:84%
They had enough evidence to
get him on second degree,

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:84%
but they wanted to get him
on first degree murder,

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.098 align:middle line:84%
because I mean, this
is a police officer.

00:17:51.098 --> 00:17:52.682 align:middle line:84%
You can't tolerate
that kind of thing.

00:17:52.682 --> 00:17:54.014 align:middle line:90%
But they couldn't find the body.

00:17:54.014 --> 00:17:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Unless they found the
body, they would have to--

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go with second.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.563 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:57.563 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:10%
And so we were approached
and asked to try and find it.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.360 align:middle line:10%
And we provided a very
accurate description

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.590 align:middle line:10%
of where the body was.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:90%
In fact--

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't know the
nuances of the case right?

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I did, but
I was managing it.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.255 align:middle line:90%
The viewers did not.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even know they
were looking for a body.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:84%
They had to figure
that out as they're

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:90%
going through the process.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so our information,
actually, was quite accurate.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But ironically-- and this is
one of those non-coincidences

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:90%
that occur.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
At the exact-- literally,
at the exact minute

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.125 align:middle line:84%
that the team of deputies were
going to take our information

00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and go out, and try and match
it to a location in the county

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:84%
they were working in, three
hikers came across the body.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.315 align:middle line:84%
And the downside was
we don't get the credit

00:18:41.315 --> 00:18:42.515 align:middle line:90%
as a remote viewing win.

00:18:42.515 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:90%
I think it would have been.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.806 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would have been.

00:18:44.806 --> 00:18:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But the upside
was that the deputy was

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:84%
able to go to the location
with our information

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and, with a digital
camera, document everything

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.949 align:middle line:84%
that we had reported, and
compare it and contrast it.

00:18:54.949 --> 00:18:56.281 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it was right there.

00:18:56.281 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: It was awesome.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:10%
It was an excellent result.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are three remote
viewers better than one

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:90%
when you're doing something?

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The answer is maybe.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.476 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.476 --> 00:19:10.975 align:middle line:84%
Again, because
remote viewing, there

00:19:10.975 --> 00:19:12.540 align:middle line:84%
are these parameters
that we don't really

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.623 align:middle line:84%
understand when it works
and when it doesn't work.

00:19:14.623 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes one viewer
will get it right

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and two viewers
will get it wrong.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have five,
one will get it right,

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.071 align:middle line:84%
and the other four
will get it wrong.

00:19:22.071 --> 00:19:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
you know what's right

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:90%
and what's wrong at that time?

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.513 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's the trick.

00:19:25.513 --> 00:19:27.130 align:middle line:84%
I'll maybe talk
about it in a second.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But more often
than not, there'll

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:84%
be correlation
between the three,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:84%
or the five, or however
many you're using,

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.496 align:middle line:84%
that will allow you
to come up with kind

00:19:34.496 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:84%
of a Venn diagram
of what's accurate.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.344 align:middle line:84%
And so we call it consensus
scoring, essentially.

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
that, usually that

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:84%
enhances the accuracy
of the results.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't always.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
How you resolve it when you
don't get that kind of a match?

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:84%
In the intelligence
world, we never

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.151 align:middle line:84%
did anything in an
intelligence vacuum.

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You usually got as many
sources involved as you could,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.316 align:middle line:84%
and as many disciplines
involved as you could,

00:19:57.316 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
so you had a kind of
a intelligence context

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.110 align:middle line:84%
that you could take your
information and compare it.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.019 align:middle line:84%
And in that situation,
if the two viewers

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:06.560 align:middle line:84%
are completely out of line and
couldn't possibly be accurate,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:84%
but the other one was kind
of right in the ballpark,

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and it agreed, and it cohered
with the other information,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.460 align:middle line:84%
then you could trust that
guy's information-- or girl.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Actually we had many
women viewers, as well.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: During
9/11, my daughter

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:84%
would tell me about
a dream she had

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:84%
of walking through the
streets of a big city

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
with tons of dust
falling on her.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Dad, it
was like six inches deep.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
But I remember
looking up in the sky

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and it was coming
down like snowflakes.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
She clearly described 9/11
and what was happening.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:10%
Of course, who knew that?

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:10%
We didn't.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Was that remote viewing?

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.969 align:middle line:90%
Or was it a precognitive dream?

00:20:49.969 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: What's the difference?

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Again, it's the same
underlying mechanism, I think,

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:90%
that drives it all.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.294 align:middle line:84%
It just expresses itself
in different modes

00:20:59.294 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:90%
through human consciousness.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
could she have done

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:84%
to push it a little
further, to get a little bit

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
more information so we could
realize what was going on?

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we thought-- the both of
us thought Yellowstone blew up,

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:10%
and the Caldera
sprinkled all that.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.434 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Or she'd watched
some movie or something.

00:21:16.434 --> 00:21:18.058 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody ever
would have thought

00:21:18.058 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:84%
about planes smashing
into a building.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So to answer the first
question, it's hard to say.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an expert in dream ESP.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:10%
But there have
been some attempts

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.186 align:middle line:10%
to try and expand on what
you experienced in one dream

00:21:33.186 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:10%
the next night in
a further dream

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:10%
by you saying, OK, now I want
to go back and revisit this.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:10%
What can I come up with?

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.935 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What can I
do when I see this?

00:21:39.935 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: That
might be some help.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting here,
I think, in this story,

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:84%
is it shows how
difficult precognition

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.150 align:middle line:84%
is to do something
with, in most cases.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
get an exact time.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
You often don't
get an exact place.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this guy's
car being smashed

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.270 align:middle line:84%
in the intersection,
that's a rare example where

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:90%
it's identifiable.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:84%
In this case, big city--
where in the world?

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is it?

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Ash raining down, where
does that come from, right?

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.770 align:middle line:10%
I have absolutely no doubt that
she got a real signal on this.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.019 align:middle line:10%
And a number of people did,
actually, it's surprising.

00:22:12.019 --> 00:22:15.514 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when we saw the
actual television footage

00:22:15.514 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:90%
of that stuff falling down--

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There she
goes, through feedback.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.457 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --we knew
right away what it was.

00:22:19.457 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.289 align:middle line:10%
That must've been astonishing.

00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: To find out first,
and maybe you can warn people

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.570 align:middle line:10%
or help people--

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, and that, of
course, is the challenge.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I had my own remote
viewing experience,

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:32.780 align:middle line:84%
had a similar
situation like this,

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:84%
although it was
more intentional.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
We had this mode of applying
remote viewing, which

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.650 align:middle line:90%
we called "open search."

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.983 align:middle line:84%
The idea was that you kind
of went out into the universe

00:22:40.983 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:84%
to see what was important
for the Department of Defense

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
to find out about, that may
happen in the next few days.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And usually it wasn't
hugely successful,

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:90%
but sometimes it was.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.125 align:middle line:84%
And so I, unbeknownst to me,
because of course I was not

00:22:53.125 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:84%
supposed to know what the target
was, we did an open search one

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.499 align:middle line:84%
day, went over to the
operations building,

00:22:57.499 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:90%
and the monitor sits down.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:84%
An old friend, Ed Dames, sits
down and says, OK, here's the--

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dr. Doom.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Dr, Doom, yeah.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And we start doing the
session, and my impression

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:84%
is-- I'm going to summarize
here very briefly,

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:84%
but I got the impression
of a warship sailing

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:84%
through a closed body of water
that was bounded on all sides

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.240 align:middle line:90%
by sand.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was at night, and
then off in the distance,

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:90%
there was this aircraft.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:24.090 align:middle line:84%
In the process of things--
I'm cutting a lot of detail--

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:84%
it dropped these tubular
things with little wings

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.785 align:middle line:84%
on it that made kind of
guttural roaring sounds.

00:23:28.785 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Torpedos.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they rushed,
sailed-- they flew around,

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.816 align:middle line:84%
and then somehow or other came
together with this warship.

00:23:34.816 --> 00:23:36.382 align:middle line:84%
And the warship--
smoke and flame,

00:23:36.382 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and it leans to one side,
and there's people yelling,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:84%
and there's fire hoses on
the deck, and all this stuff.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And the airplane
seemed to be based

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:84%
on the shore of
this body of water,

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.414 align:middle line:84%
and under control of people
in a-- I interpreted it

00:23:49.414 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
as a third-world city, because
it had a lot of flat roofs,

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.514 align:middle line:84%
kind of barren landscape,
domestic animals

00:23:54.514 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:84%
in the streets,
and the people who

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.679 align:middle line:84%
are controlling it
were military, but kind

00:23:57.679 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
of unprofessional in
the way they did things.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.138 align:middle line:84%
And Ed, at this point, who'd
been expecting something else,

00:24:02.138 --> 00:24:05.467 align:middle line:90%
he said, well, you're off.

00:24:05.467 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:90%
We'll just leave it there.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.716 align:middle line:84%
No one's right all
the time on this.

00:24:09.716 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:90%
And it was a weekend.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.798 align:middle line:90%
We went home for the weekend.

00:24:11.798 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And on Monday morning, I get
this call from Skip Atwater.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
He says, Paul, where's that
session you did on Friday?

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.621 align:middle line:84%
I said it's in my safe
drawer, but why do you care?

00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was off.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.661 align:middle line:84%
He said, you haven't looked
at the papers this morning,

00:24:24.661 --> 00:24:25.580 align:middle line:90%
have you?

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.160 align:middle line:84%
So I go open up The
Washington Post-- US destroyer

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:84%
hit by Exocet missile
in the Persian Gulf.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was exactly my remote
viewing session, exactly.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.100 align:middle line:90%
So that was great.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:90%
I wrote up a report.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
It went up-- I don't how far
up the channel, probably.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.721 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't by
surprised if it made it

00:24:42.721 --> 00:24:43.992 align:middle line:90%
to the Secretary of Defense.

00:24:43.992 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that the
Iranians who did that?

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It was the Iraqis--

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're right.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.758 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: --who we were
supposedly friends

00:24:48.758 --> 00:24:51.014 align:middle line:10%
with at the time.

00:24:51.014 --> 00:24:51.680 align:middle line:10%
They apologized.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.490 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They didn't
know it was our ship.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: It was a mistake.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.232 align:middle line:90%
And it may have been.

00:24:55.232 --> 00:24:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to judge the
geopolitics on this thing.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:84%
But whatever the case was,
it caused us to reflect,

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.800 align:middle line:90%
because we thought I was off.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So we just stuffed
it away in a drawer.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:90%
We didn't send it up the chain.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:90%
No one had the information.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.792 align:middle line:90%
They never acted on it.

00:25:12.792 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Could they have stopped the
situation from happening?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.895 align:middle line:90%
Probably.

00:25:15.895 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They would've
said, well, this

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:84%
matches a number of
settings around the world.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:20.566 align:middle line:84%
We'll just put
everybody on alert,

00:25:20.566 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and the ships would have its
air defense radars and stuff up.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:84%
The aircraft
would've detected it,

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:84%
probably wouldn't have fired,
and would've gone home, right?

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.970 align:middle line:84%
The ship was totally
really unprepared for it.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But then, of course, then that
event wouldn't have happened,

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.490 align:middle line:90%
and we would have been wrong.

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:35.954 align:middle line:84%
And so the next
time we said, well,

00:25:35.954 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be an event,
they'll say, oh, those guys.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:84%
They were wrong last time,
they're going to be wrong

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:40.867 align:middle line:90%
this time, too.

00:25:40.867 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe it
would have happened.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, we would
have prevented one event,

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
but very likely
something similar

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:84%
would have occurred in the
future, in spite of that.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
interesting ramifications

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.424 align:middle line:90%
to precognition as a tool.

00:25:55.424 --> 00:25:56.840 align:middle line:84%
There are some
ways it's valuable,

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.710 align:middle line:84%
in this ARV situation
I'm talking about,

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.310 align:middle line:90%
which is clearly precognition.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.434 align:middle line:84%
But there's other times when
I don't know how useful it is.

00:26:03.434 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some
people will say, why

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:90%
haven't we used remote viewing?

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't we use it to
find Osama bin Laden?

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:90%
And why didn't we do this?

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't we do that?

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.730 align:middle line:90%
How do you answer that?

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.005 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, first off,
how do you know we didn't?

00:26:15.005 --> 00:26:15.755 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We don't.

00:26:15.755 --> 00:26:16.350 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.377 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: We don't know that.

00:26:18.377 --> 00:26:20.960 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is that there
are some intelligence questions

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
that are very hard for
remote viewing to respond to.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Finding Osama bin Laden
was a good example.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And there were
remote viewers who

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.670 align:middle line:84%
tried to pinpoint
Osama bin Laden.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:84%
But the first problem
is they were not

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
military remote viewers, and
so getting that information

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.170 align:middle line:84%
into the system where anyone
would take it seriously--

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost impossible.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.046 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Almost impossible--
because there's so much

00:26:39.046 --> 00:26:39.730 align:middle line:90%
noise out there.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.246 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that is a psychic
or wants to be a psychic

00:26:42.246 --> 00:26:44.662 align:middle line:84%
is sending stuff in, and it
mostly ends up in the garbage,

00:26:44.662 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:84%
The second problem is,
though, that remote viewing,

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I think I mentioned, is a
descriptive methodology.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So you can't give
them lat/longs--

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.220 align:middle line:90%
latitude, longitude.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.955 align:middle line:84%
You can't give them
a street address.

00:26:56.955 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
All you can do is
describe the setting.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.316 align:middle line:84%
So a remote viewer
might say, oh, yeah.

00:27:00.316 --> 00:27:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I've got this guy
with a beard and he's

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:84%
sitting in this
long, funny room,

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.936 align:middle line:84%
and it's really long, really
narrow, rocky walls, carpet

00:27:05.936 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:84%
on the floor, and
guys with guns.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:84%
If you go outside
this room, you're

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:90%
in a bunch of barren mountains.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And the analyst is going to
say, that's exactly right.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:13.935 align:middle line:90%
Now where is he?

00:27:13.935 --> 00:27:16.476 align:middle line:84%
Well, the viewer's going to say,
you idiot, I just told you--

00:27:16.476 --> 00:27:16.757 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't know.

00:27:16.757 --> 00:27:17.715 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --where he is.

00:27:17.715 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:84%
He said he's in this room in
a bunch of barren mountains.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.190 align:middle line:90%
What more do you want to know?

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, so what I say is a
remote viewer can find things,

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.395 align:middle line:84%
but he can't
necessarily locate them.

00:27:29.395 --> 00:27:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:84%
If you see, in a remote
viewing, a car go by,

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and you spot the license
plate, and it says 2016 on it.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.230 align:middle line:90%
Does that work?

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Is that useful?

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, that
would be awesome

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.200 align:middle line:10%
if you could, but actually, no.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.741 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
happen like that.

00:27:45.741 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, remote
viewers rarely, if ever,

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.379 align:middle line:90%
can pick up numbers or letters.

00:27:49.379 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
obvious reason for that.

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or calendars.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Or
calendars, any of that

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.978 align:middle line:84%
stuff-- there's a very
obvious reason for that.

00:27:54.978 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of this
right brain, left brain split.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:84%
The right brain
is often optimized

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:84%
for description,
sensory experience,

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.027 align:middle line:90%
global holistic perception.

00:28:03.027 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The left brain is optimized
for linear approaches,

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.140 align:middle line:84%
like language, like writing,
like all that stuff.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.469 align:middle line:84%
And the left brain is also
the source of mental noise.

00:28:11.469 --> 00:28:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're trying to
get them working together,

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.125 align:middle line:90%
you run into trouble.

00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:16.458 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's almost impossible.

00:28:16.458 --> 00:28:17.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But what a tool,
what an amazing tool.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.860 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Within its parameters,
it is really, really useful.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So would you
recommend remote viewing

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.835 align:middle line:90%
to just about anybody?

00:28:29.835 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I would
recommend it to anyone

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.760 align:middle line:84%
who feels like they're
open-minded enough

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:90%
to deal with it.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.240 align:middle line:84%
There are people
who it freaks out.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are children good?

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Children-- there's an
interesting debate about this.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.841 align:middle line:84%
People think children would be
better because they have fewer

00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:45.580 align:middle line:84%
preconceived ideas about
the universe than adults do.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, they
also have less to work with.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.059 align:middle line:84%
You still need to have
a certain installed--

00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have--

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.387 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --knowldedge base.

00:28:51.387 --> 00:28:52.762 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --a
foundation of stuff.

00:28:52.762 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:55.860 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's a mixed bag.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.732 align:middle line:84%
I did get my kids
to-- I tried to get

00:28:58.732 --> 00:29:00.190 align:middle line:84%
them to dowse the
lottery when they

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:90%
were little under that premise.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.937 align:middle line:84%
So we would go over
to the ops building,

00:29:04.937 --> 00:29:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and I'd made this little
chart, and I'd tell them, OK, I

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.540 align:middle line:84%
want you dowse where the
Reese's Peanut Butter

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Cups are going to be tomorrow.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:15.486 align:middle line:84%
And they would put the Reese's
Cups they had on the squares

00:29:15.486 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:84%
where they thought
they would be.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And then if they were
right the next day,

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
they would get to keep the
ones they were right about.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.140 align:middle line:90%
The most we got right were four.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.650 align:middle line:90%
The most we got right were four.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:25.640 align:middle line:90%
But it was pretty good.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that would
have been in the money,

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.520 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't
understand the system.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dowsing works.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:90%
I've used it a lot.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a great tool.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.100 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's deep
within the psyche, I think.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's that tapping in
again, Paul, that works.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.780 align:middle line:84%
"Reading the Enemy's Mind"
with Paul Smith-- Paul,

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:84%
if people want more
information about you,

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:90%
what's the best place?

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.340 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, I suggest my
website, which is rviewer.com.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.650 align:middle line:10%
That's the letter R,
and the word viewer.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:10%
So R-V-I-E-W-E-R dot com.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does remote
viewing keep you healthier,

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.184 align:middle line:90%
in a state of mind, physically?

00:29:59.184 --> 00:30:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, more
research to be done,

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:04.400 align:middle line:84%
but my belief is that it
does, because first of all,

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.144 align:middle line:84%
it improves your
attitude about yourself.

00:30:06.144 --> 00:30:07.685 align:middle line:84%
It improves your
attitude about life.

00:30:07.685 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It improves your attitude and
understanding of the universe.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems kind
of depressing to me,

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:84%
if it were the case, that
all we are these, as I said,

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.076 align:middle line:84%
meat machines that live
for 70 years, and we die,

00:30:22.076 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's all there
is to us, right?

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But if that's the
way the universe is,

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.210 align:middle line:90%
you'd have to accept that.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:28.750 align:middle line:90%
But this is evidence it's not.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.360 align:middle line:10%
This is evidence
that actually we

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.110 align:middle line:10%
are more than that, that
we do have this ability

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.610 align:middle line:10%
to transcend the boundaries
of the physical universe,

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.460 align:middle line:10%
the boundaries of our physical
brains-- which is, I think,

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:10%
strong evidence
that we are more,

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.829 align:middle line:10%
that we are persisted
as entities, identities

00:30:44.829 --> 00:30:46.245 align:middle line:10%
that-- in other
words, essentially

00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about
life after death,

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:10%
a continuity of
human consciousness.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.494 align:middle line:84%
I think remote viewing is very
strong evidence for that, which

00:30:55.494 --> 00:30:57.660 align:middle line:84%
is maybe one of the reasons
why some scientists want

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.197 align:middle line:84%
to reject it is
because that messes

00:31:00.197 --> 00:31:01.530 align:middle line:90%
with their view of the universe.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.363 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to
upset the apple cart.

00:31:03.363 --> 00:31:05.055 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't
like to accept any

00:31:05.055 --> 00:31:07.320 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of the
evidence of ESP,

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.060 align:middle line:84%
because it does seem
to contradict what

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.875 align:middle line:84%
their models of the
universe predict.

00:31:11.875 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.405 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:31:14.405 --> 00:31:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You are welcome.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.346 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much, George.

00:31:16.346 --> 00:31:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul Smith,
remote viewer.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:10%
And you, that couple at home
watching the program right now,

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:10%
both of you in
those red sweaters?

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:10%
Take your feet off the table.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and this
has been "Beyond Belief."

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:45.667 align:middle line:90%
