00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:20.385 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome
back to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory with
another stunning episode.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
This episode we talk with
one of the foremost experts

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:10%
in ufology, Richard Dolan.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:84%
He's an investigator, a
historian, and by the way,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.202 align:middle line:84%
has his own television program
on Gaia called False Flags.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.535 align:middle line:90%
Richard, welcome to the program.

00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: Hi, George.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.713 align:middle line:84%
I'm very happy to
be on here with you.

00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's exciting talking
to you about all things UFOs

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
because you know your
subject matter as well

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.299 align:middle line:90%
as anybody in the world.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, thank you.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:10%
It's the most fascinating
subject that I can imagine.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:10%
And it has drawn me in now
for the last two plus decades.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And it has not
relinquished it's grip.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long already?

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, I'm always struck
by the great discrepancies,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:10%
is how I look at it, between
this massive UFO reality.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.256 align:middle line:84%
And it's every single day there
are sightings around the world.

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:10.671 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
mean that they're

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:84%
all alien craft, of course, but
there are interesting sightings

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet they get really
very little public attention

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and very little
official recognition

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:84%
by the United States government,
and really by most governments.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we get more
coverage back in the '50s

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:90%
than we do today?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's a good question.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.898 align:middle line:84%
I think, in a way,
yes, and in a way, no.

00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So in the '50s, when this was
all very new, back then, really

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.310 align:middle line:84%
newspapers were the main source
of information and media.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:90%
TV was just getting started.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.740 align:middle line:90%
There was radio.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And so newspapers and
radio did report a lot

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.360 align:middle line:84%
about UFOs, and
the flying saucers,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.376 align:middle line:90%
as they were called back then.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Then it kind of went
through a low period.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A laughter
period, actually.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.358 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, it really did.

00:01:56.358 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:84%
In the '70s and '80s, in
particular, I think it was low.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's picked up.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it has picked up
in the last 10 to 15 years.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:90%
I really credit the web.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:84%
I think the internet
has really done this.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And it has forced television
networks and major media

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
to get back into this, because
what they've discovered

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:84%
is people are
interested in this.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a passion
for this field, Richard.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.577 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I think I have
a passion for truth.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.118 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds
idealistic, but I really

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:90%
think that's what it is.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
interested in getting

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.690 align:middle line:84%
underneath the official
truth, the official

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:84%
established verities that
I'm supposed to believe.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
been of the opinion

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:84%
that there is something
behind the scenes.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I got into the
UFO subject years ago,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:84%
it became clear to
me that this was

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.330 align:middle line:84%
a reality that has
been taken seriously

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.862 align:middle line:84%
by very, very
prominent individuals

00:02:47.862 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
in the national
security community,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.577 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact that
all of the official word

00:02:52.577 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:90%
is that there's nothing to this.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:84%
It's all hoaxes, hallucinations,
misidentifications.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So when I found that there
was this great discrepancy--

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:84%
it's the way that I
am, I can't let go.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And I will continue
to try to pry that

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.969 align:middle line:90%
open to the best of my ability.

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
there's going to ever

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:90%
be government disclosure?

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.834 align:middle line:90%
Because I tell Steve Bassett no.

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: You don't think so?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
coming that way.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.843 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It depends on the day
of the week what I might think.

00:03:21.843 --> 00:03:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that we're
moving toward something.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:90%
I think our society is changing.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:84%
It has been changing
dramatically

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:90%
over the past number of decades.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.165 align:middle line:90%
And that won't stop.

00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
We have a much better
ability to communicate.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
We have a much better
ability to get information,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
even illegally at
times out of government

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:84%
through Wikileaks
and things like this.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're not in a stable
world in that sense.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:90%
And I think anything can happen.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that there
will be a voluntary government

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
disclosure of UFOs,
unless and until they

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.453 align:middle line:84%
are pushed to the wall
by some extreme event.

00:03:58.453 --> 00:03:59.286 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some event.

00:03:59.286 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Something happens.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.234 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Something,
a leak, a sighting,

00:04:01.234 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:90%
something that's not foreseen.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, no, I'm not
seeing it as very likely.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
The only possibility that
I could envision along

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:84%
a voluntary line would be,
maybe in a couple of decades,

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
if let's say there's
a kind of confidence

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.652 align:middle line:84%
that the US government has or
some other global government

00:04:26.652 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:84%
has that they could release
this and then control the spin,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.235 align:middle line:84%
control the narrative, if
they felt that they could

00:04:31.235 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:90%
do that, maybe they would.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that anyone's
in that position yet,

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.192 align:middle line:84%
even the US government,
which is the master of spin.

00:04:39.192 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
they are in a position

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.722 align:middle line:84%
to control the
narrative completely yet

00:04:42.722 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:84%
so I don't think that
they're willing to do it.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For a couple
decades, you've

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:84%
been pushing and striving
to get some answers.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But what does Richard Dolan
think about this phenomenon?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I think that
we are being visited,

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:84%
whether by visitors or
by long-term occupants,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:90%
whoever they are.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is
another intelligence that

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.170 align:middle line:84%
is behind at least the core
element of the UFO phenomenon,

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:90%
and they're not us.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.827 align:middle line:90%
They're not our civilization.

00:05:11.827 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they're
from another planet.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.035 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they're from
another dimension of reality

00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:17.629 align:middle line:90%
that we can't quite grasp.

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
They could very well
be from another world.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But I think that they're
not from our civilization

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:90%
and they've been monitoring us.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, it's all
speculation, George.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do they manipulate us?

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Do they watch us
in a benign way?

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Or do they think that
we're their property?

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:90%
These I don't know.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:84%
What I do believe,
though, strongly,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
is that governments
of the world,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
most predominantly the United
States government, but also

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:84%
many other governments, have
encounters with these objects.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.740 align:middle line:84%
They are important,
they are unexplainable

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:84%
in a conventional
way, and that there

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:90%
is secrecy relating to this.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I can
see, that the policy

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.474 align:middle line:84%
is to continue with that
secrecy as long as possible.

00:06:01.474 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
believe that there

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
are secret programs
between governments

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.152 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrials?

00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Again, I
don't know, but I

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
think that there are definitely
secret government programs that

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:90%
deal with this phenomenon.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there
are clandestine programs

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:84%
to study acquired
non-human technology, let's

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:90%
call it UFO crash retrievals.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:90%
I think that those exist.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are programs
to study non-human physiology

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:90%
and biology.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:84%
That is, let's
say, alien bodies.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:90%
I think those do exist.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:90%
I realize I don't have proof.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that
there's actually

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.150 align:middle line:84%
a surprisingly large body of
testimony over the decades that

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:90%
lead to that conclusion.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's my best bet.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there's a
clandestine black budget

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:84%
program that's
existing to study this.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Whether there is collaboration
with other intelligences,

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.397 align:middle line:84%
we have stories, we have
rumors, and we don't

00:07:00.397 --> 00:07:01.480 align:middle line:90%
have a lot more than that.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great stories.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: We have
interesting stories.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I am of the opinion
that sometimes we

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
would do better,
honestly, to hold off

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:84%
before jumping into some of
these stories that really

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
there's no way to confirm
them one way or another,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
or corroborate them
really, other than just

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:90%
what unverified people say.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.976 align:middle line:84%
And my dad, who was a
retired New York City cop,

00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:90%
really taught me, he said--

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He taught you
how to investigate.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: He said, look, he said
anyone can tell a good story.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can talk.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:84%
What you've got to do is you
have to look for evidence.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got
you into this field?

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: History.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I was working on
a PhD many years

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:90%
ago in US Cold War studies.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's always
been my life, is

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
politics, geopolitics, the
study of intelligence agencies.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And back then it
was all about 1948,

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
'49 US policy back then,
the CIA, the early Cold

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:90%
War, the Russians.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I stumbled
into the UFO field.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:10%
I read one of Tim Good's
books, "Above Top Secret:

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:10%
The Worldwide UFO Cover-Up."

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And that intrigued
me enough and I just

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.339 align:middle line:84%
became completely
sucked right in.

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've become
one of the top researchers

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:84%
of this field, Richard,
in a short time too.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I love what I do.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.639 align:middle line:84%
I try-- look, I
don't ever expect

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:90%
that I'll have all the answers.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't pretend that I
have all the answers.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:84%
But what I am is an
honest investigator

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
who I'm not afraid to
ask difficult questions.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid to
say I don't know.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But what I will say
is that we have enough

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of a body of evidence, confirmed
declassified documents,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:84%
for example, that do not
hint, they don't suggest,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:90%
but they do prove--

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.120 align:middle line:84%
they prove there is a
phenomenon, a UFO phenomenon

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that's real, that's important,
that's extraordinary,

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:84%
that's not easily explainable,
and that government military

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
agencies are very
concerned about.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
enough for a day's work.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don Schmitt's
book, "UFO Crash at Roswell"

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:84%
was turned into a
movie called "Roswell,"

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.582 align:middle line:84%
which highlights many of the
things that you do, Richard.

00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:02.382 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:02.382 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, let's just suppose
Los Alamos or White Sands

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.896 align:middle line:84%
launched some ultra experimental
plane, rocket, whatever.

00:09:12.896 --> 00:09:14.496 align:middle line:90%
>> They'd be out looking for it.

00:09:14.496 --> 00:09:15.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe they are.

00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:16.337 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they can't find it.

00:09:16.337 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:90%
That's happened.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Sherman, look around you.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.290 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what you
see geographically?

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
This place may be remote
by car, but not by plane.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.930 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to be blind not
to spot this from the air.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's found anything
because nobody's out looking.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:90%
And that means this ain't ours.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gosh, Richard, they're
hiding something from us,

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: That was an
interesting scene.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't watched
that in a while.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I think that they,
government agencies, military,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
are indeed hiding things,
and it's important for them.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.650 align:middle line:84%
For years, and years, and years,
through the '40s, and '50s,

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and '60s, and '70s, the Air
Force and all the government

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:84%
agencies said, we have
nothing to do with UFOs.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:90%
We had Project Blue Book.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:03.780 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And then came the Freedom
of Information Act

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
in the late '70s,
where researchers

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
had access to petition the
government for documents

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:90%
on UFOs.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, thousands of
pages of documents on UFOs

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:90%
were released.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A flurry of them.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.945 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Quite a few.

00:10:17.945 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And so no single smoking
gun saying, oh, yes, they're

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.700 align:middle line:84%
all extraterrestrial,
but a lot of smoking guns

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
proving strong interest
by the FBI, the CIA,

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:84%
by all the military agencies,
and many, many others,

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:84%
proving that they
are very concerned,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and also indicating a lot
of military encounters

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
with these UFOs that are
really not explainable,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, pilots seeing
disk-shaped objects,

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
white disk-shaped objects
pass by their plane

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:52.171 align:middle line:84%
that cause a bump when the
air bumps into the plane.

00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And these are described
in military report

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and are tracked on radar
simultaneously at times.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So this happened
again and again,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and clearly, it's enough for
them to take it seriously.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is amazing.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.625 align:middle line:84%
In some of the cases that you've
investigated and looked at too,

00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:84%
the Socorro, New Mexico
Lonnie Zamora case,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
for example, where he saw
a craft land in the desert

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
with little occupants
running around.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, originally when
I heard that story,

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking to myself, he's
looking at the lunar Lander

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:90%
and they're doing the test.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Right, that's a very,
I think, logical supposition.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
But there's no reason
to think that this

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.550 align:middle line:90%
is the case whatsoever.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I have not seen any
evidence to that effect at all.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:84%
But what Zamora did
say-- he was a police

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:84%
officer-- he saw an object that
appeared to crash over a hill.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.370 align:middle line:84%
He pulled over, ran
up the hill, and saw

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
what he thought was
an overturned vehicle

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:90%
and children.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And when he got close enough,
he realized that those did not

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:90%
look like children.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They weren't kids.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Lonnie Zamora
got very frightened,

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.370 align:middle line:84%
ran, and then came back
eventually, by which time

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:84%
the craft had taken off
and was flying away.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love those stories.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.401 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: There's a lot of
follow-up to that, of course.

00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:90%
This is 1964.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.740 align:middle line:90%
This is 50 plus years ago.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.710 align:middle line:90%
And the FBI was there.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:90%
The Air Force was there.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.175 align:middle line:84%
A lot of other private
civilian agencies

00:12:17.175 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:90%
were also there investigating.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:90%
There were soil samples taken.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Very famously, there
were some rocks

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:84%
that had samples from the
object as it had taken off

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.345 align:middle line:84%
that were taken to
a lab in Maryland,

00:12:30.345 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:84%
the Goddard facility
in Maryland.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.037 align:middle line:84%
And it was scraped clean
and never shown again.

00:12:37.037 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they know
what it is and where it is.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, I think so.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And that's just
one of countless stories.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the stories
of landings of objects,

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
even in the 1950s,
one at Minot Air Force

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Base in North Dakota where a
team saw an object coming down.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:90%
It was tracked by NORAD.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was visible to
a sabotage alert team

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:90%
that was vectored in there.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.775 align:middle line:84%
And they saw it and it
disrupted their communications,

00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:08.700 align:middle line:90%
their radio.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
All of this is in
a 1966 document

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.395 align:middle line:84%
that was released through
Freedom of Information.

00:13:13.395 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And more and more,
it just keeps going.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.395 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
Richard, the close

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
encounters stories of the
past seem to be gone now.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't seem to be getting
those kinds of cases anymore.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I wonder.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where are they going?

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, I don't
know if that's the case.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I hear people saying this,
but there are still abduction

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:90%
researchers out there.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.607 align:middle line:84%
There are still individuals who
will interview other people who

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:90%
have had encounters.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you remember the
stories of the landing pods.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And you'd see burned out
areas where something landed,

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.519 align:middle line:84%
clearly impressions
of tripod legs.

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't get that kind
of evidence anymore.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.185 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's true.

00:13:50.185 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:90%
There's not as many.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Like in 1978, for
example, a long time

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:84%
ago, someone dubbed it
the year of the humanoid

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:84%
because there were so many
sightings of beings that year.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And really we're not
getting those types anymore.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what it is.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.324 align:middle line:84%
Was this a mass
psychosis and we're not

00:14:11.324 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:90%
having that psychosis?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Or is it that they themselves
have changed their procedures

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're not allowing
themselves to be

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.910 align:middle line:90%
seen as readily by us anymore?

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Those types of landing reports
are not coming in the way

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:84%
There are other reports
that do come in.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:90%
There are still the triangles.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:90%
There's still spheres.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:90%
There's still the dots.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:10%
It has to be said, though, like
we're getting better and better

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.810 align:middle line:10%
at identifying a lot
of these UFOs reports.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So when there are good
competent investigators doing

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
the investigations,
that number of unknowns

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:90%
does appear to be going down.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the very
excellent researcher Chris

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Rutkowski up in Canada,
in Winnipeg, every year

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:84%
releases Canadian
statistics relating to UFOs.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And it really does
look like the unknowns

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
that he is releasing, the more
that they are investigating,

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.804 align:middle line:84%
the more contemporary
the reports are,

00:15:16.804 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:90%
the lower the percentage is.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So they're down to
like 1.5% unknowns.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Richard, I am
obsessed with the Old Testament

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:90%
and Genesis.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you read
it, as I've read it

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:36.010 align:middle line:84%
many times, as a kid I took
the biblical perspective of it,

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
angels, god, things like
that, now when I read it,

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:84%
it clearly shows
extraterrestrial visitation

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and presence.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: There's a lot in the
Old Testament in the Bible

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that is very suggestive,
I think without a doubt.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's really true, like it
depends on the perspective you

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:90%
have when you're reading these.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at it
with a view to asking

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:84%
is there evidence that some
of these angelic sightings,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:84%
for example, could be
interpreted differently,

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:84%
then suddenly you
can see that there

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.030 align:middle line:84%
are other ways of
interpreting these stories.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm very open to
the fact that that

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.122 align:middle line:84%
may in fact be something
to do with what

00:16:19.122 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:90%
we call ancient aliens.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.595 align:middle line:90%
But I don't really know, George.

00:16:22.595 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, but it's
great reading, Richard.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: It's great reading.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.250 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
All ancient cultures, not
just the ancient Hebrews,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:84%
but the Nordics, and
the Vedic tradition

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:84%
in the Indian subcontinent
and in the Western hemisphere,

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.240 align:middle line:84%
they all have ancient
stories of the gods,

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:84%
who come from the skies
or come from the oceans.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you really start
analyzing them carefully,

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:49.780 align:middle line:84%
you can ask yourself, well, gee,
who are these beings really?

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really know if we'll
ever really get to a point.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm fascinated
by the Wandjina

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.230 align:middle line:84%
in Australia, those
cave paintings.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yes.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Where you see these
paintings of beings that are

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:90%
5,000-year-old paintings.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.342 align:middle line:90%
And they look like gray aliens.

00:17:05.342 --> 00:17:06.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they really truly do.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.041 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would make
that up 5,000 years ago?

00:17:10.041 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: So what does it mean?

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.260 align:middle line:90%
This I don't know.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:84%
The Wandjina, just
to continue that,

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.740 align:middle line:84%
are said by the Aborigines to
have come from the Milky Way.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Or one of them actually
created, I think,

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:90%
the Milky Way in their culture.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's this connection
with space with them as well.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:90%
So that's even more intriguing.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:90%
So we have hints.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:84%
We have these suggestive
things to look at.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm fascinated by that.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm more interested
as a researcher

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.964 align:middle line:84%
in the contemporary stuff, in
the government connections.

00:17:39.964 --> 00:17:41.380 align:middle line:84%
That's always
what's motivated me,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.200 align:middle line:84%
because when I look at the
government connections,

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:90%
I have tangible evidence.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:90%
I have documents.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I have proof that
government agencies

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:84%
are interested in
this phenomenon,

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that they keep saying they're
not interested in them.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That doesn't exist
as far as their concerned.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Exactly.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So to me, that's my
angle of approach.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Vatican
fascinates me as well.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:90%
They've got two observatories.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:90%
They're into science.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of their head
astronomers talked about some

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:90%
of these cases.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with that.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that the nature of the
political realities that we

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:84%
are in and have been
in for a long time

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
preclude it, unless there
is a great accident.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.956 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure, I wrote
a book on this.

00:20:59.956 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It was called
"After Disclosure."

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:06.530 align:middle line:10%
And to me, it's the great
disruptor of the modern world.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.460 align:middle line:84%
It really disrupts everything,
not simply our politics,

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:90%
but our energy paradigm.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:84%
All of the institutional
power that exists in our world

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:84%
will be disrupted
by a UFO disclosure.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
There's too many people who
have too much to lose by it.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I've never
seen a motivation

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:90%
for political leaders to do it.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.875 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, I've
never seen evidence

00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that our political leaders
are anything other than window

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.309 align:middle line:84%
dressing for power
that sits behind them.

00:21:33.309 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they don't
even know what's going on.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right, exactly.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I think most of
them don't really

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:84%
know what's going on, other
than in their own little narrow,

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:90%
dealing with their constituents.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe
that disclosure

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:84%
is about to happen anytime
in the immediate future.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are in an
unstable situation.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.560 align:middle line:90%
There's always instabilities.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:10%
We have a new
administration, and there's

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.000 align:middle line:10%
a lot that's unpredictable.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So in situations where there
are unpredictabilities,

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:84%
we have to keep in mind
that things can happen.

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.350 align:middle line:84%
There is evidence, or
at least let me say,

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:84%
there's reason to
believe that there's

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.057 align:middle line:84%
a kind of subterranean
power struggle going

00:22:13.057 --> 00:22:14.515 align:middle line:84%
on in various places
in Washington.

00:22:14.515 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A deep one.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And in what we
will call the deep state.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.260 align:middle line:90%
And in that type of--

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.635 align:middle line:84%
I mean, after all,
there's leaks.

00:22:20.635 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:90%
There's Wikileaks.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.600 align:middle line:90%
There's NSA leaks happening.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.680 align:middle line:90%
There's CIA leaks.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:90%
All of this is going on now.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, in that
type of a situation,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:84%
my reasoning is that
anything could be possible.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.752 align:middle line:84%
So we can look for it, but that
would not be government policy.

00:22:36.752 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:90%
That would be an inside leak.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.745 align:middle line:90%
And that would be unexpected.

00:22:38.745 --> 00:22:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And if
that were to happen,

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I think what's interesting then
would be the level of spin that

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:84%
would be taken by a government
agency, US or other,

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:84%
to maintain control
over the leak.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And the way I look
at it is this,

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
like within the black budget
world, the classified world,

00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
there is this mountain of UFO
data that I assume they have.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, we've gotten
glimmers of it over the years

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:90%
through Freedom of Information.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John Greenewald
has done a great job digging

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.610 align:middle line:90%
that out.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.443 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely.

00:23:07.443 --> 00:23:09.256 align:middle line:90%
So there's a tremendous amount.

00:23:09.256 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably
a great deal

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:90%
that remains very classified.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.792 align:middle line:84%
So if a government
wanted to disclose that,

00:23:16.792 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me that
they could just

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.080 align:middle line:84%
take a sliver, a little
sliver of that mountain

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and put that out, and
package it in such a way

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.219 align:middle line:84%
that it would serve
their interests.

00:23:27.219 --> 00:23:28.510 align:middle line:90%
What might that sliver include?

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it could
include things like,

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:84%
hey, these aliens are
a little bit scary,

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:84%
but we're here doing
our best to protect you.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.129 align:middle line:84%
What we've done
may seem illegal,

00:23:37.129 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:84%
but we've really done it
in the public interests.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Like it would be
easy for them to spin

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:90%
a disclosure in that way.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.170 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, I'm doing a
lot of research on false flags

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.150 align:middle line:84%
People have talked about
the famous Project Blue Beam

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:90%
as a potential UFO false flag.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.875 align:middle line:90%
I've never believed--

00:23:54.875 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And explain that.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Explain what Blue
Beam is to people.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, I've never
believed in Blue Beam.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:02.980 align:middle line:84%
But Blue Beam is the idea of
a fake alien invasion that

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.996 align:middle line:84%
would frighten
people into running

00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:84%
to the government
for protection.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Help us, please.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So I've never believed
in that scenario.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe in the
potential of disclosure

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:90%
itself being a false flag.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So that, in other
words, the government--

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.880 align:middle line:84%
because the best
way to keep a secret

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:90%
is to pretend to share it.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:84%
You give up a little
sliver of that secret

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and then tell the world,
oh, yes, well, this

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:90%
is a little bit true.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you're withholding
all of this other evidence.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.641 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But speaking
of governments,

00:24:33.641 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
will we get disclosure
from some other country?

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:90%
It might not come from Russia.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:90%
It might not come from China.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it will come from
Brazil or some other place.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: It's a great question.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Most of the nations of
the world are pretty

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:90%
much under the US system.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:90%
So in other words--

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
there's 200 sovereign
nations on Earth, roughly.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Of those 200, let's say
30, maybe 40 of them

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:90%
have significant militaries.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most military
spending in the world

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.477 align:middle line:84%
is dominated by
really the top 10

00:25:09.477 --> 00:25:11.310 align:middle line:84%
countries, which I think
account for like 80

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:90%
plus percent of it all.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
But let's include the
next 20 or 30 after them.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.331 align:middle line:84%
And they're really the ones
that have an infrastructure.

00:25:18.331 --> 00:25:19.830 align:middle line:84%
They have an
intelligence community.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:84%
They've got
sophisticated ability

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:84%
to monitor and maybe
gather information.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Of that top 30 nations,
nearly all of them

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:32.084 align:middle line:84%
are integrated into the US
national security system.

00:25:32.084 --> 00:25:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
Britain, there's France,

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:37.170 align:middle line:84%
there's even Brazil is
very closely integrated.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.580 align:middle line:84%
The ones that are
not are Russia.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.538 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Japan is huge.

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Japan,
absolutely-- Germany.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that are
outside the US systems

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.070 align:middle line:90%
are the really interesting ones.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't see Brazil,
for example, doing it.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:53.610 align:middle line:84%
To use Brazil as an example,
we learned through the Snowden

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:84%
revelations a
couple of years ago

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that the phone of then
president Dilma Rousseff

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:84%
was totally
monitored by the NSA.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And we learned that all of
her ministers were monitored.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you were
going to disclose,

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.230 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to be
very, very careful

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
because the NSA would know
every single thing you're

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.260 align:middle line:90%
about to do.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.093 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:10.093 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So but now, Russia is
not part of that, China is not,

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Iran is not, North Korea
is not, Syria is not.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain number of
governments that are outside

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.410 align:middle line:90%
of the US sphere of influence.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And to me, those are the ones
that I would be looking for.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:84%
If there was going to be a
nation that would jump out

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.150 align:middle line:84%
in front of the
United States, that

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.920 align:middle line:84%
would be my bet--
maybe like Russia.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The former

It's great to have you

And as a matter of fact,
they've been visiting our planet

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.002 align:middle line:10%
for thousands of years.

00:27:23.002 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:10%
And one of the cases that
would interest you most,

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:10%
if you'll give me two or
three minutes to answer,

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:10%
is during the Cold
War, 1961, there

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:37.820 align:middle line:10%
were about 50 UFOs in formation
flying south from Russia

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:10%
across Europe.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:10%
And the Supreme Allied
Commander was very concerned

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.265 align:middle line:10%
and about ready
to press the panic

00:27:46.265 --> 00:27:48.140 align:middle line:10%
button, when they turned
around and went back

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:10%
over the North Pole.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.135 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love how Paul said
give me two or four minutes

00:27:52.135 --> 00:27:53.426 align:middle line:90%
to talk about this specifically

00:27:53.426 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, right.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He is into this.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.884 align:middle line:90%
And he's into it in a big way.

00:27:56.884 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's either
a liar or this guy

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.301 align:middle line:90%
is really telling the truth.

00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:90%
There's no middle ground here.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.258 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, he's
certainly not a liar.

00:28:06.258 --> 00:28:08.000 align:middle line:90%
I also know Paul.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a great
deal of integrity.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And he's done a lot of research
into this subject, as well as

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:84%
many, many other
people have done.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.912 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
important that we

00:28:20.912 --> 00:28:23.370 align:middle line:84%
have someone of his stature
who is willing to go out there.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that was
a very good interview

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:84%
he gave with Sophie
Shevardnadze.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And we need to get more
prominent individuals.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He may be the highest
level of government official

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:90%
that has gone public like this.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: He is.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:84%
There was actually a
minister of defense of France

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:46.220 align:middle line:84%
back in the '70s, a man
named Robert Galley,

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.335 align:middle line:84%
who gave an interview,
not nearly as prominently.

00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:51.110 align:middle line:90%
That was Paul Hellyer.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And there has been a few
other prominent generals

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.705 align:middle line:90%
and senior personnel.

00:28:55.705 --> 00:28:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But I think you're
right, I think

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.705 align:middle line:84%
Paul Hellyer is
probably the number one

00:28:58.705 --> 00:29:00.650 align:middle line:84%
prominent former
government official.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Richard, is
secrecy a good thing?

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.557 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.557 --> 00:29:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, it's complicated.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I can sympathize with
those secret keepers who,

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.574 align:middle line:84%
particularly back in the
1940s, had been looking

00:29:14.574 --> 00:29:16.490 align:middle line:84%
at a phenomenon that
they wouldn't really know

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.170 align:middle line:90%
how to explain to the public.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.530 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't really know are
we dealing with friend or foe.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And assuming that they
acquired exotic technology,

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.620 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't want to share
it with the rest of the world.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.786 align:middle line:90%
It would be very disruptive.

00:29:28.786 --> 00:29:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's not hard, really,
to see why they would

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.290 align:middle line:90%
institute a policy of secrecy.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think you could
make a very good argument

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.820 align:middle line:90%
for them initiating that.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The problem with secrecy
is that it develops

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:84%
its own power, its own
momentum, its own profitability,

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:48.540 align:middle line:84%
its own reason to be, and it
takes on a life of its own.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.790 align:middle line:84%
I believe that over the
course of now a human lifetime

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.250 align:middle line:84%
that we've had since
this all started

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that the secrecy
has been destructive

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.250 align:middle line:90%
to our civilization.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.860 align:middle line:90%
I think its kind of eaten away.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
created distrust too.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: It absolutely has.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:04.133 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Massive distrust.

00:30:04.133 --> 00:30:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And a kind of
mass cognitive dissonance,

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.075 align:middle line:84%
in the sense where
people around the world,

00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:84%
we know that there's
something going on here,

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:14.533 align:middle line:84%
and yet we're told
over and over again

00:30:14.533 --> 00:30:15.920 align:middle line:90%
that there's nothing going on.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't learn to
trust our own instincts,

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.880 align:middle line:84%
our own ability to
figure things out.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's been
unhealthy for us.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.194 align:middle line:84%
And I also think the
evidence points to the fact

00:30:27.194 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that there are
certain groups that

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:90%
are profiting by this secrecy.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.481 align:middle line:84%
And so they're using it
for their own benefit.

00:30:33.481 --> 00:30:35.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you
access to this knowledge,

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.750 align:middle line:84%
this technology, you can
make money off of it.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.610 align:middle line:84%
You can segue it into
private industry,

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.710 align:middle line:84%
get great ground floor
investment opportunities,

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:90%
and who knows what else.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like holding the
future in your hands.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think in that sense
it's been destructive.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I have
to side with truth.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I have to side with the
necessity for humans

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.570 align:middle line:84%
to have access to what is
true, as opposed to being kind

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:90%
of living in a fantasy land.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that's
good for us as a species,

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.690 align:middle line:84%
as a civilization, to be kept
in this sort of illusion year

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.670 align:middle line:84%
after year with our
future being held hostage.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.128 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are some, Corey
Goode being one of them, who

00:31:13.128 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:84%
believes indeed there
is a secret space

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:90%
program under foot.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't explain all
the extraterrestrial craft

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.220 align:middle line:90%
and what they might be.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.340 align:middle line:84%
But do you think a
lot of people who

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.730 align:middle line:84%
are seeing objects are seeing
advanced technology that we

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:29.810 align:middle line:90%
have?

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, I've been
arguing for many years

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:84%
that I think that
there is a secret space

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.697 align:middle line:90%
program for quite a while.

00:31:37.697 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:90%
That's been my conclusion.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't base that on any
of the contemporary individuals

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.440 align:middle line:90%
who are making claims.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:84%
But I do base it on earlier
whistleblowers, people

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.880 align:middle line:84%
like Karl Wolf or Donna Hare,
for example, who go back

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.900 align:middle line:84%
to the 1960s and '70s, and
those types of individuals

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:84%
who I think are very credible
and talk about the likelihood,

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:84%
or their evidence for
bases on the moon,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.460 align:middle line:84%
for an alien presence
in outer space,

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and for our own
secret space program

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.380 align:middle line:90%
to deal with that reality.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't really have a
judgment one way or the other

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.260 align:middle line:84%
on some of the contemporary
whistleblowers.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, I think, are more
and less credible than others.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I should
just leave it at that.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late Wernher
von Braun's secretary

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.520 align:middle line:84%
talked about things
that he knew as well.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.312 align:middle line:90%
Do you think he was--

00:32:32.312 --> 00:32:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, these are the
statements of Dr. Carol Rosin,

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:38.530 align:middle line:84%
who was von Braun's secretary
during his final years--

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.140 align:middle line:84%
of course, von Braun,
the great rocket

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.770 align:middle line:84%
scientist from
Paperclip, from the Nazis

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.020 align:middle line:90%
and brought over to NASA.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.560 align:middle line:90%
She claimed-- and I believe her.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I completely believe Carol--

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.380 align:middle line:84%
that in his last years he
said to her, this is real,

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and that in fact, this being
an extraterrestrial reality,

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and that at some
point there would

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:08.060 align:middle line:84%
be a kind of false, almost like
a false flag, of the government

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:13.700 align:middle line:84%
frightening the public that
the aliens were hostile.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I have no reason to think that
that's anything other than what

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:90%
she said.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Whether von Braun
himself was saying this

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:84%
because he was briefed or
because he was giving her

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.040 align:middle line:90%
his opinion, this I don't know.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's no question
that when one scratches

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.700 align:middle line:84%
the surface of our national
security community,

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.220 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking NASA,
whether we're talking the CIA,

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.990 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking
any of these groups,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:43.070 align:middle line:84%
we find people who have had
access to information, who

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.810 align:middle line:84%
indeed some of them
have been briefed

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:48.230 align:middle line:84%
on the reality of
the UFO phenomenon.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with a gentleman,
a very high level gentleman

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:56.030 align:middle line:84%
formerly with CIA who
knows multiple former US

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.280 align:middle line:84%
presidents and former
heads of the CIA,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and secretaries of
defense, and he knows them

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.120 align:middle line:90%
on a personal basis.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, I
asked him one time,

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.400 align:middle line:90%
how much do presidents know?

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.425 align:middle line:84%
The question anyone
would want to ask.

00:34:10.425 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:84%
We had a couple of
these conversations.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And at one point
he said, well, some

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.725 align:middle line:90%
have known more than others.

00:34:14.725 --> 00:34:16.909 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look, some
presidents are considered

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:19.489 align:middle line:90%
reliable, others are not.

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:21.409 align:middle line:90%
He said presidents come and go.

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.230 align:middle line:84%
The lifers, though,
they're here to stay.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're here to stay.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And so
he gave me reason

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.540 align:middle line:84%
to think that not all of them
are equally briefed fully

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.440 align:middle line:90%
on the subject.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing he said to
me was that in his retirement,

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.380 align:middle line:84%
he's had conversations,
he said to me

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:41.389 align:middle line:84%
with 16 former
presidents, CIA directors,

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.909 align:middle line:84%
secretaries of defense,
and assistant secretaries,

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.560 align:middle line:90%
or undersecretaries of defense.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So 18 of those people,
top level at the pyramid.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.965 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and we had
conversations about UFO/ET.

00:34:53.965 --> 00:34:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love this.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: And he said, oh god.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.627 align:middle line:84%
So he said those exact
words, two or three.

00:34:59.627 --> 00:35:00.460 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't say two.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.376 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't say three.

00:35:01.376 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:90%
He said two or three.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I said to him, oh,
what are you wasting

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.387 align:middle line:90%
your time with that nonsense?

00:35:07.387 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't waste your time with that.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But the others.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Then he said three
or four said, oh, yes, UFOs, I

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.530 align:middle line:84%
was briefed on that, and
they did some note sharing

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:90%
apparently.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but the vast
majority, like more than eight

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:84%
or nine of them said, oh, UFOs,
what do you know about that?

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I have been trying to
get information on that

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and I can't get anything.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.441 align:middle line:84%
So I said, it sounds to
me like in some ways,

00:35:38.441 --> 00:35:39.940 align:middle line:84%
they're at the top
of the food chain

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and yet they're
not being briefed.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.820 align:middle line:90%
So who's above them?

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I will
ask the question.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I said, are we talking like
the Bilderbergers, someone

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:84%
behind the president,
essentially?

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, that's
been my assumption.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of
those who I think

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
knew something was the late
President Ronald Reagan.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And when he talked before
the United Nations,

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.120 align:middle line:90%
he was very compelling.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.820 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>> In our obsession with
antagonisms of the moment.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:84%
We often forget how much unites
all the members of humanity.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we need some
outside universal threat

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.300 align:middle line:84%
to make us recognize
this common bond.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:10%
I occasionally think how quickly
our differences worldwide

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:10%
would vanish if we were
facing an alien threat

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.450 align:middle line:10%
from outside this world.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet I ask you, is not an
alien force already among us?

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:42.510 align:middle line:84%
What could be more alien to
the universal aspirations

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.840 align:middle line:84%
of our peoples than war
and the threat of war?

[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
he know, Richard?

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, his
script, he called

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:52.991 align:middle line:84%
it his fantasy to
his script writers,

00:36:52.991 --> 00:36:55.590 align:middle line:84%
because he would bring this
up over and over again.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they wanted it out.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right, exactly.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.930 align:middle line:90%
They hated this.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But Ronald Reagan
was interested.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.600 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Ronald
Reagan had a UFO

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.200 align:middle line:84%
sighting as governor of
California back in 1974.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is no question
about this whatsoever.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:90%
We now know this.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.460 align:middle line:90%
He was doing a campaign.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.980 align:middle line:84%
He was in a little Cessna with
his pilot and one other person.

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It came right by him.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Exactly.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
thing about Reagan,

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.110 align:middle line:84%
this white object
descends from the sky

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and Reagan says to his
pilot, let's go after it!

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And the pilot's name was
Bill Payntor, P-A-Y-N-T-O-R.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And but of course, they had
no way to go after this thing.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.990 align:middle line:90%
It just took off.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's gone.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Reagan was very
excited about this sighting.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And he talked briefly about
it and then realized maybe I'd

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:42.480 align:middle line:90%
better not talk about this.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually
one other Reagan UFO

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.460 align:middle line:84%
story that I've
heard about, in fact,

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I got from the actress
Shirley MacLaine.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.114 align:middle line:84%
And this is a story that went
through the Hollywood circles.

00:37:53.114 --> 00:37:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Shirley's
into this in a big way.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And the story that was, that has
circulated in Hollywood, back

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:04.080 align:middle line:84%
in those days was that Ron
and Nancy arrived very late

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.054 align:middle line:84%
at a party, I believe
it was for Lucille Ball.

00:38:06.054 --> 00:38:06.970 align:middle line:90%
They arrive very late.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:12.150 align:middle line:84%
They were ashen from putting
the pieces together, supposedly.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.210 align:middle line:84%
They had had their own
encounter with an object

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:16.600 align:middle line:90%
off the side of the road.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Fill in the blanks.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So if that's true
this is a president

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.620 align:middle line:84%
who's had his own definite
interests and experiences.

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And yes, he was clearly
interested in the UFO subject

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:29.800 align:middle line:90%
as president.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.341 align:middle line:84%
But of course, when
you're president,

00:38:31.341 --> 00:38:34.512 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go kind
of on the down low.

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and also, people
think that as the president

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
information and you're going

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.630 align:middle line:90%
to be privy to certain things.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's not always the case.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Everyone thinks that
new administrations

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.790 align:middle line:84%
will become the disclosure
of administration.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh god, I know.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I still don't think
that's going to happen.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think presidents
are briefed for some reason.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, everyone's got
different opinions on this.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are researchers
who absolutely are convinced

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.900 align:middle line:90%
that they do get briefed.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm kind of with you.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:07.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that presidents do
not necessarily get briefed.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think as we
move forward into the future,

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.629 align:middle line:84%
they are less and less
likely to be briefed,

00:39:12.629 --> 00:39:14.170 align:middle line:84%
because what we
really have is a kind

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.710 align:middle line:84%
of a runaway national
security state.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm very glad that I titled my
first two volumes of history

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.680 align:middle line:84%
"UFOs and the National
Security State" because I

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.210 align:middle line:84%
think we have a runaway national
security apparatus globally.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And now people are
calling it the deep state.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Same thing, really--

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in a runaway
situation where presidents,

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.522 align:middle line:84%
I think, increasingly
are just there for show.

00:39:38.522 --> 00:39:39.730 align:middle line:90%
They have to kiss the babies.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.021 align:middle line:84%
They've got to talk
to the TV cameras.

00:39:42.021 --> 00:39:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And they've got to keep
everything running along

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.186 align:middle line:90%
the way it's supposed to go.

00:39:45.186 --> 00:39:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And when they don't, well,
then they can be removed.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion,
in your lifetime,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.132 align:middle line:84%
will Richard Dolan
get disclosure?

00:39:55.132 --> 00:39:56.590 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Well, if
I get disclosure,

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.330 align:middle line:10%
the world gets
disclosure because I'm

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.410 align:middle line:10%
no different from anybody else.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.610 align:middle line:10%
My own analysis--

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.740 align:middle line:10%
I think I've got a very
strong analysis that

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:10%
says this is a real phenomenon.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.370 align:middle line:90%
UFOs are real.

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.400 align:middle line:84%
There is another
presence that is here.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't really need any
more convincing on that.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Whether we will get
disclosure in our lifetime,

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.740 align:middle line:84%
whether we will see
it, I don't know.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:24.280 align:middle line:90%
I think we're now in 2017.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Gosh, the years just fly by.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's going fast, kid.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It could
happen in a decade.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:35.645 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is this, if it
were to happen within a decade,

00:40:35.645 --> 00:40:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
it would necessarily

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.190 align:middle line:90%
be a truthful disclosure.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.840 align:middle line:84%
As I was saying
before, I think it

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.770 align:middle line:84%
could be a sliver of a
disclosure, a manipulated kind

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.570 align:middle line:90%
of processed disclosure.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Just like a Milky Way candy
bar is processed food, but not

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.339 align:middle line:84%
real food, it's very
possible we could be getting

00:40:54.339 --> 00:40:55.505 align:middle line:90%
a very processed disclosure.

00:40:55.505 --> 00:40:57.230 align:middle line:90%
So we've got to be careful.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:59.605 align:middle line:84%
I think if there
is a disclosure,

00:40:59.605 --> 00:41:02.690 align:middle line:84%
if there is an acknowledgement
of this reality,

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:84%
we researchers need to be very,
very on top of that statement

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and do some serious
fact-checking,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that
the disclosure is

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:17.011 align:middle line:84%
truthful and honest
and not manipulative

00:41:17.011 --> 00:41:18.760 align:middle line:84%
in one way or another,
which I think would

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.214 align:middle line:90%
be the most likely outcome.

>>DOLAN: Me too.

>>NOORY: Because we deserve it.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.740 align:middle line:90%
We have a right to know.

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.200 align:middle line:90%
And I think it will happen.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.320 align:middle line:10%
It won't come, in my
opinion, from governments,

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:10%
but it'll come from people like
Richard Dolan who go out there

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.340 align:middle line:10%
and get this job done for us.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:42.733 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for
watching Beyond Belief.
