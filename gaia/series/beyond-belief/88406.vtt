00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.898 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:11.125 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:13.444 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.394 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.394 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Well, welcome back

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:10%
to another edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
we're still talking now

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:10%
about the possibility
of the power grid

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.350 align:middle line:10%
going down because of an
EMP attack or an X-flare.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:84%
In our most recent
"Beyond Belief" program,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle line:84%
we talked about an EMP
attack from some nation

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:84%
or a rogue nation that detonates
a nuke in the atmosphere

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and completely wipes
out the power system.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But what about an
X-flare from the sun?

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Say it can't happen?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.210 align:middle line:90%
It's happened several times.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
In the 1800s, it's called
the Carrington Event.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:84%
It knocked out the
telegraph system.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Thank God we didn't have a
lot of power and electricity

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:90%
in those days.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And just two years ago, the
sun unleashed a huge X-flare

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:84%
that fortunately went
off the side of the sun.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Had it been facing
directly to good ol' planet

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Earth-- Michael Maloof,
author of "A Nation Forsaken."

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most important
books I've ever read.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL MALOOF: Thank you.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would
have been a disaster.

00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:27.439 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: It would have
been a total disaster

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:10%
if we had a direct hit.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:10%
Even though-- and NASA said
that even though it missed us,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:10%
there were still some
residual effects,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:10%
some communication
systems did go out.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.885 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Crackling.

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:10%
I heard crackling on my show.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.795 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: It was crackling.

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:10%
There was crackling, and
some systems went out.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:10%
Planes were diverted
from over the North Pole

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:10%
because your North
Pole is affected by it.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:10%
If it was a direct
hit-- and NASA

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:10%
has made some projections of a
direct hit just on the United

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.462 align:middle line:10%
States alone, that if we get
directly hit by an X-flare,

00:01:58.462 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:10%
it will cost the nation upwards
of $2 trillion the first year.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.126 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gosh.

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: It will take about
4 to 10 years to recover,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.785 align:middle line:84%
and it will affect 90%
of the US population.

00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And when
you say affect,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about
possibility of death.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.826 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: Death.

00:02:17.826 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:10%
Death from starvation, disease,
lack of medical attention,

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:10%
all of these things
come into play.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:84%
You also will have
secondary problems evolving

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.340 align:middle line:84%
such as explosions
and fires because just

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
as in the Carrington
Event of 1859--

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.776 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Broken glass.

00:02:36.776 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Yeah, the telegraphs
actually created fires,

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:90%
and buildings were burning down.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
The telegraph poles
were on fire as a result

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
of this overload from
that solar flare.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now an
individual who would

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:84%
be outside when this
X-flare hits the planet,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to get hurt
directly from that, correct?

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: That's
my understanding.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.915 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unless they have
a pacemaker or something.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: If you
have a pacemaker,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:84%
it's really going to
impact the pacemaker

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
or any other
electronics you might

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
have for your artificial limbs,
for example, that will all

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:90%
be affected almost immediately.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Your hospitals certainly
will be affected,

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
but it will affect all
of your electronics,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:90%
and it would be instant.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, a
solar flare travels

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:84%
not at the speed of light
but at a much slower rate,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.830 align:middle line:84%
so it takes about two
days from the moment

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:90%
it happens to when we get hit.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Sometimes
they can be coming

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.430 align:middle line:84%
at such an accelerated rate it
could be down within 24 hours.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:90%
But it's not instant.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: No.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We would have a
warning, but the warning

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
will be-- it will give
some utilities a chance

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.710 align:middle line:90%
to shut down.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:90%
That's their defense.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Shut down the utilities
in hopes that--

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.382 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't get caught.

00:03:58.382 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Yeah,
that you don't fry.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's been my
personal experience

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:84%
to know that even with a nearby
lightning strike, if you have

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.566 align:middle line:84%
unplugged electronics nearby,
they're going to get fried.

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:13.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about your cars
that are all computerized now?

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:14.523 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: They're
all computerized.

00:04:14.523 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
They have electronic
ignition systems.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Emergency services
personnel tell me

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
that their vehicles
would be affected.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So with your communications
out and your emergency vehicles

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.479 align:middle line:84%
affected, people are going to be
wondering, well, what do we do

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and where do we go?

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
How do we get help, because
as you pointed out earlier,

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
the reaction will
be instantaneous

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.165 align:middle line:84%
of panic and pandemonium
throughout all

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
of these communities,
and if it happens

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.042 align:middle line:84%
over a wide geographical
area, you're

00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
going to have anarchy
almost immediately.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.583 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: And
that's the problem.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:10%
The thing is is
that-- and this is

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:10%
one of the things I think
I'd like to see included

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:10%
in any legislation is that
we recreate the civil defense

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:10%
centers that we used to have
during the height of the Cold

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:10%
War in which we'd have available
water, food, and medications

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.010 align:middle line:10%
on hand, and people
would know where

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:10%
to report to assuming that all
communications, all emergency

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:10%
services were knocked out.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:84%
That I think we
need to bring back.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.555 align:middle line:90%
It's a smart business.

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yeah.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's fundamentally
smart for survival purposes.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
At least people will know where
to report to, your emergency

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:84%
services and what have you
know then to gravitate there

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and give what further
orders they might need to.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:10%
But unless you
have a place where

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.760 align:middle line:10%
people can rally
in such an event,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.310 align:middle line:10%
they're just going to be going
off in every which direction,

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:10%
and that's going to lead
to even further chaos,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.700 align:middle line:10%
not to mention gangs
that will develop.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looting.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.707 align:middle line:84%
You see what happens just
with minor incursions.

00:05:53.707 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.789 align:middle line:90%
Exactly

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have partnered up
with wnd.com, the World Net

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Daily, and Michael Maloof, of
course, and Bill Forstchen who

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:84%
wrote the book
"One Second After."

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:84%
We have partnered
up with all of them

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
to get the information out
about EMP attacks and X-flares

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:90%
from the sun.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.390 align:middle line:90%
It is critical.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And that goal is to get to
some legislator or legislators

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
who will begin to pass
and implement legislation

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.870 align:middle line:90%
to get the grid insulated.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I think, Michael
thinks it's probably

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest issues
facing us as Americans today.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
people out there,

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Michael, who are just beginning
to understand-- thanks to us--

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.194 align:middle line:84%
what an EMP is and
what an X-flare is.

00:06:39.194 --> 00:06:39.735 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:06:39.735 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, I think we
have to educate people on this.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is not
part of their daily lives,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:90%
so they're not focusing on it.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.924 align:middle line:84%
But there is an educational
process involved here,

00:06:50.924 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's why,
with my book, I've

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:84%
tried to break it down
into plain-talk English.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:10%
And in my book, "A Nation
Forsaken," I've tried to--

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.582 align:middle line:10%
and it's a technical issue.

00:07:00.582 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:10%
There's no question about it.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question about it.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: But I'm a old policy
wonk, and I'm not a techie,

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and I had to understand
it so that I could put ut

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.370 align:middle line:90%
into plain-talk English.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I've done here.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And we've laid out
what the threats are

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:84%
to our life-sustaining,
critical infrastructures,

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
including the grid,
whether from-- in the event

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:84%
of a natural or
man-made EMP event.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:24.824 align:middle line:90%
And that's why--

00:07:24.824 --> 00:07:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And we also talk
about what people

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
can do at the personal
level for their families

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:90%
in order to be ready for that.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do a test at home.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:90%
Try it for two days.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:90%
I bet you can't.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Don't use water from the tap
because the power is out.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to work.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:90%
You can't use your refrigerator.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.740 align:middle line:90%
The power is out.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:90%
You can't watch television.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.430 align:middle line:84%
You can't use your cellphone
or your smartphone.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:90%
You can't go to the ATM.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So for two days,
live without anything

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:84%
that has to use
electrical power,

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and let's see what
your life is like.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.825 align:middle line:90%
I'd bet it would be miserable.

00:07:57.825 --> 00:07:59.324 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, I
think it would be,

00:07:59.324 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and people panic just overnight
when electricity goes out

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
in the event of a
storm-- local storm.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:84%
The other problem with that--
if this were to happen over

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:84%
a wide geographical area-- is
that in past disasters that

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:84%
covered some geographical
areas like a hurricane,

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
we've been able to bring
in people from the outside

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.360 align:middle line:90%
to assist.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To help.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: You may not have that.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.900 align:middle line:84%
You will not have that,
and that adds to the panic,

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:84%
I think, that's going to occur,
because we not only don't have

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.625 align:middle line:84%
the experts coming in and
there are fewer and fewer all

00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
the time because fewer and
fewer people are being trained

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:84%
in this, but we also
don't have the equipment.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.070 align:middle line:90%
We're not set up.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the
reserves of transformers,

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:90%
the large, large transformers.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.525 align:middle line:90%
They're specially ordered.

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:90%
They're specially designed.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Made in China.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Yeah, they're
made overseas primarily

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.645 align:middle line:90%
Japan, Korea, China.

00:08:51.645 --> 00:08:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there aren't
enough to get here.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: No.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:54.520 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.749 align:middle line:84%
And if you had a solar flare
that affected the world,

00:08:58.749 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
we'd just be standing
in line waiting

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.750 align:middle line:84%
because other industrialized
countries would be wanting them

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.751 align:middle line:84%
And you know those
that produce them

00:09:04.751 --> 00:09:07.291 align:middle line:84%
are going to be the ones that
are going to be serviced first.

00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Now what's intriguing is
that those countries that

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:84%
have experienced war
on their soil as I say,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:90%
are gearing up for an EMP event.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Israelis tell us
that if they launched

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:84%
as one of their scenarios
over Iran, an EMP,

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:84%
over Iran to knock out their
communications and their air

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:84%
defenses, it would
knock out power probably

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.816 align:middle line:84%
into southern Europe and
all of the Middle East.

00:09:32.816 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: But they could be
up and running in three days.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.639 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Israel could.

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: That's what they say.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:38.715 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Iran couldn't.

00:09:38.715 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: No.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They'd be down.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.496 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: They're
aware of an EMP.

00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:84%
They've been
practicing EMP attacks,

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and certainly the North
Koreans have, too,

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
from a man-made standpoint
of a high altitude

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:90%
nuclear explosion.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:84%
But if you're using
the solar flare,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
the world will be affected and
consequently other countries

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:84%
will be more equipped
for it than not.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese, for
example, just to show you

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:84%
that they're preparing, they
recently held an exercise,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and I just wrote a
story about this.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:84%
They just undertook an
exercise of an EMP attack

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:84%
from an outside power to see how
their facilities would hold up.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:84%
It affected all
of their airports

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and what have you, but
they actually staged an EMP

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.417 align:middle line:84%
assault from an outside
power, which would be US--

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: --in this case.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And they have directed
energy weapons, the US does,

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we
normally use when

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:84%
we go into countries such
as Iraq or what have you.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.748 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We take out their
command and control first.

00:10:39.748 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: You take out their
C2 stuff and actually their C4,

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.782 align:middle line:10%
which includes computers
and their communications.

00:10:46.782 --> 00:10:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just shut them down.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Shut them down
so they can't track you

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:90%
and then you can go in and bomb.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
So the Chinese have
been practicing

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
against such a
scenario, which tells me

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.785 align:middle line:84%
that they're preparing to deal
with such an event or not.

00:11:01.785 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We talked
about who would get hit,

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and if it's a big
X-flare, the entire planet

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:90%
gets blasted right?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: That's correct.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It would affect your
industrialized countries

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.340 align:middle line:84%
the most and whatever countries
were most affected in that

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.370 align:middle line:90%
pathway.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Your less developed
countries that

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:84%
don't rely so much on those
critical infrastructures

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.430 align:middle line:90%
as we do would be less effected.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It would effectively throw us
back into the 19th century.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people
cannot deal with that.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Most people would not
be able to deal with it.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Your more rural areas
would because people

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:90%
will plant gardens.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:90%
They store up things.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:90%
They have room to store things.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.630 align:middle line:84%
They know how to hunt, the
basic survivalist techniques,

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:84%
they know those things
for the most part.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.065 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
ones who will survive.

00:11:48.065 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, I hate
paying for insurance.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I hate paying health insurance.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I hate paying car insurance,
property insurance.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:90%
I hate insurance.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
But I'm glad I have it, because
that's exactly what it's for.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Its insurance against the
future, some event that

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:90%
could happen, and there you are.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:90%
You're somewhat protected.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I look at this as
the same thing.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.535 align:middle line:84%
It may not happen
in our lifetime.

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.451 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: It will happen.

00:12:17.451 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No doubt.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:90%
But who knows when.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:90%
This is an insurance policy.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So if we ensure our
cars and our houses

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and our jewelry and our health,
why don't we ensure this?

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: I would agree.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, Lloyd's
of London recently

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
came up as-- the major
insurance company

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.240 align:middle line:84%
has warning other
insurance companies

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
to start getting your clients
to make sure that they're EMP

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
resistant so that--
because a lot of the claims

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.030 align:middle line:84%
have been on the loss of
business due to power failures.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So true.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: And so consequently,
if you have an EMP event,

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be over a
far-extended period of time,

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:90%
everything would go bankrupt.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.287 align:middle line:90%
They will go bankrupt.

00:13:02.287 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
The insurance companies won't
be able to pay ultimately.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would love--
I hate to say this--

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.637 align:middle line:84%
but to see a very small
region of another country--

00:13:11.637 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Of course.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --have their power
go out for whatever reason

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and have them try
to exist for a week.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be an
international story,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and I think it
would also help us

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.875 align:middle line:84%
in this campaign to
get the grid fixed.

00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: It would be a
tragedy on the country that

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:84%
would be affected by this
because so many innocents would

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:90%
be involved.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.235 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:13:32.235 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: It would be a tragedy.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that
make me inhumane?

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: No, but
it accentuates, it

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:84%
underscores the problem of
what the impact could be even

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:90%
on a test basis.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could do a
survivalist type of thing,

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
but most people are not
oriented to gear that way

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.505 align:middle line:90%
the 21st century.

00:13:49.505 --> 00:13:50.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They couldn't
live this way.

00:13:50.495 --> 00:13:52.161 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: They wouldn't
be able to live.

00:13:52.161 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
trying to put out

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.232 align:middle line:84%
the warnings now because
of our reliance on--

00:13:56.232 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know we're late.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:90%
We're already late.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:58.961 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Oh, yeah.

00:13:58.961 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:90%
We're overdo.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.160 align:middle line:84%
NASA says that a
Carrington-like event

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
occurs about once
every 150 years.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:90%
We're overdo.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:11.470 align:middle line:84%
The one in 2012 they said
was at least as large

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:90%
as the Carrington Event.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.376 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hopefully
that was the one.

00:14:14.376 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Let's hope.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But you see we're at the zenith
of the solar storm maximum

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
The sun goes to peaks and
valleys every 11 years.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.614 align:middle line:84%
And on the way up and on
the way down in those peaks,

00:14:26.614 --> 00:14:28.030 align:middle line:84%
you're still going
to have flares.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a flare that's--
if you have a sunspot aimed

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.947 align:middle line:90%
at Earth, we're in trouble.

00:14:32.947 --> 00:14:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they launch
one, the flare launches--

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Some of these
flares, by the way,

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.246 align:middle line:84%
are at least 14 times
the size of the Earth.

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God, they're huge.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.328 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: They're huge.

00:14:42.328 --> 00:14:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This has to be
an X what to really cause

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.740 align:middle line:90%
significant power outage damage.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Dependent if it's
a direct hit, any X-flare.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Even a C-flare, if
it's a direct hit,

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:57.030 align:middle line:84%
could affect us, but not
as badly as the X-flare.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:84%
The man-made nuclear
explosion trumps them all.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
worse, the solar flare

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:84%
from the sun or the EMP
attack in the atmosphere?

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, it's the EMP
attack in the atmosphere.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:10%
That's what we call the E1,
E2 would be your lightning

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:10%
strikes, E3 would
be your flares.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:84%
But E1 incorporates
the E2s and E3s.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:84%
It just-- it's all
balled into one strike.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which of the two, EMP
or X-flare, is more probable

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:10%
or is it the same?

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Well that's a toughie.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I think an EMP
flare is imminent.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:41.025 align:middle line:84%
I think the potential for an
EMP attack is quite probable.

00:15:41.025 --> 00:15:42.316 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And growing every day.

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: And growing every day.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I would be ready for both, and
certainly the sun right now

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:90%
given where it is in its cycle.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It's always a threat
on a daily basi--

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:84%
on a minute-by-minute
basis, it's a threat,

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and we have less
than-- oftentimes

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:90%
less than 24 hours notice.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.540 align:middle line:84%
NASA is watching
it very closely,

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
but as soon as they
put out the warning,

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:84%
the notion is that,
well, the utilities

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
will begin to shut down to
try and protect the grids

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:90%
and have you.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:84%
But that's not going
to be good enough,

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and certainly it will be
inadequate, totally inadequate

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
if you have a man
made-attack from an EMP.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Astronauts aboard the
International Space Station,

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
they have a certain area to
go in case there's an X-flare.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Yes, but
also their electronics

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:90%
are not all EMP hardware either.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.091 align:middle line:84%
So they would be
basically stranded.

00:16:30.091 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:84%
It will certainly knock
out our satellites

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, we
rely more and more

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.365 align:middle line:90%
on satellites for communication.

00:16:34.365 --> 00:16:35.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:35.515 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: And so we're
building up that.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.854 align:middle line:84%
So if we can harden
all of our electronics

00:16:41.854 --> 00:16:44.395 align:middle line:84%
within the satellites, at least
that affords some protection.

00:16:44.395 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we living on
borrowed time, Michael?

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: We are on
totally borrowed time.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:84%
If we are already overdue
for an EMP flare event,

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.620 align:middle line:84%
we certainly are
on borrowed time

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
because if we could get
that legislation passed

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.945 align:middle line:84%
theoretically tomorrow, it
will take a least five years--

00:17:00.945 --> 00:17:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: --to try to
get everything going.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:04.839 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anything could
happen in five years.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.671 align:middle line:10%
And then you have politics that
are going to enter into this,

00:17:07.671 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:10%
and this is what breaks
everything down for us

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.500 align:middle line:10%
and why we can never
succeed anymore.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we had events leading
up to World War II happening

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:84%
today, we never would have
gone into World War II

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.265 align:middle line:84%
because we couldn't
make a decision.

00:17:22.265 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
headed for disaster?

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.839 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: If we stay
on the present track

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're undertaking in doing
nothing, we certainly are.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But we have the means
to overcome that.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.980 align:middle line:84%
We have the capability
to change all that.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:84%
The tragedy is that we're doing
nothing about it right now.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's the most
bizarre aspect of all of this.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Which leads, then,
to your conspiracy theory

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.285 align:middle line:90%
of, well, is this purposeful?

00:17:48.285 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why did it happen?

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.089 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:49.089 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's wipe out the population.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:51.404 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: We can
test that theory.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.800 align:middle line:84%
We can see, well,
we're pushing this,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:84%
pushing this, push this,
trying to get legislators done.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.477 align:middle line:84%
We're doing our part
from our standpoint.

00:18:01.477 --> 00:18:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we need to get the private
sector, some of the big money

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
guys who brag about all
the money they have.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's have them put it into an
EMP pot and put up or shut up

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and then we have it there, and
then if things are not done,

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:84%
then we know something
else is cooking.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And what that is, is
probably more diabolical

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:90%
than we've faced at all.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're spending-- and
rightfully so-- $13 billion

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.710 align:middle line:84%
to $16 billion to try to
fix the VA hospital system.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Rightfully so.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Our veterans need the best
coverage and protection

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:90%
they can get.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.555 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Absolutely.

00:18:35.555 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we're talking $13
billion to $16 billion dollars.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:90%
The money is there.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:40.980 align:middle line:90%
It's available.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So your estimate of $2
billion for the grid,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:90%
let's say it gets to $4 billion.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.410 align:middle line:84%
That's nothing compared to
the protection of the United

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:84%
If we had a power grid
that was protected

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:84%
so we wouldn't have to
worry about an EMP attack

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and we wouldn't have to worry
about an X-flare from the sun,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
all we really had to worry about
was some rogue terrorist trying

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
to do a dirty bomb in the
country or something like that,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:90%
we can manage that.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:07.995 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: We can
manage it absolutely.

00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the
other ones we can't.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.965 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, we
can do a combination

00:19:10.965 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
of the two, the federal and
the private contributions,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:90%
bring them together.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
would propose, again,

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Obama, with the
stroke of his pen,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
could actually install
an EMP coordinator

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:84%
for the federal, state, and
local coordination of getting

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:33.134 align:middle line:84%
the grids working again
and hardened properly.

00:19:33.134 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that
those funds are

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.170 align:middle line:90%
directed where they need to go.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.592 align:middle line:84%
And this could all be done
now without the legislation--

00:19:38.592 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: But he
hasn't done that.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.891 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think if the
president went on the air

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow night and said,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to tell you about
a critical situation that

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:84%
could affect the livelihood
of all Americans,

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to fix it.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Effective immediately, I
have a committee in place

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
that is going to begin
to allocate $2 billion

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.600 align:middle line:84%
to insulate our power grid,
have a few people up there that

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:84%
explain what that is,
and turn them loose.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:06.830 align:middle line:90%
He can do that.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: He can do it under his
existing authority in directing

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
the Department of Homeland
Security to take action right

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.310 align:middle line:84%
now, to make, whether it's from
a natural or a man-made EMP

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:90%
event, to--

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
national security.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: It is all
national security

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:90%
because we'll all be affected.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.230 align:middle line:84%
National security
will be affected,

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.914 align:middle line:84%
and if all that is knocked
out, if all of our critical

00:20:26.914 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
infrastructures and
knocked out, then we

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.360 align:middle line:84%
open ourselves up to much more--
even greater vulnerabilities

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:90%
than we have right now.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.411 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, we have
a lot of vulnerabilities.

00:20:35.411 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a 2016
election coming up soon.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
What if we can get
these candidates

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:90%
to start talking about this?

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Newt Gingrich did
during his time.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if we
can get that going?

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, I think we
need to start focusing on that.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.002 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we need to focus
on Congress because we've

00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:84%
got-- we're going to get
a new Congress coming in

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully start
getting them there,

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and then we could start working
towards 2016 to push candidates

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:84%
in this direction, and I think
if we can combine our resources

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and have people say to
candidates what would

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:84%
you do in case of an EMP,
how would you fix it?

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll
probably say, what?

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Exactly.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well, he
needs to be educated,

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.723 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully, that will be what
we're trying to do right now.

00:21:21.723 --> 00:21:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has every member
of Congress seen this book?

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Yes.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:26.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:21:26.675 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Yeah, they
all have a copy.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.791 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Excellent.

00:21:28.791 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: They all have a
copy, and the EMP caucuses

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
are very aware of the book
as well as Forstchen's book.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:84%
We're trying, if we can get
the caucus members to come

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.190 align:middle line:84%
on board the program
to talk about this,

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I think that's also
going to be highly

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:90%
educational to the public.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think if
we can get this done,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Michael, you would be one
of those as a national hero.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think of nothing
more important than doing this.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:90%
We live on technology.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It's unfortunate that we've
gone as far as we have in

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
that we have relied
so much on this.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Heck, I even remember
during the '60s,

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
we weren't nearly as
dependent on this.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:90%
I used a slide rule in school.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a calculator.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:84%
But times have changed, and
we are now computer driven.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:90%
We're smartphone driven.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:90%
We're technology driven.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.235 align:middle line:90%
Our cars are driven with this.

00:22:20.235 --> 00:22:23.322 align:middle line:84%
It is just illogical
not to fix this.

00:22:23.322 --> 00:22:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Well,
it's been my career

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.260 align:middle line:84%
to be a public servant since
I worked for the Defense

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Department in the federal
government about 30 years.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I look upon this less for
personal aggrandizement

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.340 align:middle line:84%
than to fix a serious problem
that's going to affect us all,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:84%
because all of us
will be affected,

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and our lives will be totally
miserable if we survive it.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You should get
the Nobel Peace Prize.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.587 align:middle line:90%
You should be on Time magazine.

00:22:46.587 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what should happen.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: I just want
to see us get it done.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
be an amazing story

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
is let's assume
it does get done,

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:84%
we insulate the grid and
then a huge X-flare hits us,

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:00.730 align:middle line:90%
and we were protected.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
But some other nation
that didn't do it,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.930 align:middle line:90%
they're wiped out, sadly.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.826 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: They could be, but
other nations are picking up.

00:23:07.826 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
The Brits, for example,
Great Britain--

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're behind
the eight ball.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.204 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: We are
behind the eight ball.

00:23:12.204 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:84%
The British government,
their defense ministry

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:18.090 align:middle line:84%
recently warned about
an EMP, and they now

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
are taking measures
within Great Britain

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:90%
to harden their grid system.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.522 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
they just woke up

00:23:23.522 --> 00:23:24.730 align:middle line:90%
and they know about this now.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:25.405 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: They know about it.

00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:25.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:23:25.845 --> 00:23:27.053 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: They know about it.

00:23:27.053 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:10%
We've talked to
their-- to counterparts

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.350 align:middle line:10%
in Great Britain about this.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It's getting our politicians who
are hung up on everything else

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:84%
to focus on something
that's really

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.767 align:middle line:90%
tangible and above politics.

00:23:39.767 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:40.796 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: And
that's what we need

00:23:40.796 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:84%
to be-- how we need to
be treating this issue is

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.461 align:middle line:84%
above politics because it does
affect the national survival.

00:23:48.461 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we talk
about their concern

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
for the fiscal cliff, and
for this, and for that.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: This is real.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.423 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is right
here, and again, it's

00:23:57.423 --> 00:23:58.540 align:middle line:90%
an insurance policy.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest
insurance policy

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:90%
we could buy as a nation.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: I think so, and
if we mitigate this problem,

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:84%
then we lessen the
vulnerabilities

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:90%
that we have facing us today.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then we can
concentrate on other issues

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that are so important
on this planet as well.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: And we take
away a very strong weapon

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:84%
on the part of those
with nuclear weapons.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:84%
If we have missile
defenses that can

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:84%
take care of an incoming
missile, we can at least--

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:31.190 align:middle line:84%
we protect against
any nuclear area that

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:84%
will affect our
communications, then

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.930 align:middle line:84%
we start focusing
on other things.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:90%
That's what we should be doing.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.626 align:middle line:84%
There doesn't seem to
be any priorities coming

00:24:40.626 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:90%
from the White House.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
no organization.

00:24:42.305 --> 00:24:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: None.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Zero

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.868 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
no clear-cut goal.

00:24:44.868 --> 00:24:47.337 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.337 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you, it was the same

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.300 align:middle line:84%
during the previous
administration, too.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:84%
The situation going into
Iraq, I was never in favor of,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and now we're there, that's
a disaster, out of control.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
We have to do something for
those poor minorities in Iraq,

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.619 align:middle line:84%
much more than what
we're doing now.

00:25:08.619 --> 00:25:09.160 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any clear
cut goals or plans.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:84%
At least it felt during
the Kennedy administration

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:90%
we had a mission.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
He was faced, of course,
with the Cuban Missile

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Crisis and some other issues,
and the racial mix, and all

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.900 align:middle line:84%
But he clearly had a goal that
was to set a man on the moon

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.806 align:middle line:84%
before the end of the
'60s, and we did that.

00:25:28.806 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:90%
We accomplished that.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.167 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: Even
with Ronald Reagan,

00:25:31.167 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and that's when I came in.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:84%
We had a goal to take
down the Soviet Union,

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:90%
and we accomplished that.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without any guns.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:39.451 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: That's correct.

00:25:39.451 --> 00:25:41.530 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:46.060 align:middle line:84%
We pulled it off, but we went
in, and everything we did

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.510 align:middle line:90%
was oriented in that direction.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.635 align:middle line:84%
We could be doing the same
with this, treating this

00:25:49.635 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:84%
as a national security
priority for this country,

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and everything we do is
oriented in that direction

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:84%
from our defense systems
to our everyday consumer

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.980 align:middle line:84%
electronic dependencies and
our automated control systems.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Everything needs to be upgraded.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Technology is always
upgraded anyway,

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.450 align:middle line:84%
but in doing that, you
ensure that it's hardened

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and that it's
insulated properly,

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.894 align:middle line:84%
and we should be
focusing on that now.

00:26:15.894 --> 00:26:17.684 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, do
you find that since we

00:26:17.684 --> 00:26:20.174 align:middle line:84%
started the campaign and
started to push it nationally,

00:26:20.174 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:84%
even though you
were out with this

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and WND was out with
this a long time ago,

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:28.090 align:middle line:84%
are you starting to get more
exposure, more media requests?

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Is that starting to grow?

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MALOOF: As a result of
being on your program,

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting more radio
requests to be on

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.207 align:middle line:90%
to talk about this issue.

00:26:36.207 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.665 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Absolutely.

00:26:37.665 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I have
asked people locally

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.860 align:middle line:84%
to bombard their senators
and Congress person.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:84%
If you live in Michigan, don't
bombard the Congress people

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:47.830 align:middle line:90%
in Minnesota.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to work, but
you concentrate on your own.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:10%
>>MALOOF: Concentrate on
your own representatives

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.435 align:middle line:10%
at the federal and state levels
and certainly the governor.

00:26:57.435 --> 00:27:00.349 align:middle line:10%
The governor, they
have a national group

00:27:00.349 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:10%
that gets together.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:10%
They can make recommendations
to the president,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:10%
and that's what they need to be
doing, making this a priority

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.260 align:middle line:10%
on their agenda when they
come together to meet.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we get this done,
I'm buying the champagne.

00:27:11.595 --> 00:27:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Sounds good to me.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:13.232 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:27:13.232 --> 00:27:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Michael.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MALOOF: Thank you, George.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael Maloof, the
book, "A Nation Forsaken."

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.501 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you it's the biggest
single issue facing this nation

00:27:20.501 --> 00:27:21.000 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:10%
If we take care of
this, we can concentrate

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:10%
on all the other problems
and issues as well.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:26.880 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.780 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:45.567 align:middle line:90%
