00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: How did you
get started in this area?

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DEBBIE SOLARIS: I had an
extraterrestrial contact

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Ever since after that, my
extrasensory perception

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.050 align:middle line:90%
just increased 100-fold.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us your take on
what the Akashic records are.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: To me, they're
the energetic records

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:90%
of the entire universe.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.448 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it so important
for us to access these records?

00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: A lot of
clients will come to me

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:84%
because they want to know
what their soul's journey is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.050 align:middle line:90%
beyond Earth.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:84%
What was the first
inception of their soul?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:84%
What was their
first incarnation?

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
What other star systems
did they go through?

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:90%
It empowers them.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:84%
They start feeling
like, oh, maybe I

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.910 align:middle line:84%
can start that
spiritual business,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:84%
or maybe I can leave that
job or that relationship,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
or maybe I can move
across the country.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So it does have life
changing effects on people.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:10%
Debbie Solaris is
an ET contactee,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:10%
an interdimensional traveler,
a galactic historian,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:10%
and, through her
ancestral connection

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:10%
with the Akashic records,
she receives downloads

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:10%
of galactic
historical information

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:10%
and universal
spiritual knowledge.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Deborah, welcome
back to the program.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, thanks
for having me back.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.593 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited to be here.

00:01:21.593 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You look
wonderful, by the way.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.305 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, thank you.

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:10%
There's been a little bit of
a change since the last time

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:10%
we met.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Lost about 67 pounds.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 67 pounds.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.707 align:middle line:90%
How'd you do that?

00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: Had a little
bit of surgical help

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:10%
but also a lot of
lifestyle changes.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:10%
You know, I changed my diet.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.793 align:middle line:10%
I exercise almost every day now.

00:01:40.793 --> 00:01:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.562 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Do yoga,
meditation, all of it.

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can
feel a difference?

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.525 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's nothing like
taking care of your health,

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't take
care of your health, Deb,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:84%
you can't give us this
vital information you've

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:90%
been giving us over the years.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, well, thank you.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.502 align:middle line:84%
That's very sweet
of you to say that.

00:01:57.502 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
started in this area?

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, it
happened back in 2012.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I had an extraterrestrial
contact experience,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.300 align:middle line:84%
which I talked about
I think more at length

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:90%
with the last show that we did.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.715 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was brought on
board an Arcturian starship.

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How old were
you, just a little kid?

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: No.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:90%
I was 50.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.600 align:middle line:90%
I was 50 years old.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I was 50.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Happened
later in life for you.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:90%
It happened later in life.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.210 align:middle line:90%
50 years old.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It took me
a while to wake up.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I was
on board the ship,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:90%
encountered extraterrestrials.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:90%
And ever since after I had--

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I had experiences
on board the ship

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
so the first one
was in June 2012.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
The second experience
was in December 2012.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And ever since after
that, I started having--

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:84%
my extrasensory perception
just increased 100-fold.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:90%
It was like I was seeing auras.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:90%
I was picking up--

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bing.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like something
just turned on.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.107 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they select
you or why did they select you?

00:02:58.107 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I always
get that question.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.357 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually
the first question

00:03:01.357 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I asked the Arcturians when
I was on board the ship.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:90%
I said, why me?

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm just ordinary.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm nobody special.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And they told me it
was because I sent out

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
a prayer to the universe asking
for help for planet Earth.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:90%
And they heard my prayer.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
impressed with the prayer.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It was a very earnest
prayer asking for assistance

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.223 align:middle line:90%
for all beings on planet Earth.

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And the
other reason is

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:84%
because I guess, apparently, my
soul originated from Arcturus.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're like my star
family, which I didn't never

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:90%
even realize that before.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
seeded you perhaps?

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.133 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain what
the craft looked like.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:90%
This fascinates me.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle line:90%
I do remember.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.000 align:middle line:84%
I remember everything like
it happened yesterday.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
The craft looked like a
starship but it wasn't metallic.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of sentient.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
It was a sentient being
because it shifted and changed.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:90%
It was made of light.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was made of
plasma-like material

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:90%
so it was very kind of fluid.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:90%
And it would shift and change.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:90%
It kind of read your mind.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of directing
me towards a certain room.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of
followed along.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was a technology
I've never seen before.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible, George.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:90%
It was just incredible.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there other
beings on the craft?

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:90%
There was.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was directed
to the room, there

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
was five extraterrestrial
beings that didn't look human.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean they were
obviously not human.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Describe their
shape for us, Deb.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.987 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: They had larger
heads, smaller bodies.

00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
The bodies were kind
of insignificant.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The typical alien grey?

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: No.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:84%
They didn't quite
look like grey aliens,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:84%
because they had larger eyes
but their eyes had pupils

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:90%
and irises.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So it was not the
typical grey look.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And their skin
color was different.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:90%
It was more like a bluish green.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
But it was hard to
kind of look at them.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of hard
because they had big auras.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Their auras were so huge.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.882 align:middle line:84%
And they were so bright I
couldn't look at them directly.

00:05:17.882 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
I had to look at them
from the periphery.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.382 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
communicate with you,

00:05:21.382 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:90%
via telepathy?

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Telepathy, yes.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.605 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Now you're a galactic historian.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: That's right.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I know.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It was actually something I
didn't come up with myself.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.465 align:middle line:84%
I was always
getting information.

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to get
downloads of information

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:84%
from anything from the Akashic
records on galactic wars,

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:84%
galactic events, different
star systems, different star

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.370 align:middle line:90%
beings, and also astronomy.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And I never studied any
of this stuff before.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just
trying to figure out

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:90%
what the heck is going on.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And somebody dubbed me
a galactic historian.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of stuck, you know.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:84%
But a galactic
historian is somebody

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
who follows the history of
the entire galactic realm

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.480 align:middle line:90%
not just here on Earth.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to meditate
in order to get into this mode?

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I do my own
form of meditation.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I'm preparing for
say a session with a client,

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I imagine like a shaft
of light between me

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:90%
and the Akashic records.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's really pretty basic.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's not
really difficult.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.530 align:middle line:84%
But I just imagine the shaft of
light connecting me, the Earth,

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.690 align:middle line:90%
and the higher realms.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I do a little
bit of a prayer.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And it just connects me
instantly with the records.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had an
opportunity to talk

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:84%
with Bill Foss, who's an
expert on the Akashic records.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he gives us his
take on what they may be.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL FOSS: It all
started about 20 years ago.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:10%
I was a touring musician,
professional musician,

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:01.800 align:middle line:10%
and an artist, and working as
a professional artist as well.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:10%
And there had to be more
with all the creativity

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.620 align:middle line:10%
that I was channeling naturally.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:10%
At one point, it seemed like
there was an invisible world

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.590 align:middle line:10%
attached to the other
side of the paintbrush

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:10%
with the images that
were coming through.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to know more.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I started asking God please
show me the way it all works.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And that week, in fact
the very next day,

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I was guided to a teacher,
a special private teacher.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And books started being
put in front of me that

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle line:90%
were talking about the records.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And I then had my
first experiences

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:90%
of going into the records.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Deb, give
us your take on what

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:90%
the Akashic records are.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: To me, they're
the energetic records

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.670 align:middle line:90%
of the entire universe.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So they contain information
on every single star system,

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
every single location,
every single being,

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.650 align:middle line:90%
whether they're humanoid or not.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Even animals and plants
have Akashic records.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And the information
a lot of times

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:84%
is so vast that you
almost have to go

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
in there with a kind
of a precision mindset

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, I'm just going
to look at the records

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:84%
for this particular person,
or for this particular event,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
or this particular planet.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
You can actually get
Akashic records on planets.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's recording
the information for us?

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Who's writing them
down, basically?

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I don't think
anybody's writing them down.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are
certain beings that--

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.650 align:middle line:90%
because the records are fluid.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.539 align:middle line:90%
They shift and change.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But I think there are
certain beings that

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.450 align:middle line:90%
maintain the records.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding is that
there are Arcturian beings that

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.410 align:middle line:84%
are maintaining the
records because Arcturians

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.180 align:middle line:84%
are the guardians of the
stargate that processes souls

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84%
between life and
death or between death

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:90%
and the next incarnation.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And so they have regular
access to the Akashic records.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:90%
And so they're maintaining them.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're higher
dimensional beings.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I connect
with the records

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and I see the Akashic
guides, they always

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:90%
look like Arcturians to me.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's what
I'm familiar with.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.007 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now can you
access anybody's records?

00:09:18.007 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it'll
tell you things

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:90%
that I've done in my life?

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:90%
You could just glance at them?

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.020 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:84%
When I do an Akashic
records reading,

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I oftentimes do it for
people I don't know.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And I'll be telling
them things from the records.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, oh my
gosh, how do you know that?

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:90%
How do you know that?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:84%
This is not something I
would tell anybody, you know?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, that
confirms that the records

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:84%
are touching on something that's
meaningful for that person

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:84%
or has some sort of
relevance for them.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.677 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will the records
tell you your future?

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.662 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that's already
etched in stone as well.

00:09:57.662 --> 00:09:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I wouldn't
say it's etched in stone.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it's a
probability, because us,

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
as free will individuals,
we can always make decisions

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:90%
that can change our future.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So when you go
into a client's records

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at
their future probabilities,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:90%
that's what it is.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's probabilities.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you can
ask Akashic guides

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:84%
like what's the percentage of
probability that will likely

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:84%
happen for this person
for this particular event.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, OK, there's
a 60% chance this will happen

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:90%
or a 70% chance.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll tell
that to the client.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And so it gives a client
I think an idea of, OK,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
if I want to keep
this future event,

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.700 align:middle line:84%
I'll just keep doing
what I'm doing.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
But they also have the
capabilities of changing.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So they can change
their decisions

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:84%
around things that could
change their outcomes.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the Akashic records
aren't necessarily what will be

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.142 align:middle line:90%
but what could be.

00:10:59.142 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It could be.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:00.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in your
particular case, you read them?

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Most
clients that come to me

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
or that want to work with me
want to work with me because I

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.240 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to access
records beyond Earth,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
because I do notice that
a lot of Akashic readers

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
just do Earth records, which
I never figured out why

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:90%
because the records are vast.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
You can get records
on other universes.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's how vast they are.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
clients will come to me

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.350 align:middle line:84%
because they want to know
what their soul's journey is

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:90%
beyond Earth.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.810 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
where they came from.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:39.110 align:middle line:84%
They want to know who they
are, who they truly are.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm doing an
Akashic records reading,

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I actually do kind of
like 180 degree view

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:90%
of their soul's journey.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the whole view
of where they started off at.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
What was the first
inception of their soul?

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.060 align:middle line:84%
What was their
first incarnation?

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.180 align:middle line:84%
What other star systems
did they go through?

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.598 align:middle line:84%
If they only had Earth lives,
where did they start off at?

00:12:00.598 --> 00:12:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Did they start off in Atlantis?

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Did they start off in Lemuria?

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're able to look at that
and just give them an idea of,

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
oh yeah, this is
my soul's journey.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:90%
This is who I truly am.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:90%
This is my divine cosmic self.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a difference, Deb,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.170 align:middle line:84%
between the galactic
Akashic records

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and just Akashic records, or
is it all one in the same?

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think, honestly,
they're one and the same.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I think the only
difference is that, when

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
you're going into
the records, you're

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:90%
not just stopping at Earth.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:90%
You're going beyond Earth.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
when the soul first

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:84%
had its inception as a
soul, as an individual soul,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
because we're also
shards of source.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're
doing readings,

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
does the individual give you
feedback or how does that work?

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you do
a reading on me?

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what happens.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.340 align:middle line:90%
I just need your birth date.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.207 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 06/04/50.

00:13:02.207 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: 06/04/50.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh OK.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting date.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I am seeing-- this is
an Earth life I think.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing ancient Egypt.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I do see that in this lifetime,
you were an advisor to Pharaoh.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think you were
trying to see something

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
about expanding the kingdom
of Egypt at that time.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.158 align:middle line:84%
You do have
communication skills.

00:13:41.158 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean I think that's
pretty obvious.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had them then
and I have them now.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: You have them now.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And so you were trying
to act as an emissary

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:84%
to try to expand
Egypt peacefully,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't want to
do this the warlike way.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.530 align:middle line:90%
You wanted to--

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The diplomatic way.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.200 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to do more
the diplomatic way.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's part
of your personality

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:84%
where I think you're somebody
that you would rather

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:84%
take the peaceful-- and you're
kind of non-confrontational

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you're somebody
that would purposefully

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:84%
try to start a
conflict with somebody.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But what I see is that you
ran across a lot of resistance

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
in certain parts of Africa,
because they were trying

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.720 align:middle line:84%
to expand more south,
because they're already

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:84%
pretty much established
in the Delta area of Egypt

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.640 align:middle line:84%
but they were trying
to expand south.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And you traveled south to
Ethiopia and to other parts

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:90%
of more southern Africa.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lot of
going back and forth.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:90%
You were getting frustrated.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And you felt like it
was a failed project.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And so then the pharaoh
decided, well, we're

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:90%
just going to take them over.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I think at some point, you
felt like, why couldn't I

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.063 align:middle line:84%
communicate what
my intention was?

00:15:08.063 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this
wouldn't have happened.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:15:12.105 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:90%
My father was born in Cairo.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you knew that.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: No.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:90%
I did not know that.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's an
interesting correlation

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:90%
between that.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But you've had I think
several lives in Egypt

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:90%
so that was just one of them.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't I remember
how they built the pyramids?

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I don't know.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to remember
how they built--

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.920 align:middle line:84%
actually, I do see that
in the record sometimes.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:90%
They used sound--

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I think they used sound
frequency to move the stones.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
something like that, too.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was a
bunch of slaves toiling away

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:90%
trying to transport stones.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I think it was sound--

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
they were using some high level
technology back in those days.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now people
are influenced

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:90%
by their star lineage.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: A lot of us--

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to kind of dial
back to Dolores Cannon,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:90%
because she's one of my idols.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:90%
I love Dolores.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've read
several of her books.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.942 align:middle line:84%
I love the books that
she written about.

00:16:09.942 --> 00:16:12.525 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The Three Waves of
Volunteers and the New Earth."

00:16:12.525 --> 00:16:13.325 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:13.325 --> 00:16:14.520 align:middle line:90%
She was quite a person.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: She was an
amazing, amazing person.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I kind of consider
her to be my mentor.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, she kind of paved
the path for me to do my work.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
But I always refer to
that book because there

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
was so many of us that came
from other star systems that

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
are currently incarnated
here on Earth at this time.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us are our
old souls that didn't even

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:90%
originate from here from Earth.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.360 align:middle line:84%
We originated from
other star systems.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And so when a client of mine
who has a suspicion they

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:90%
might be a star seed--

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and I'll explain
what a star seed is.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And they might want to know
what's my star lineage.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Am I connected to Lyra?

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Am I connected to the Pleiades?

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.465 align:middle line:90%
Am I connected to Vega?

00:16:57.465 --> 00:17:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And so this gives them an
indication of who they are,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:84%
because the galactic history
of each of these locations

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
ends up determining, to a
certain extent, the personality

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:84%
of the person, because they
went through certain events

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:90%
in their past lives.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I want to
get your reaction to this.

00:17:20.325 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Matias de Stefano was on the
Gaia program "Initiation."

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he's great.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he talked
a lot about star lineage

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:90%
and the Akashic records.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's get your reaction
to what we see here.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO:
12,000 years ago, I

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:90%
started on this journey.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And this lifetime, I
hope to fulfill it.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
My dream is that you
fulfill yours as well.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Once we have the tools to be
bigger than society, bigger

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:84%
than our current
bodies, and larger

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:84%
than our understanding
of who we think we are,

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:58.770 align:middle line:84%
we will be able to
contribute our unique soul

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.940 align:middle line:84%
imprint into this
time period of change.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So what's he saying?

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I totally resonate
with what he's saying.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.830 align:middle line:84%
What he's saying
is that we're all

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.130 align:middle line:84%
soul shards of
bigger soul groups

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.000 align:middle line:90%
or what I call oversouls.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And each of these oversouls had
a vision for the experiences

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.850 align:middle line:90%
that they wanted to have.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why star
lineage is really important

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.350 align:middle line:10%
because depending on what
star system you're from

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.700 align:middle line:10%
might determine your path, or
your particular galactic gifts,

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.900 align:middle line:10%
or your personality.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who chooses
that direction?

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think the soul does
itself because we are free will

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:90%
We get to choose that.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just like we
choose our parents.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Exactly.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I do get souls
that, for example, I

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:84%
get some souls that maybe
are Arcturian souls that

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:84%
are more spiritual
guides and teachers

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:84%
but they're also very
technical so they come in

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:90%
with those skill sets.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Then you get souls from
say Merope and the Pleiades

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and they're
psychospiritual healers.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:84%
You might get souls from Sirius
that are doctors and nurses

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
because they were masters
of physical healing.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So it does have quite a bit
of impact in our personalities

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and also in the
type of work that we

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
might be drawn to
or the type of even

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.270 align:middle line:90%
things we might be drawn to.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Debbie, how
does this knowledge

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
affect your life and
the way you live today?

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: When I first
started Akashic readings,

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:38.220 align:middle line:84%
my husband used to tell me,
I don't see this taking off.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows what the
Akashic records are.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't think--

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --what are you doing?

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't see you making
it in this field.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was just laughing at him
because, somehow in my heart,

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this was going
to become big, that it

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:90%
was going to become huge.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think what it
does for a person--

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:84%
it empowers them because
we go through this veil

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:90%
of forgetfulness.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:90%
We forget who we are.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: And we forget--

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that's
natural, isn't it?

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It's not necessarily
meant to be, though.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all meant to be
able to remember everything

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.275 align:middle line:90%
about ourselves.

00:20:12.275 --> 00:20:13.275 align:middle line:90%
I think it's just a 3D--

00:20:13.275 --> 00:20:14.483 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --I don't know, Deb.

00:20:14.483 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
In past lives, people
don't remember, generally,

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:84%
who they are unless
they're under hypnotherapy.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some kind of
mechanism that protects us

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:90%
from some of the past.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: That could
be it, but I also

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:10%
think that's not the
natural state of being,

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:10%
that once we ascend
to the fifth dimension

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:10%
that we will start to
remember our past lives.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
We will start to have
that past connection.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:84%
But maybe here on Earth
because of certain experiences

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:84%
that we've chosen
to have because,

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:84%
remember we're free-will
beings, maybe we had to forget.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that was what we
chosen, to forget so that we

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:90%
can work on remembering.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's also that
aspect of it too.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:84%
But I do think people, once
they have an Akashic records

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:84%
reading, particularly in
a galactic Akashic records

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:90%
reading, it empowers them.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.610 align:middle line:84%
They start feeling
like, oh, maybe I

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:middle line:84%
can start that
spiritual business.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I can leave that
job or that relationship.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I can move
across the country.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So it does have life-changing
effects on people.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
star systems are out there?

00:21:18.965 --> 00:21:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Hundreds
of thousands.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's the
importance of the star system?

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Is one a little more
important than another one?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, I
think I explained

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.610 align:middle line:84%
this in a recent show I
did with Regina Meredith.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:84%
There are certain star systems
that are more directly involved

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:84%
with Earth, that maybe have
more of an interest in Earth.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe they seeded us.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.747 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Exactly, exactly.

00:21:41.747 --> 00:21:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they're watching us.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.372 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: They're watching us.

00:21:44.372 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I understand there's
22 races that

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:90%
have seeded us here on Earth.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
bring up Regina.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:84%
On "Open Minds," she
talked to Raymond Tarpey

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.175 align:middle line:90%
about human origin.

00:21:53.175 --> 00:21:54.586 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:21:54.586 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: So
what was, according

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient legends,
what was the nature of Mu?

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I know we talked
off camera a bit,

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and you were saying that
was a spiritually very clean

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.870 align:middle line:90%
environment for those souls.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RAYMOND TARPEY:
According to Edgar Cayce,

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Mu Lemuria was the place
of all the civilizations

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:84%
that have been established
upon the surface of the Earth.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:84%
It was in Mu Lemuria that they
reached their highest spirit

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And Metatron, a person that
channels ancient history--

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I read all of the Metatron
stuff to everybody.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I leave nothing out
because we do not

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:84%
know which soul is appointed
with certain information.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're off base in some.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But some of the
details will be true.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And so I read everything.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: So what
does Metatron say?

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:54.805 align:middle line:84%
>>TARPEY: A Metatron says
that they were mostly ethereal

00:22:54.805 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:84%
in the early times of Mu
Lemuria, so, therefore,

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.493 align:middle line:84%
they could have that
more spiritual--

00:23:00.493 --> 00:23:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Ethereal as in--

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:90%
I say "eth-ear-eal."

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it "eth-ah-real"?

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: "Eth-ear-eal," yeah.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Ethereal.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
more of the ether.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>TARPEY: The Akash.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:09.940 align:middle line:90%
The Akashic.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it was easier
for them to attain it.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.887 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing the
detail that they get into when

00:23:18.887 --> 00:23:19.970 align:middle line:90%
they're dealing with this.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.180 align:middle line:84%
How did they become
so spiritual, I guess?

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how does
a guy like Raymond

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:90%
pick up all these things?

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think once you
get an alignment with, I think,

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:84%
your higher self and
your higher guidance.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just something
that maybe happens naturally

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:90%
for some people.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So other people might have to
work a little bit harder at it.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But my guess is that
Raymond probably

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:84%
has access to the
Akashic records,

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.108 align:middle line:90%
so he's picking up a lot.

00:23:48.108 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I know when I do
Akashic records reading,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:90%
I get a lot of detail.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a lot
of detail, even more

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
than what maybe I
went into because we

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:84%
had a limited amount of time
with your little reading.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.720 align:middle line:90%
But it's a lot of detail.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
I'm channeling,

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and I don't even realize
while I'm channeling

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:90%
half the time what I'm saying.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Until I listen to
the recording back.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
I record all my
sessions, and I'm

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:84%
like, wow, that was a lot
of detail that came through.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.713 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like you're
channeling the information.

00:24:18.713 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's coming from
somewhere, and it's coming

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:21.920 align:middle line:90%
from the Akashic records.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can an
individual, Debbie,

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:90%
access their own records?

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they do that?

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.232 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think
it takes practice.

00:24:31.232 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:84%
But I always say that everybody
can access the Akashic records.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And soon, I think
in the coming years,

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I think as humans expand
their consciousness

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and we start getting more
online with our intuitive gifts,

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all going to be
able to access the records.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I think the way
a person would do it is just

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:90%
maybe set the intention that--

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.370 align:middle line:90%
and there is a process.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know
Linda Howe teaches

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
a really nice process of
accessing the Akashic records.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And I do use her method,
because I like her method.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:84%
But you can even channel
the Akashic records

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:90%
without a formal process.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just mainly
setting the intention

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:90%
of accessing the records.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're accessing the
records for yourself,

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:84%
you use your own birthdate,
your own full name.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're accessing the
records for somebody else,

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:84%
you might use their full
name and their birthdate.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.270 align:middle line:90%
And bam, you're in the records.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Now when I access
the records, it

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.710 align:middle line:90%
looks like a crystalline palace.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I'm going
into the records,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:40.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't see a library
or books or scrolls.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:84%
I know some people
describe it that way.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.940 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's like I'm looking
for individual cosmic crystals.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking for
that person's crystal.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
open their crystal,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.660 align:middle line:84%
it's like a movie plays
and I see their story.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.640 align:middle line:90%
It's really beautiful.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By knowing what
your records are, can that

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:84%
affect your personality
or how you live your life?

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, it did
for me big time, yeah.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
traumatic for you?

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think
initially it was,

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:84%
because I was seeing past
lives where there was

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.790 align:middle line:90%
traumatic events that happened.

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But as I got more
into my records,

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I was able to heal
those aspects of myself

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:84%
that I had forgotten
about or didn't remember.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, OK, yeah,
I did that in the past.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK with it now.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to move
forward from it.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So there is healing within
the records as well.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I think how it changed my life
was it gave me the ability

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:40.220 align:middle line:84%
to know who I am, what my
certain skill sets are,

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.945 align:middle line:90%
what I came here to Earth to do.

00:26:41.945 --> 00:26:45.140 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Who my soul family is,
who am I connected with.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And it just added to the
whole tapestry of who I am.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me that
empowerment to pursue my dreams

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and to create the type of
fifth dimensional kind of life

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
create for myself.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you access
your Akashic records

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and you don't like the direction
your future may be going,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:90%
how do you change that?

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think it's a
matter of intention setting.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen future
probabilities for me--

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:22.140 align:middle line:84%
like for instance, you mentioned
my health transformation.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah dramatic, yeah.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:90%
I saw on the records--

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I almost
didn't recognize you.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I know.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Everybody says that.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
noticing, by the way.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I saw the trajectory of my life
being unhealthy, and I said,

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that in my life.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I need to make some
dramatic changes.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there an
episode, though, that made you

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:90%
decide that?

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, there was
actually several episodes.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But it was mainly the
deterioration of my health.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And also other
personal episodes.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But I asked my guides
for assistance.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, if you want
me to do the bigger

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.110 align:middle line:84%
work that-- my mission
here on this planet,

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:90%
I need to be healthy.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:90%
So I was accessing the records.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that they would
send me a sign of a solution.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I was seeing ads
for a bariatric center.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.960 align:middle line:90%
I kept seeing these ads.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Which is what you
ended up doing.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
I saw these ads.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh no, I'm not--

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I can't qualify
for bariatric surgery.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not big enough.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.800 align:middle line:84%
But I kept seeing
the ads, and I was

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, this must be the sign
they were telling me about.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:90%
So I called the office.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I met with
my bariatric surgeon,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:90%
he was very compassionate.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.022 align:middle line:84%
But I was crying, because I was
like, I tried all these diets.

00:28:47.022 --> 00:28:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing works.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Nothing works.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, we
can definitely help you.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And that just lifted my heart.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.850 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh my gosh.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had you
continued, Deborah,

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.420 align:middle line:90%
down the course you were on--

00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: -- what
would have happened?

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.985 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think I would
have had an early death.

00:29:02.985 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I think I would have continued
to have health issues.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.090 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was pre-diabetic.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.527 align:middle line:84%
I probably would have
developed diabetes.

00:29:09.527 --> 00:29:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I probably might have developed
heart disease, because I

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.350 align:middle line:90%
was having some heart issues.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Maybe had a stroke.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my health issues
were pretty extreme.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And have most of
these ills gone away now?

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.782 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I would say
the majority of them have.

00:29:22.782 --> 00:29:25.210 align:middle line:84%
The only one that hasn't
been my sleep apnea.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's definitely
improved a lot.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.008 align:middle line:84%
I think I reduced
it by half, yeah.

00:29:30.008 --> 00:29:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have to
sleep with one of those--

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.245 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Not anymore.

00:29:33.245 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you did?

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I did, yeah.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't wait to
get rid of that thing.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I was just like,
get this off of me.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you did a
tremendous metamorphosis.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Did you tap into
your Akashic records

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.450 align:middle line:90%
in order to see that change?

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, I was constantly.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I was setting intentions
in my records.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Like, I want to get to my ideal
weight, I want to be healthy,

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to have energy.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.690 align:middle line:90%
I even wanted to age-reverse.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:02.595 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:30:02.595 --> 00:30:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And I
did age-reverse.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.250 align:middle line:84%
My husband says all the time
that I age-reversed 20 years,

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.940 align:middle line:90%
which I think he's being kind.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's nice to
hear people say that.

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say when we die,
there's a book of our life.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Is that what the
Akashic records are?

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Is it that book?

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It is that book.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is that book.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.365 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It is that book.

00:30:24.365 --> 00:30:26.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the book that the
Bible was talking about,

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:90%
the Book of Life.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And they always made it seem
like a big deal in the Bible.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, if you can
access the Book of Life,

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:84%
you have mastery
over everything.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what
is this Book of Life?

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I was this
biblical student for years.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I actually went to a
Christian university.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:90%
So I had to take Bible classes.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was always wondering,
what's this Book of Life?

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I want the
access to Book of Life.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.738 align:middle line:84%
Because they made it
sound like you would

00:30:48.738 --> 00:30:51.272 align:middle line:90%
have this tremendous power.

00:30:51.272 --> 00:30:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when I realized
the Book of Life

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
was the Akashic records,
I was like, oh, OK.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
were talking about.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think the consciousness
back in the biblical days

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:90%
was different.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think there probably
wasn't very many people back

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:07.740 align:middle line:84%
in those days that could access
that type of information.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But now with our
expanded consciousness,

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:13.640 align:middle line:84%
as the Earth continues to
ascend, more and more of us

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.820 align:middle line:90%
are having that access.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the big,
unattainable thing

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.740 align:middle line:90%
that it used to be.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
huge responsibility

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:24.747 align:middle line:84%
for someone like you who reads
these records of other people?

00:31:24.747 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, yeah.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there is.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.592 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
like a caretaker.

00:31:28.592 --> 00:31:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: We're
a caretaker, yeah.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:33.635 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're dealing
with somebody memories.

00:31:33.635 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's kind of like--

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I always say I'm like
the memory jockey.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm attaching myself to
other people's memories

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.320 align:middle line:90%
or other people's soul journeys.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to tell
somebody something that's

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:90%
going to retraumatize them.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will you tell everybody
exactly what's going on?

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.750 align:middle line:90%
You don't sugarcoat anything?

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Usually I
asked their guides.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times when I'm
accessing the records, if I

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.710 align:middle line:84%
see something that's traumatic,
I'll ask their guides,

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.890 align:middle line:90%
are they ready--

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or dangerous.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, or dangerous.

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll say, can
I tell them this?

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I guess you have
an obligation to, don't you?

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It depends on what--

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.973 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I get a sense of
what the guides tell me.

00:32:15.973 --> 00:32:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So the guides will tell me,
yeah, you can tell them,

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.820 align:middle line:84%
but don't tell them
all the details.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you saw, if you
continue down this lifestyle,

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:28.660 align:middle line:84%
you're going to end up getting
arrested for bank robbery

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.660 align:middle line:90%
or something like that--

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, yeah, I'll
tell them something like that.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.413 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they react?

00:32:33.413 --> 00:32:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I had
some clients that

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.420 align:middle line:90%
weren't very happy with me.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They blame you?

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, they
might get angry with me.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They blame
you for their records.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.100 align:middle line:90%
I get some clients.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Those are the more--

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.000 align:middle line:84%
the clients that need to do a
little more work on themselves.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Most of my clients, however,
are beautiful, evolved,

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.740 align:middle line:90%
wonderful people.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to
accept information.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So I also set intentions
for the kind of clients

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I like to work with,
so I don't like

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.720 align:middle line:84%
to work with those that don't
want to do their own work.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.593 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:33:05.593 --> 00:33:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're happy
doing what you do?

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I love it.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:90%
It can be tiring.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I think what people
don't realize

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:84%
is that I can't do
eight readings in a day.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.480 align:middle line:90%
I have to really--

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's exhaustion.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.517 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: It is exhausting.

00:33:20.517 --> 00:33:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
got Edgar Cayce.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Too many readings wore him down.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It wears me down, too.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.752 align:middle line:84%
So I have to really limit
how many readings I do a day.

00:33:28.752 --> 00:33:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know people are always
wanting to book readings

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:84%
with me, and I'm like, I
can only fit so many a day.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I have to
take care of myself.

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do the recording
of the Akashic records?

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Who does that?

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:43.330 align:middle line:90%
Who puts these things in?

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think it's
automatically done.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I think the Akashic records
is like its own entity.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.330 align:middle line:84%
It just records
everything that happens.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.110 align:middle line:90%
It's like a computer program.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's an energetic
computer program.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill Foss,
again, comes back

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.210 align:middle line:84%
to tell us about the
recording of these records.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK, sounds good.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who catalogs
the things in the book?

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.870 align:middle line:90%
Who puts your record in there?

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BILL MOSS: You do.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
With the help of your spirit
guides and life events.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
So you're given options
during your life

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.670 align:middle line:84%
about the-- and your
response sometimes,

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:84%
your reaction, which
is more emotional

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:84%
or your response, on a soul
level, guides your life.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:30.225 align:middle line:84%
And your soul is guiding
through your body

00:34:30.225 --> 00:34:31.600 align:middle line:84%
through the journey
of your life.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain things
in the records that are set up.

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Much of your life is free will.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And other things in
the records, there

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:45.840 align:middle line:84%
are some things that are set up
as lessons or lifetime events

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:52.050 align:middle line:84%
for you to experience, such
as marriage or learning

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.389 align:middle line:84%
on some deep level
or great level.

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there any inaccuracy
about the book at all,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:84%
or is it everything
you've done in your life?

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: There's literally
no inaccuracy with the book,

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.170 align:middle line:84%
because the book is
not going to have--

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:12.160 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be telling
a fictional story for you.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.960 align:middle line:84%
The book is literally going
to be your truest self.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you connect
into your records,

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:23.660 align:middle line:84%
if you connect into your Book
of Life, you're going to get--

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.100 align:middle line:90%
it's like looking in the mirror.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.810 align:middle line:90%
The mirror doesn't lie.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He just said something
very interesting, Deb,

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and that is, you put
these into your records.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.822 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, no, I think
I could relate to that.

00:35:34.822 --> 00:35:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You agree with that?

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I agree with that.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At this point?

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.045 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:35:38.045 --> 00:35:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think so.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's our
higher self, maybe not

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.310 align:middle line:90%
our Earth avatar self.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:84%
But our higher self and
our higher guidance that's

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:90%
connected to source records.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And I like what he said about
that you set certain parameters

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:84%
within your records that
you're supposed to accomplish.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Like, for instance,
in my own records,

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I was supposed to have
a successful romantic

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.760 align:middle line:84%
relationship that was--
and that was so hard for me

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.410 align:middle line:90%
to do for most much of my life.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:11.915 align:middle line:84%
I was like the poster child
for dysfunctional relationships

00:36:11.915 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But I finally met
somebody wonderful.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.115 align:middle line:90%
I've been with him for 19 years.

00:36:19.115 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a nice run.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And then I
was able to accomplish

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.080 align:middle line:90%
one of those goals.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.862 align:middle line:84%
So I think there are certain
parameters or certain goals

00:36:26.862 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:84%
that we set for ourselves
throughout our lives.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Certain lessons that
we have to learn.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I love that when he
said about that, yeah.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had
somebody access their records

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and simply say to you, I don't
like who I'm going to become.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.590 align:middle line:90%
And I want to change.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:44.035 align:middle line:90%
Does that ever happen?

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I don't think
I've ever had that happen.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they not being
honest with themselves?

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: No, I
think usually what

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:56.730 align:middle line:84%
happens is somebody
might say, well, maybe I

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.280 align:middle line:84%
don't like what I
am now, but I think

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I would like to get
some input from my guide

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.230 align:middle line:90%
so I can make some changes.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it subject
to interpretation?

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely, yeah.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:08.970 align:middle line:90%
It can be.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:11.553 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You see and what I see
could be two different things,

00:37:11.553 --> 00:37:12.360 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, that's
something that I usually

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.670 align:middle line:84%
try to explain to my clients
when I'm working with them,

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:21.060 align:middle line:84%
is this might just be
my frame of reference.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm looking at a
movie, right, in the records.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:28.125 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's just
a frame of reference

00:37:28.125 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:90%
on how I'm interpreting.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times, we
might be accessing the records,

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.230 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we don't recognize
the type of culture

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking at.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe we don't have
enough information about it.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of times,
I'm trying to get--

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.230 align:middle line:84%
it's like a
multilayered process.

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting
information audibly,

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:50.580 align:middle line:84%
you're getting
information visually,

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.420 align:middle line:84%
you're getting information
clairsentiently.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to get
additional information,

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.303 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I just have to
use my frame of reference.

00:37:59.303 --> 00:38:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, I'll
explain that to my clients.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Like, this just might
be my interpretation,

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.070 align:middle line:90%
but this is what I'm seeing.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we had 10
reincarnated lives,

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.980 align:middle line:84%
would all those
reincarnated lives

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.630 align:middle line:90%
be in the Akashic records?

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely, yeah.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, yeah.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.710 align:middle line:90%
It just keeps recording.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And it even records
parallel lives,

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.720 align:middle line:84%
it records lives in
other dimensions.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.355 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it records
on so many levels.

00:38:24.355 --> 00:38:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, when I'm
doing a reading for somebody,

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm also accessing parallel
lives or walk-in experiences.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just a vast
array of experiences.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And so you're having to
navigate through all of that.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So what's your
actual incarnation,

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.460 align:middle line:90%
and what's a parallel life?

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's always happening
along the way, too.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm picturing a guy
in a white beard with a big pen

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.400 align:middle line:84%
writing these things in the
book, going, this, and this,

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.750 align:middle line:90%
and this is this.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go in
that way, does it?

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: No.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.790 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's like a
camera or a recording.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I know I go back to
Netflix, but it's

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.460 align:middle line:84%
like accessing a
movie on Netflix

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.900 align:middle line:90%
and you just open it up.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you're following
along the movie.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, though, when
we're accessing the records,

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.360 align:middle line:84%
there's so much vast
information that you'll

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.660 align:middle line:90%
get 10 or 20 movies.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it's all different
aspects of this person's life.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And it takes, I think, a
skilled reader to zero in on,

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:31.020 align:middle line:84%
what's the more prevalent or
what's the more relevant movies

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that you need to follow
rather than trying

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.470 align:middle line:90%
to access them all at once.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it so important
for us to access these records?

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.400 align:middle line:10%
>>SOLARIS: I think it
gives us a guideline

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:47.930 align:middle line:10%
to navigate through our lives.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a map, OK.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And I think a lot--

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.160 align:middle line:90%
it's like a map.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.050 align:middle line:10%
So if you have an
idea of, oh, OK, this

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.900 align:middle line:10%
is what I did in
these past lives,

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.690 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to do that again--

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:05.540 align:middle line:10%
you're not repeating the same
mistakes over and over again.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.830 align:middle line:10%
You have an opportunity to--

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:08.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: For us to learn
by these mistakes, right.

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.940 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to learn
by them, absolutely.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Deb, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Thank
you for having me.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.728 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always had
an affinity for Egypt.

00:40:15.728 --> 00:40:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Now we know why, don't we?

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: We sure do.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Access your Akashic records.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.540 align:middle line:10%
Find out who you were
and who you will become.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.810 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
