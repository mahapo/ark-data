00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:10%
You know, there is no topic
that really strikes home for me

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:10%
than the subject of
extraterrestrials'

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.030 align:middle line:10%
artifacts on other
planets and other systems.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And we have a very special
guest today, Billy Carson.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Billy has been investigating
for years now the possibility

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
of anomalies throughout
the solar system, perhaps

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
on other planets outside
the solar system as well.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Billy, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BILLY CARSON: Thank you.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be here.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You, many years ago,
formed a very interesting

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:90%
organization.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: We'll, we're
called the United

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:10%
Family of Anomaly Hunters.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:10%
And it's a group of 14
of us that came together.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:10%
We had already been researching
official NASA and European

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:10%
Space Agency documents
and images from many years

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:10%
separately.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.694 align:middle line:10%
When I started getting involved
with this group I said,

00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:10%
look guys, we'd be better
if we come together,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:10%
coalesce into one
giant organization

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:10%
and then focus all of
our energy into one place

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:10%
so that we can actually rub
things off of each other.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Get opinions whether
this looks real

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:84%
or that looks fake or is
this really there or not.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:10%
And it's people from all
different genres and people

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:10%
from all around the world.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:84%
We've really done a
phenomenal job, I think,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:84%
in coming together
and exposing anomalies

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.177 align:middle line:90%
that are out there in space.

00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:35.551 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're like the United
Nations of anomalies now.

00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Brilliant idea.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.363 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the contribution
of all these people, have they

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:90%
enhanced what you do?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, absolutely,
significantly.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Because at first
it was just myself

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.752 align:middle line:84%
looking through
mostly Mars images,

00:01:48.752 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
because there was a
lot of data from Mars

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
because we've sent the
majority of the probes

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.450 align:middle line:90%
to Mars and rovers to Mars.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
But now when I started reaching
out and tapping into people

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.300 align:middle line:84%
that were researching
the moons of Jupiter,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
the moons of Saturn, our
moon itself, and even earth

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:84%
anomalies, megalithic
structures around the planet,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.504 align:middle line:84%
I began to see a
much bigger picture.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And I started seeing how
all these anomalies kind of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:90%
tied together.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:84%
They appeared to have
the same architect.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.591 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Billy, when
you talk about anomalies

00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
from images, are we
talking about looking

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:90%
at pictures sent back to us?

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:90%
What are you looking at?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.454 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We're
looking at images

00:02:23.454 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that are sent back to us from
space probes and rovers that

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:90%
are on Mars, for example.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And also
the Huygens probe,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:90%
which went out to Saturn.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:10%
So these images are official
images from official sources,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:10%
from NASA, the European Space
Agency, the Russian Space

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:10%
Agency, we even
images from there.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:10%
The Indian Space agency also
now have now recently gone out

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:10%
and sent an actual
satellite to Mars.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now does
NASA, for example,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
really understand what they're
sending out to the public?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.004 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you
get this information?

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, it's
publicly available.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Because fortunately
for us, our taxes

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:90%
help fund this and pay for it.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
At first, they weren't
releasing the images.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah-ha.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.784 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They
were holding back.

00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:04.734 align:middle line:84%
And then, I forget the
name of the senator,

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
but there was a senator
that said, look,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.024 align:middle line:84%
if you don't release
these images we're

00:03:08.024 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:90%
going to file suit.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We own them, right?

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: We own them.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Other people came
behind him, civilians,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:84%
citizens of the world and said,
look, we want these images

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:90%
or we're going to file.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So eventually it became
such a big problem

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.536 align:middle line:84%
they say OK, let's start
releasing the images.

00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So one day they released
like 500,000 at once.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And then from there it started
coming in on a constant stream,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:90%
images coming down.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Very low quality compared
to what I think they

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:84%
really have, but they have
been releasing the images.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly though,
they don't spell out

00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:90%
what the images show.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:90%
You have to look for that.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You have
to look for it.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a very detailed process.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean literally getting
out a real magnifying glass,

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
bringing the image down
into a photo program

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually analyze,
taking away some of the haze,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and really going almost
centimeter by centimeter

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.301 align:middle line:84%
looking for out
of place objects.

00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
important thing.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to say
it's this, and we

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.376 align:middle line:90%
don't want to say it's that.

00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
All we can say is that this
particular object that we're

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
looking at in this image doesn't
appear to match the surrounding

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:90%
terrain.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.138 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And that's what
an anomaly is for us.

00:04:05.138 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And overall,
what kind of anomalies

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:90%
are we talking about?

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We're talking about
a lot of structural anomalies,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.270 align:middle line:90%
mostly.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Structural meaning that
they appear to have

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:90%
walls, remnants of buildings.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
You can even see
in some images what

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.900 align:middle line:90%
appear to be tops of roofs.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Doors.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So pretty good size.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Pretty good size.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Some are super massive
and some are small.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:84%
We've seen some structures
as high as three

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.037 align:middle line:84%
and four miles off of the
surface of the planet.

00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.286 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And we've seen some
structures just a few inches

00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:90%
off the surface of the planet.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But they are truly
interesting objects

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:84%
that have geometry and
have what we would consider

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.984 align:middle line:84%
to be recognizable traits of
things we would see on Earth.

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you look
at these objects and these

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:84%
structures, clearly
you say to yourself,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.454 align:middle line:84%
this cannot be made
by Mother Nature.

00:04:50.454 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Right,
that's the thing.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.828 align:middle line:84%
And now, Mother Nature
does have the capability

00:04:53.828 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:84%
of making geometric
shapes or 90 degree

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:84%
angles in certain
situations with crystals

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.652 align:middle line:90%
and different rock formations.

00:04:59.652 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:84%
But what we're seeing is
something totally different.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the main
reasons why we decided to form,

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.900 align:middle line:90%
to come together as a group.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So that we can actually bounce
a lot of the information off

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.119 align:middle line:84%
of each other and say, OK, based
on your technique of finding

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:14.910 align:middle line:84%
these anomalies, how
does this look to you?

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this is a structure
that may or may not be there?

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, people have different
ways of analyzing the images.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us a better
idea, collectively,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:84%
of whether to say
OK to the public,

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.080 align:middle line:84%
this is one thing that
we think is an anomaly.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.334 align:middle line:84%
Very often we find things
that turn out to be nothing.

00:05:29.334 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing, of course.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But we do find quite
a few that have turned out

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.905 align:middle line:90%
to be real anomalies.

00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you look at the
small fossil records too?

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.176 align:middle line:84%
Or just primarily are you
looking for structures?

00:05:37.176 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We do look
at fossil records.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a very interesting
term you just used.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
the anomalies we

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.460 align:middle line:84%
discover on Mars appear to
be bones, not actual rocks.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's one particular
image in McMurdo Valley that was

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:90%
taken by the Opportunity Rover.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
entire little area,

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
which is about maybe 20 meters,
has quite a few bones there.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, dozens-- what
appear to be bones.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.438 align:middle line:84%
I can't say they're
bones for sure.

00:06:05.438 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But they appear to be femurs
and just little bits of bones

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Very, very interesting.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.422 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any bones of what you
would think to be humans or you

00:06:14.422 --> 00:06:15.222 align:middle line:90%
know, somebody--

00:06:15.222 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Humanoid?

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.649 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --that looks like us?

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: One of the most famous
images that we've discovered

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.114 align:middle line:84%
was by Martine Grainey, of one
of our Anomaly Hunter groups.

00:06:24.114 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of
your team members.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:90%
She runs Martian Genesis.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:10%
And she actually
has a very clear--

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:10%
and this made international
news-- picture

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.172 align:middle line:10%
of two humanoids laying
together on the ground

00:06:35.172 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:10%
kind of at an angle as
if they were blown over.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:10%
And maybe have passed away or
deceased right there on Mars

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:10%
with their garbs,
their clothes on.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.078 align:middle line:84%
You can see their fingers,
their hands, the face, the eyes,

00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:90%
the nose, even the eyelashes.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: All there.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like one of those--

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huddled together?

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Huddled together.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And appeared to have died
right there in that spot.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.051 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like some
of the things we're

00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:84%
hearing from Pompeii after
that volcano exploded,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Mount Vesuvius.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That some of the
people were huddled together

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and died instantly when the
molted ash and everything else

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:90%
came down on them.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like--

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Very similar.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very similar.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Very, very similar.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.361 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously evidence
of a major catastrophe

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:90%
on Mars, geologically.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:90%
That's not without a doubt.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody knows
that now in science.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.916 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But this, you are
absolutely right about Pompeii

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even now the Indus
Valley in Mohenjo-daro where

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
there's still bodies laying
in the street holding hands.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And even the animals
won't scavenge them

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.814 align:middle line:84%
because the bodies
are still radioactive.

00:07:28.814 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After
looking at what you

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
did on Mars, what have
you concluded about what

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:90%
might have happened there?

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I concluded that there
may be two situations on Mars.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
One appears to possibly
be a major pole

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
shift of the crust
of the planet itself.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And there obviously is the
asteroid belt right outside

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:90%
of Mars.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.006 align:middle line:84%
That asteroid belt
appears to have

00:07:47.006 --> 00:07:49.419 align:middle line:84%
been a super massive
planet in ancient times,

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:50.960 align:middle line:84%
super ancient,
millions of years ago.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That
might have exploded.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:90%
And one side of that--

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that Mars originally
was a moon of this planet.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.410 align:middle line:90%
And one side of Mars is charred.

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was the
side that took the explosion.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And when that mass
hit Mars, I think

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
it shifted the crust
of the planet itself.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Instantly,
within minutes.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:90%
That was a major catastrophe.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Then I think millions of years
later it started to come back.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But then I believe that
there were wars on Mars.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:10%
There seems to be a lot
of evidence of destruction

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:10%
that may not be as geological
as before in the past.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sounds familiar
to where we've been

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:10%
and where we could go.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.764 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:08:29.764 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When the
images come in, Billy,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
they go to Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.072 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they do
a lot of analysis there.

00:08:37.072 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: The colors that
you're showing in these images,

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:44.252 align:middle line:10%
are they natural color
or white balance color?

00:08:44.252 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL MALIN: You want
me to answer one at a time?

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.690 align:middle line:10%
They are not white balance.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:10%
They're what the
camera sent back.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:10%
I just brighten it up because
the illumination in Mars

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:10%
is much less than at Earth.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:10%
And we were concerned
when we set the exposures

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.690 align:middle line:10%
to be able to make
sure that if there

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:10%
was something glinting that we
didn't saturate the detector.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:10%
So the images were
pretty underexposed

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.542 align:middle line:10%
for a normal photographer.

00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:10%
So I just brightened them up.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:10%
And that's just what the
bare filter gives you

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.584 align:middle line:10%
when you look at Mars.

00:09:13.584 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now that of
course, is Michael Malin.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And he's got his own company
that does a lot of work

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:90%
with NASA.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.149 align:middle line:84%
Why would colors be
so important on Mars?

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, one of the most
important things that I think

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.314 align:middle line:84%
people need to
understand is that a lot

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
of the imagery coming back
from Mars has red filters

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and white balancing
put into them.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they doctored?

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They're doctored.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.373 align:middle line:10%
There's no doubt about it.

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:37.226 align:middle line:10%
You can actually see, without
using any type of technology,

00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:10%
without using
magnifying glasses,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.474 align:middle line:10%
you can actually see
parts of the images that

00:09:40.474 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:10%
are obfuscated purposefully.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, the image
starts out phenomenally clear.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And you get to a part where you
go, I think I see something.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
it's obfuscated.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.521 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's
blurred intentionally.

00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Things are turned into
to look like rocks

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:90%
when they're not really rocks.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you simply take
the Burn tool from Photoshop

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:90%
and start rubbing it on there.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.016 align:middle line:84%
And you start burning
through that fake layer

00:10:01.016 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:84%
that they put on, you can
see what's underneath it.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost as if that
NASA is telling people,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.775 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
alter these things.

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:09.233 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, I
believe that they

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
have a team of
probably even some very

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated software.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:10%
Even on the Rover
deck itself, when

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:10%
you read the technical
specs, it has

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.804 align:middle line:10%
the capability of running
software balancing out,

00:10:19.804 --> 00:10:22.220 align:middle line:10%
what they call "balancing out"
the images before they even

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:10%
transmit it to the satellite
and then back to Earth.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
they're transmitting,

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
or they're showing the public
very low quality images.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The camera is supposedly
a two megapixel camera.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Which is-- I mean,
that's extremely low.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why would you send a
$2.5 billion rover to a planet

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.825 align:middle line:90%
with a two megapixel camera?

00:10:40.825 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.410 align:middle line:90%
We don't even use those here.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: No, our cell
phones are 10 megapixels.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, come on.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At least.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe that they
have a much better camera.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.151 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's the truth.

00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're giving us two
megapixel images sometimes,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.450 align:middle line:90%
only sometimes.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time it's
less than two megapixels.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gees.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And you have to
really go in and really analyze

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:90%
these images very carefully.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:84%
They do have a couple of
different cameras on deck.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.590 align:middle line:90%
They have the MAHLI.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:10%
They have the two
Mastcam cameras.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:10%
And they also have
something called a KAI-2020,

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.676 align:middle line:10%
which takes a 720p HD video.

00:11:13.676 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Which we've never
seen any video.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they've got it.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They've got the video.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.209 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are they
holding back on us, Billy?

00:11:19.209 --> 00:11:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they want us to say,
look at what we've discovered.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:90%
There are structures on Mars.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:90%
There are artifacts there.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Look at what we've found.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they do that?

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Because it's all
about control and power.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
You see, once you tell
people that there's

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
a remnant of an ancient
civilization on a planet

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and we found these
remnants, now you

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
have to share this
information with the world.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And that
means you've got

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.541 align:middle line:90%
to share whatever you discover.

00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Technology wise,
maybe they're really

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
researching this war
that appears to have

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:90%
happened on this planet.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.514 align:middle line:84%
And now all of a sudden it's
a security risk in their eyes.

00:11:55.514 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that they'd
like to be way

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.400 align:middle line:90%
ahead of the game at all times.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want anybody to
know that there is something

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.796 align:middle line:84%
there, that there maybe even
potentially could be a threat

00:12:02.796 --> 00:12:04.582 align:middle line:90%
to back to Earth from there.

00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe that they're going
there on a Christopher Columbus

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
type of excursion to really
take over what's left.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just a
very strange situation.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they really
are looking to cover up.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And will only give out
tiny bits of disclosure

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:90%
over a very long period of time.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody, Billy,
somewhere, within agencies,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
has seen these
incredible images.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And has seen the images
we don't get to see.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Images that even
you don't get to see

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:84%
because of the deterioration
of the pictures.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When do they go public?

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:84%
When does somebody like
that decide to say,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to Billy Carson and
I'm telling him everything.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:90%
It that going to happen?

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.373 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It might happen.

00:12:49.373 --> 00:12:52.400 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest problem you
have is the NASA scientists

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:90%
that are dying.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
In the last 10 years, over
200 NASA scientists are dead.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you mean, dead?

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Gone.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strangely?

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Strangely.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Car accidents, ski
slope accidents.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.364 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Two hundred?

00:13:07.364 --> 00:13:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Two hundred.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.887 align:middle line:90%
It's a really big list.

00:13:09.887 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And every single one you read
of you're going, you know,

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.970 align:middle line:84%
drove off the side
of a mountain.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is bizarre.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's
extremely bizarre.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Different types of weird
cancers that just pop up.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have so many
of these NASA scientists

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:90%
literally just dying.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.844 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of horrifying.

00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the people
who may want to come out

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:90%
are afraid to, you know, to die.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now a
conspiracy expert would

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
say that they are being
killed off for some reason.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:35.604 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:13:35.604 --> 00:13:37.979 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If that's true,
what's that reason?

00:13:37.979 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The reason would be
not to get this information out

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Because they have their own
timed level of disclosure

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:90%
that they want to put out.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.842 align:middle line:90%
They just released OK--

00:13:45.842 --> 00:13:48.300 align:middle line:84%
at first they were saying that
Mars was a cold, dead place.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.477 align:middle line:84%
Then they came out a few
years ago and said, oh--

00:13:50.477 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It has
oceans, it had oceans.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The temperature
at the equator

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:53.918 align:middle line:90%
is 90 degrees at the equator.

00:13:53.918 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Now it has water and lakes
and potentially small oceans

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:90%
or small seas, I would say.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:84%
They show a picture
of mountains on Mars

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:84%
with water coming down
the mountain on TV.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
going to come in 2020

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:84%
with this next particular
Rover going out,

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.389 align:middle line:84%
I think they're going to
announce that there's bacteria.

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:11.430 align:middle line:90%
You know, bacterial life.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is life.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Which is life.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So they will
make that announcement.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.826 align:middle line:84%
And then I believe from
there, over many more years,

00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
they'll get to more insects
and then maybe into mammals.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.575 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, Elon Musk and
his crew will be there.

00:14:22.575 --> 00:14:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be the
Christopher Columbus

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:84%
like they're the first
explorers discovering things.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will they hold back?

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: No, they're going.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.609 align:middle line:84%
But I think they're the front
for something even bigger.

00:14:33.609 --> 00:14:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think they're
going to tell us, though?

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I think no.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
going to tell us.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
going to tell us the truth.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I think everything has been
signed and agreed upon.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.737 align:middle line:84%
I love Elon Musk
and I love SpaceX.

00:14:42.737 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:90%
I love what they're doing.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, hopefully
they'll say something.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.803 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Maybe somebody will
leak some information out.

00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when you
talk about oceans on Mars,

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:84%
they were Earth-like
weren't they?

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.743 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, they're
very Earth-like.

00:14:53.743 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We now know that Mars was wet
for a much longer time than we

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:90%
thought before.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Curiosity shows it was wet
for 1 and 1/2 billion years,

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:84%
already much longer
than the period of time

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:84%
needed for life to
develop on Earth.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And now, we see that Mars must
have been wet for a period

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:90%
even longer.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It's fascinating that we can
learn so much about 4.5 billion

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:84%
years ago when measurements
are taken right now.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately, we
can conclude this idea

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:10%
of an ocean covering
20% of the planet, which

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:10%
opens the idea of habitability
and the evolution of life

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.289 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:15:28.289 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting to me.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because if
you have liquid water,

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's somewhat warm,
you're going to have life.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's just natural.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Just natural.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing when you
look at a lot of these images

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
from Mars, you
actually can see what

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.412 align:middle line:84%
appear to be algae and different
types of small plant life.

00:15:43.412 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't see any massive
trees or anything like that

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
until you get to the
north and south pole.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:84%
There are actual images of
what appear to be pine trees.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Now it could be an illusion.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:90%
But they appear to be trees.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they don't look
like rock formations, do they?

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.989 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They don't look
like rock formations at all.

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And they appear to
be you know, snow all

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:90%
around them at the base.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And then trees that
are standing up

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:90%
off the surface of the planet.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Alive?

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.207 align:middle line:90%
Still alive or petrified?

00:16:05.207 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: No, still alive.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:90%
These appear to be very alive.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: At the
north and south pole.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
there are critters

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:90%
running around the planet?

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I believe
that there actually are.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.469 align:middle line:84%
My personal opinion, some
of the things that I've seen

00:16:15.469 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:90%
appear to be.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like rodents
and things like?

00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:18.640 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Little rodents.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why I think
that they appear to be alive

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:10%
is because based on where
the camera from the Mastcam

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:10%
from the Rovers looking to
take that picture, the object,

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.350 align:middle line:10%
the anomaly, appears to be
looking back at the camera.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So if it was a statue
or something like that,

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.330 align:middle line:84%
why would it be
looking at the camera?

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.496 align:middle line:90%
And this happens many times.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.360 align:middle line:84%
You see these
anomalies that appear

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
to be biological organisms
always looking directly

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:90%
at the camera.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.394 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're bent at an
angle and turning to look,

00:16:44.394 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:84%
but they're looking
at the camera.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.264 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really bizarre.

00:16:47.264 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy Mars and
Earth, they're very similar.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it formed at the same
time, the same complexity.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.490 align:middle line:84%
They had water, they
had oceans, temperatures

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:90%
were about the same.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
There's no question in my mind
that life on Earth and life

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:90%
on Mars may be very similar.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.916 align:middle line:84%
Did Mars have a civilization
much like Earth did?

00:17:06.916 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I really
believe that it did.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.956 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
is because when

00:17:09.956 --> 00:17:12.410 align:middle line:84%
you go into some of the
ancient text, the Mahabharata,

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
the Bhagavad Gita, some
of the Indian Vedas,

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and also the Sumerian
tablets, you discover

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:90%
that they had apparently--

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was like an
interplanetary civilization.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:84%
They would travel
from Earth to Mars.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:90%
People were on Mars.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And according to even
the Annunaki epic,

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
there were people on Mars called
the Igigi that were actually

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:90%
mining Mars for resources.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.302 align:middle line:84%
And they would then take those
resources back to their home

00:17:36.302 --> 00:17:37.510 align:middle line:90%
planet, wherever that may be.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.857 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
communication back and forth.

00:17:40.857 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And even in some of the
cylinder scrolls its shows earth

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and Mars with this winged disk
with a funny emblem on it.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And it
appears to be that might

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
have been even the communication
piece between the two planets.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that was the
Black Knight Satellite,

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.683 align:middle line:84%
which is still hovering
above our heads right now.

00:17:55.683 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, I believe
from these ancient texts they

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.184 align:middle line:90%
describe these trips there.

00:17:59.184 --> 00:18:01.469 align:middle line:84%
And that these people were
there and we were here.

00:18:01.469 --> 00:18:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And a few whistle
blowers have come forward

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and said that the
people on Mars looked

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:90%
like the ancient Egyptians.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who came first?

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.919 align:middle line:90%
Martians or Earthlings?

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think that
the Earthlings came first.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.341 align:middle line:84%
And then later, because in
the Epoch of the Anunnaki,

00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
when you read that
information about the tablets

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:84%
where the Igigi were fed up with
working in slave labor on Mars,

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.839 align:middle line:84%
they actually came to
Earth and took some females

00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
to take back to Mars with
them, because they even

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:90%
had no females there.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:10%
So I think they took
some Earth humans back,

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.270 align:middle line:10%
which may be the
reference in Genesis 6

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.040 align:middle line:10%
where they came here
and took those women

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:10%
and made them into their wives
and took them back to Mars.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That could be.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:10%
That could be.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.990 align:middle line:84%
The interpretation
of Genesis, if you

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.650 align:middle line:84%
look at it toward an
extraterrestrial presence,

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:43.700 align:middle line:90%
makes a lot of sense.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.657 align:middle line:84%
The angels could have
been ETs, for example.

00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I believe.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Nephilim,
those that came down here.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, that may
have taken the Earth women

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:90%
and taken them off the planet.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So they must have looked
pretty similar to what we look.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think that we
look like them, according

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:middle line:84%
to what I've studied so far
and research, and a lot of the

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.204 align:middle line:90%
lectures that I've been to.

00:19:01.204 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've discovered
that it appears

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that somehow at
some point in time,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.040 align:middle line:84%
the already evolving
hominid on this planet

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.290 align:middle line:84%
was genetically modified
to a certain point

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.366 align:middle line:90%
to come to a certain level of--

00:19:14.366 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say it--
but you know, become

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.769 align:middle line:84%
a slave, a genetic
slave to these beings.

00:19:19.769 --> 00:19:21.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The theory
of Zecharia Sitchin.

00:19:21.435 --> 00:19:22.851 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Right,
Zecharia Sitchin.

00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And even now, other many
researchers that have come out

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and kind of really discovered
the same information.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if the
human race, unfortunately,

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:84%
was designed to
become a slave race.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.874 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that in the
very, very beginning that

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:90%
was the whole purpose of it.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to Mars, Billy?

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.396 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well you
know, they call

00:19:41.396 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:90%
it the God of War for a reason.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And I really do
believe that they

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:84%
found a lot of traces of
nuclear war in the sand there.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: This has come forward
by a few scientists now.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can even find it
in the radio spectrometry

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:84%
from satellites and so
forth that it appears

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.470 align:middle line:84%
to have been a war or
something that would give off

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.127 align:middle line:90%
this nuclear signature.

00:19:59.127 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking that they're
calling this place the God

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.900 align:middle line:90%
of War for a specific reason.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.797 align:middle line:84%
That there really was
an interplanetary war.

00:20:04.797 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
In some of the ancient
texts, it talks

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
about a pyramid war
that was going on

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:90%
between these Anunnaki.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.240 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just on Earth.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.060 align:middle line:84%
It was between Earth,
the moon, and Mars.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.549 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that Mars got
the worst of the whole thing.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Mars and our moon got the
worst of it, I believe.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.756 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't you'd
love to be in a time machine

00:20:20.756 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and go back and just witness
some of these things?

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.536 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, it
would be amazing.

00:20:24.536 --> 00:20:26.120 align:middle line:90%
I dream about it all the time.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've
practiced remote viewing

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.290 align:middle line:84%
just so I can try to
get the opportunity

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.632 align:middle line:84%
to maybe see some of the
experiences that have actually

00:20:32.632 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:84%
happened back then
and some of the things

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:90%
that may have happened.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:84%
But the research material
is so abundant now for us,

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:84%
we can really paint ourselves
a pretty good picture.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
We may not all be
exactly correct.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin's story maybe
off here, you know.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.286 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's story's got a
little bit something off.

00:20:48.286 --> 00:20:49.085 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:49.085 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But the
underlying story, I believe,

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.237 align:middle line:90%
is pretty much all the same.

00:20:53.237 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about Venus?

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Venus?

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.191 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think the
planet of Venus might sustain?

00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Venus is
absolutely amazing.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.428 align:middle line:84%
The Magellan mission
to Venus in the 1980s

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.052 align:middle line:84%
sent back some
incredible radar images.

00:21:05.052 --> 00:21:06.218 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Old technology too.

00:21:06.218 --> 00:21:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Old technology,
old technology

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that sent back-- because they
used radar because they wanted

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:90%
to penetrate the thick clouds.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we got back is
absolutely astonishing.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
The images show the surface
structures on Venus.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can literally
see cities there.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: You can
see as if you were

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.497 align:middle line:10%
in a plane that was
70, 80,000 feet up

00:21:27.497 --> 00:21:28.580 align:middle line:10%
and you were looking down.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Old cities
or current cities?

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I can't say that
they look that they're old.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't see destruction.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Now I could be wrong.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.864 align:middle line:90%
But what I see is intact cities.

00:21:38.864 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
if they were old,

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
they would crumble
just from erosion.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, you
would see only a third

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
of a building, a quarter
of a building, you know.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.194 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't see tops of roofs.

00:21:48.194 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:84%
But from that angle
from the radar

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.560 align:middle line:84%
imagery which mapped
the entire planet,

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:90%
you see cities everywhere.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:90%
And you see tops.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Which is very bizarre.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.263 align:middle line:84%
Because when you go to Mars
and you look at the imagery,

00:21:59.263 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
you see one third
high structures,

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.470 align:middle line:84%
2/3 high structures,
quarter high structure,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.315 align:middle line:84%
but you don't see any
tops, very few tops.

00:22:05.315 --> 00:22:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Most of the images
you see a lot of flood damage.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do these
cities look like?

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They actually
look like modern day cities

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.035 align:middle line:84%
you would just
see here on Earth.

00:22:13.035 --> 00:22:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Skyscrapers?

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: New York,
yeah, skyscrapers.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Tall buildings.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.225 align:middle line:90%
Bays, it's a very--

00:22:21.225 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:90%
listen, it's amazing.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And people will go, well, it's
impossible to have something

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:24.680 align:middle line:90%
on Venus.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people
don't know that the Venera

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.436 align:middle line:84%
Mission from Russia
went to Venus 16 times.

00:22:29.436 --> 00:22:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That landed there.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Landed there.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:90%
They went there 16 times, OK.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And it is the old, NASA says
it's so hot, there's scolding

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:90%
heat, thousands of degrees.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can survive it.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, how can you land with a
parachute, fabric parachute,

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.145 align:middle line:90%
16 times on Venus?

00:22:44.145 --> 00:22:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
functions when it hits.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.186 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Thank
you, it functions.

00:22:47.186 --> 00:22:48.622 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
I think it was

00:22:48.622 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Venera 14 that sent
back an image of what

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:84%
looked like a land
crab on the surface.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:84%
In one image it's
here, next image

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:84%
it moves, another
image it's here.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Then in the fourth
image it's gone.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.280 align:middle line:10%
And the explanation that
we got back from NASA

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:10%
was that they think a lens
cap fell off of the lander.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:10%
But people don't know that
there's 16 missions to Venus

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:09.750 align:middle line:10%
already.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's pop back to Mars.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Something happened
to their atmosphere.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had
it, it was gone.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.820 align:middle line:90%
What do you think happened?

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think
that in the last war

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.150 align:middle line:84%
that they really bombed
that planet significantly.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of those
bombs created such a hole

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.550 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere that let
a lot of the gases escape,

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even rocked
the crust, which

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:90%
may have already been unstable.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:32.840 align:middle line:90%
It may have hit--

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:90%
But it went fast.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.586 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It went very fast.

00:23:35.586 --> 00:23:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Hit it in a way which
had another shift.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Tom van Flandern,
he stated that he

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:84%
thought there were two
shifts of the crust of Mars.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And I came to the same
conclusion just based

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:90%
on all that history.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And this more recent war
seems to have maybe given it

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:84%
its second crustal shift, pole
shift of the crust itself.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Which would have
caused the mountains

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:90%
to collapse into the oceans.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the oceans would
have over flooded the land.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And the atmosphere would have
definitely fled the planet.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
SpaceX and Elon Musk.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:90%
He just loves space projects.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:90%
He's one of a kind.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:10.550 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ELON MUSK: What I really
want to try to achieve here

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:90%
is to make Mars seem possible.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Make it seem as though
it's something that we

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:90%
can do in our lifetimes.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.526 align:middle line:90%
And that you can go.

00:24:21.526 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:84%
There are really two
fundamental paths.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
History is going to bifurcate
along two directions.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.670 align:middle line:84%
One path is we stay
on Earth forever.

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The alternative is to become
a spacefaring civilization

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:90%
and a multi-planet species.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Which I hope you would agree,
that is the right way to go.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think, Billy,
people like Elon Musk

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:44.670 align:middle line:84%
are just so important
to where we're going

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.239 align:middle line:90%
to head with our space program.

00:24:46.239 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Absolutely, I mean,
in my opinion there's two space

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:84%
programs, the
Secret Space Program

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the
main space program.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The one we
think is going on.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.280 align:middle line:84%
He's part of the
one that is more

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:90%
in the face of the population.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:90%
And thankfully so.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Because he's actually
pushing things

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
in a direction to wake people
up to the fact that we are,

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:90%
our birthright is space.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Our birthright is space travel
and populating other planets.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And we actually do
need to populate

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:84%
other planets to sustain
ourselves and the human race.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you know,
there will come a time

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
where this planet potentially
could face destruction.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't know when.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.950 align:middle line:84%
But it has happened in
the past, and it possibly

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:90%
can happen again in the future.

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So I love what he's done, and
loved a lot of the innovations

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that he's been able to do
with limited technology.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Meaning not limited to
mean he's not advanced,

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
but I mean compared to
some of the technologies

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.990 align:middle line:84%
that we know are
potentially available,

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
he's maximized what
has been allowed.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I really give my
hat's off to that.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wants a civilization
on Mars, doesn't he?

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yes, he
does, I believe so.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:44.580 align:middle line:90%
And he will get it.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I think there's already a
breakaway civilization there,

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
that has possibly been
there for a very long time.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.918 align:middle line:84%
I think there's an
infrastructure already being

00:25:51.918 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:84%
developed on Mars for many
years by people from Earth.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.065 align:middle line:84%
Not by aliens or
nothing like that,

00:25:58.065 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:90%
but from people from Earth.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that is
a very small remnant

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.298 align:middle line:84%
of a breakaway civilization
there that has been established

00:26:03.298 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and has already been
making way for missions

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.560 align:middle line:90%
like this in the future.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Other people like
Elon Musk pushing to do this?

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or is he like
way ahead of everybody?

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.043 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: He's way ahead,
but there's other people

00:26:15.043 --> 00:26:16.230 align:middle line:90%
that are looking to do this.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.626 align:middle line:84%
Virgin Galactic, Branson,
he's very interested.

00:26:19.626 --> 00:26:21.750 align:middle line:84%
He's got two ships that
he's built now, spaceships.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:84%
That he's looking
to make missions

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.387 align:middle line:84%
that can go and come back
from different places.

00:26:25.387 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
His first one,
unfortunately, crashed.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But he's already working,
got his second one up now

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:90%
and testing.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I like his mission because
he's got a vehicle that's

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:90%
designed to go and come back.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.200 align:middle line:90%
I want to come back.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you also have
Bigelow Aerospace.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Bob Bigelow's been doing this.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wants a hotel
up there, doesn't he?

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.165 align:middle line:84%
That's what he's
trying to build.

00:26:46.165 --> 00:26:47.850 align:middle line:10%
He's building a
space platform that's

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:10%
going to be larger than the ISS.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that he's going
to work along with probably

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.230 align:middle line:10%
Branson and Elon Musk at
SpaceX to transport people

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:10%
back and forth.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.382 align:middle line:84%
And maybe even to
other moons and other--

00:26:58.382 --> 00:27:00.090 align:middle line:84%
even if they don't
land, maybe just orbit

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
a moon of Jupiter or something
and then come back, you know.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a big
prospect for private space.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, will
other countries like China

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.870 align:middle line:84%
get to Mars and reveal things
way before even we will?

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think that
they want to reveal things.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But the problem that you
have is the United States

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:84%
has so much control
over space right

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:90%
now, just around our planet.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.899 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Every war that's
won, like the war in Iraq

00:27:25.899 --> 00:27:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and everything, they're
all won from space.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Without space you
can't win those wars.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.584 align:middle line:84%
Because those are
all space wars.

00:27:30.584 --> 00:27:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean is
the communications

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:90%
all operate from satellites.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And we've dominated
the satellite system

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.160 align:middle line:84%
around Earth, the
web around Earth.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's like 2,700
satellites up there now.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.280 align:middle line:90%
From all nations.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: From all nations.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But we dominate the
majority of them

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and have control over
the majority of them.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And also then, the
risk of facing embargo.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So you're a country that
wants to expose something.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know that if you
expose this information,

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.434 align:middle line:84%
your country may
face an embargo.

00:27:56.434 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:84%
You may be banned from
selling to this country

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:84%
or shipping goods
to that country.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:90%
You may be a target from space.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.870 align:middle line:90%
And so what do you do?

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
You just fall in line
with what's going on

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.904 align:middle line:84%
and just take in the profits
and keep everything quiet.

00:28:09.904 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does your
group feel about where

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:90%
we're headed with exploration?

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We're headed in a
good direction with exploration.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they're going out there

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and doing some pretty good
missions that are sending back

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of great data, even
the mission that we just

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:90%
went to Pluto.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.200 align:middle line:84%
The mission to Mercury
was phenomenal.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:84%
We got a lot of phenomenal
data from these missions.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, people
think Mercury, again,

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:31.940 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't live there.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:84%
But Mercury has more
oxygen on it than Earth.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is 42% oxygen. Earth
is 20.9% oxygen. You know,

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:90%
so people realize these things.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:41.970 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of--

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just a little
too close to the sun.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.106 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's a
little too close.

00:28:45.106 --> 00:28:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But it only rotates on its
axis once every 59 days.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.094 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So the
majority of the planet

00:28:51.094 --> 00:28:53.719 align:middle line:84%
isn't in the sun on
a consistent basis.

00:28:53.719 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And it actually has
a cooling effect.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So now they've discovered
billions of tons of water

00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:90%
on Mercury.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That has
not evaporated?

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Not evaporated.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You make space
search fun, by the way.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you, thank you.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.788 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know that?

00:29:05.788 --> 00:29:06.750 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.957 align:middle line:84%
Are you the spokesperson
for the group as well?

00:29:08.957 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, I am.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:90%
And tell me about your sites.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Because you get millions of
hits on your sites all the time.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.158 align:middle line:10%
I'm the original founder
of forbidden knowledge

00:29:18.158 --> 00:29:20.550 align:middle line:10%
with the number four,
So 4biddenknowledge.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.395 align:middle line:90%
And it's 4biddenknowledge.com.

00:29:22.395 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Then I started putting out this
information about all our years

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and years of research
that I've been involved

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.890 align:middle line:84%
with from everything
from ancient mysteries

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:32.266 align:middle line:84%
to current technology to
suppressed information.

00:29:32.266 --> 00:29:33.390 align:middle line:10%
And it really has exploded.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.550 align:middle line:10%
So from forbidden
knowledge to the United

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.842 align:middle line:10%
Family of Anomaly Hunters.

00:29:36.842 --> 00:29:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think is going

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:84%
to be the big breakthrough,
Billy, in terms of information

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.550 align:middle line:90%
disclosure to us?

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've talked to so
many people who all agree,

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:84%
except one or two,
that we're not going

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.590 align:middle line:90%
to get government disclosure.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.321 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to get the answers?

00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The answers are being
given out by groups like us.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.050 align:middle line:90%
We are your disclosure.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're allowing
it to happen.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.440 align:middle line:84%
They know that we are
discovering these anomalies.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't
stop you, can they?

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They can't stop--

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.905 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
want to stop us.

00:30:03.905 --> 00:30:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I think we're part of
an experiment with them.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they're in a weird way,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.370 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of using us
to bring forth information

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:11.660 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bigger story if
they do try to stop you.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Because that makes
reference that maybe you're

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:90%
on to something.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely, for sure.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Rather just-- if
I were running a government

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to discredit
you, I would not

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:90%
do anything negative to you.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I would just let
you do your thing.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I would just let
people say, anomalies on Mars?

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, come on.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:90%
And just leave it like that.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But the day I try to
shut you down gives you

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.490 align:middle line:90%
the credibility that you need.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.656 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Absolutely, and
there's no doubt about it.

00:30:41.656 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Right now we're just
out here talking.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.008 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
are really starting

00:30:45.008 --> 00:30:47.204 align:middle line:84%
to research the anomalies
that we have put out

00:30:47.204 --> 00:30:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the information
that I've put out

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.161 align:middle line:90%
through 4biddenknowledge.

00:30:50.161 --> 00:30:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're starting
to go, wait a minute.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.139 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting here.

00:30:53.139 --> 00:30:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these things
are really here.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.850 align:middle line:90%
I see them myself.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not like it's just on TV.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like I've
gone, we give people

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
direction on how to look
them up for their selves.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And we like people to
get involved with us.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.625 align:middle line:90%
We actually invite them in.

00:31:04.625 --> 00:31:05.541 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:31:05.541 --> 00:31:07.754 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Versus just here's
what we got, look at it.

00:31:07.754 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:84%
No we actually
want you guys to be

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.000 align:middle line:90%
a part of this whole process.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do
any investigating

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:16.850 align:middle line:84%
or looking at images sent
from the International Space

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Station?

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, all
the time a lot.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:90%
A lot of video.

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
strange, strange place.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They're
great for video.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.200 align:middle line:90%
And their videos are--

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But don't
they shut these down

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:90%
after something happens?

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, they shut
them down pretty quick,

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:90%
but so many have gotten through.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:10%
So many that they didn't
even realize happened

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.350 align:middle line:10%
have gotten through until
afterwards and it was too late.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:37.130 align:middle line:10%
A lot of interesting
anomalies in space right

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:10%
around our planet of objects.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:10%
Some 20 meters, some
20 miles in diameter.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh, huge.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Huge.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're not
satellites, are they?

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: No, they're
not satellites.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.879 align:middle line:10%
You can see them
congregating around

00:31:47.879 --> 00:31:49.940 align:middle line:10%
the tops of lightning storms.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:10%
You can see them leaving
and coming and going

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.630 align:middle line:10%
from the planet's surface.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these objects
are hiding in the infrared

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:90%
and the multi-spectrum.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:10%
Because when that multi-spectrum
camera goes on on the ISS,

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.847 align:middle line:10%
all of a sudden, you
see all of these things

00:32:01.847 --> 00:32:03.180 align:middle line:10%
flying around and moving around.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some believe
that there is a cover up

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.720 align:middle line:84%
from the International
Space Station.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you didn't see it,
I'm going to play it again.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to zoom in right
up here near the solar panels

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:17.460 align:middle line:90%
where this thing first appears.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:84%
It's flying overhead
and in the distance.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.440 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.240 align:middle line:90%
And there it is.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.073 align:middle line:90%
Did you guys see it?

00:32:24.073 --> 00:32:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Now watch, it's
going to come back

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.750 align:middle line:84%
out going the
opposite direction.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:28.550 align:middle line:90%
There it goes.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:29.570 align:middle line:90%
You see it?

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And there's the hand.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Immediately after
this thing flies past,

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.840 align:middle line:84%
this hand goes right
in front of the camera.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you still
haven't seen it, let's

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and slow this down.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:42.640 align:middle line:90%
There's the object.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.590 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.850 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Look as it curves and flies
out into space disappearing.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's the hand that
comes in front trying

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.320 align:middle line:90%
to hide the camera's view.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Granted, something went
by there and we saw it.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:06.620 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's another
object that's apparently,

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.840 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason, they're
flying all around the planet.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could it be ours?

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:15.134 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It could be ours.

00:33:15.134 --> 00:33:18.060 align:middle line:90%
It could be somebody else's.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.050 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our governments
are so advanced now.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.180 align:middle line:84%
They used to be 50
years ahead of us.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe now they're
about 300 years ahead of us

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:90%
of what we know exists.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.930 align:middle line:84%
The famous Ben Rich
made a statement

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.830 align:middle line:90%
that we can take ET home.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.046 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I really think
that we have that technology.

00:33:36.046 --> 00:33:38.790 align:middle line:10%
But I also really do believe
after listening to the NASA

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:10%
black box from Apollo
11, and I actually

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.290 align:middle line:10%
downloaded all the transcripts
directly from NASA.gov

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:45.510 align:middle line:10%
from the Apollo 11 black box.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:10%
The astronauts say look at
that convex crater down there.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I bet the people in
there never get out.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And I really
believe that there's

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.970 align:middle line:90%
people living on the moon.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I really, honestly believe that.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.212 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From Earth?

00:34:00.212 --> 00:34:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They
could be from Earth.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Or they could be
from somewhere else.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But to make a statement like
that, I don't think you just

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.139 align:middle line:84%
openly would say something
like that on the Apollo 11

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:12.570 align:middle line:84%
official mission just
to be making a joke.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Nobody laughed.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.786 align:middle line:84%
And then the guy
tried to make him

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:16.139 align:middle line:90%
change the subject real quick.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is amazing
evidence and proof.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the black box tapes
are all marked out, top secret.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.060 align:middle line:84%
But that particular one
statement they left it there.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.889 align:middle line:84%
And they left the voice
file there as well.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:26.730 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty interesting.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.429 align:middle line:84%
Billy, you talked about
earlier a secret space program.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Corey Goode has
talked about on Gaia

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.820 align:middle line:90%
a secret space program as well.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:39.630 align:middle line:84%
What is the purpose of
a secret space program?

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.627 align:middle line:90%
To me it sounds military.

00:34:41.627 --> 00:34:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It really
is, in my opinion,

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:44.699 align:middle line:90%
more military than civilian.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, it's top secret.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.795 align:middle line:90%
It's very secure.

00:34:47.795 --> 00:34:49.920 align:middle line:84%
When I saw Corey Goode
speak, it was the first time

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:84%
I got to see him
speak by himself,

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:53.074 align:middle line:90%
just him talking to a crowd.

00:34:53.074 --> 00:34:54.449 align:middle line:84%
And he went back
to his childhood

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:55.720 align:middle line:90%
and was talking real briefly.

00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And
emotionally, I felt it.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:00.105 align:middle line:90%
And I saw him get choked up.

00:35:00.105 --> 00:35:01.480 align:middle line:84%
He really went
through something.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.130 align:middle line:90%
This guy is--

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
happened to him.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.088 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Something happened.

00:35:04.088 --> 00:35:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Something really happened.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Because when he got choked
up, it almost made me get

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.640 align:middle line:90%
choked up.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I really felt that he
was being extremely candid.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was reliving this.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And to get choked up,
something bad happen.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.120 align:middle line:84%
The program that
he's talking about,

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.940 align:middle line:84%
the programs, actually plural,
really do, in my mind exist.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Quite a few people
have come forward

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:84%
now talking about
similar programs,

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.424 align:middle line:84%
including the former Foreign
Minister of Defense for Canada.

00:35:28.424 --> 00:35:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Paul Hellyer.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Paul Hellyer, correct.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.028 align:middle line:84%
And I really think when you
have this many credible sources

00:35:33.028 --> 00:35:34.530 align:middle line:84%
coming forward,
making the claims

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.600 align:middle line:84%
that this program
exists, and I believe

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.070 align:middle line:84%
that this program exists for
further exploration of space,

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.650 align:middle line:84%
communication with
ETs that have us

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:48.600 align:middle line:84%
on ourselves on a very
slow process of involvement

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:53.190 align:middle line:84%
into the bigger family, so to
speak, the galactic community.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're on a trial
basis, and we're

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.560 align:middle line:84%
working our way into
getting a seat at the table.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you want to stay
ahead of other countries,

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I think a normal space
program that is secret

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.750 align:middle line:90%
is probably very important.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.340 align:middle line:90%
You can go--

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
fault them for that.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: No, you can't.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Listen, you go all they way
back into ancient times,

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:15.060 align:middle line:84%
there were people were
flying devices three

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.726 align:middle line:90%
and four thousand years ago.

00:36:16.726 --> 00:36:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Now not like high tech
helicopters and things

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.460 align:middle line:84%
like that, but they had
these flying devices

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.543 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Vimanas, huh?

00:36:21.543 --> 00:36:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Vimanas, they
had different types of--

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:84%
a version of kind
of a helicopter.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But it was a weird device that
used a combination of balloons

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.910 align:middle line:90%
and a rotator on top.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Now these kings and
leaders of these countries

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that owned these devices,
when you research it,

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.230 align:middle line:84%
they would keep them
extremely quiet.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Because if their enemy
discovered them and were

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:84%
able to reproduce
them or steal them--

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, or steal them.

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Then they
can come back and use

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.534 align:middle line:90%
them to fight against them.

00:36:47.534 --> 00:36:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Get over their walls and drop
things on them, bombs on them

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.930 align:middle line:90%
or whatever and blow them up.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So and drop fireballs or
whatever the case may be.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So these things were kept
extremely, extremely top

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.040 align:middle line:90%
secret, even back then.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think every society,
going all the way back as far

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:02.400 align:middle line:84%
as you can go,
always had weapons

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that were kept extremely
secret, or technology

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.720 align:middle line:84%
was kept extremely
secret so that nobody

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:84%
would be able to use it
against them, you know,

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.360 align:middle line:90%
against themselves.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
your next breakthrough will be?

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.095 align:middle line:84%
As you investigate images,
anomalies, what do you think

00:37:16.095 --> 00:37:17.229 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen?

00:37:17.229 --> 00:37:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think the
next big breakthrough

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:24.210 align:middle line:84%
is going to be actually getting
confirmation of life on one

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.787 align:middle line:90%
of these moons or planets.

00:37:25.787 --> 00:37:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be exciting.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.926 align:middle line:84%
I think that's going to be the
next big, big breakthrough,

00:37:29.926 --> 00:37:32.619 align:middle line:84%
we have captured what
we think might be life.

00:37:32.619 --> 00:37:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking about
something that really

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:90%
appears to be alive, alive.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe whether it's
a voice transmission

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.770 align:middle line:90%
that we capture and decipher.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe whether
it's an image that

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:46.322 align:middle line:84%
came through that shows
maybe aquatic life

00:37:46.322 --> 00:37:47.280 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:84%
But I really believe
that that's going

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.166 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the
biggest catalysts

00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to take us over the top is
discovering something alive.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, to me
it's kind of sad when you

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:56.790 align:middle line:90%
look at the anomalies on Mars.

00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And as you were talking about
structures that are now gone,

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.320 align:middle line:90%
are empty.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.670 align:middle line:90%
People are gone.

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of sad to
look at the desolation,

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and then think back
of the tragedy that

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:12.330 align:middle line:84%
might have occurred that day
over a period of time that

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:13.916 align:middle line:84%
completely obliterated
the planet.

00:38:13.916 --> 00:38:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:16.206 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
biggest reasons why

00:38:16.206 --> 00:38:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I am into this anomaly
hunting, to be honest with you,

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.240 align:middle line:84%
is because I truly believe that
those who do not know the past

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.820 align:middle line:84%
are destined to
fail in the future.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I think
people go, "why do you

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.290 align:middle line:90%
care about this so much?"

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.789 align:middle line:84%
Well, because I want to know
what really happened back then.

00:38:28.789 --> 00:38:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want
it to happen again.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to be part
of the process that

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.170 align:middle line:84%
alters our space
time continuum, that

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:90%
alters the path of mankind.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.721 align:middle line:84%
So we can even go back
into the golden age

00:38:38.721 --> 00:38:39.970 align:middle line:90%
and experience it much better.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.662 align:middle line:84%
I won't be here to see it, but
many others generations down

00:38:42.662 --> 00:38:43.620 align:middle line:90%
will be able to see it.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to have
mankind experience that

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.290 align:middle line:84%
bliss once again and get to a
higher level of civilization,

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:51.571 align:middle line:90%
peace, and just tranquility.

00:38:51.571 --> 00:38:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Safe to
say you're obsessed

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.450 align:middle line:90%
with getting these answers?

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I'm obsessed
with it nonstop.

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a day in, day out.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.975 align:middle line:84%
I'm so blessed to be able now
to do it pretty much full time.

00:39:01.975 --> 00:39:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been able to really
dedicate a lot of my life

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:06.970 align:middle line:84%
to just these topics
and bringing information

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:07.770 align:middle line:90%
to the people.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:08.882 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't give up.

00:39:08.882 --> 00:39:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I won't, man.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.700 align:middle line:84%
That's one of my newest
songs, "Never Give Up."

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.616 align:middle line:84%
I just wrote a song with
some guys named that.

00:39:13.616 --> 00:39:15.480 align:middle line:84%
That's my main
goal, never give up.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
answer you're looking for?

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The answer is how
do we learn from the past?

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:26.450 align:middle line:84%
We know, even though it's not
official, that there were wars.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:27.250 align:middle line:90%
There were wars.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.291 align:middle line:84%
There's evidence of wars
on Earth and on the moon

00:39:29.291 --> 00:39:31.230 align:middle line:90%
and on Mars.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:33.300 align:middle line:84%
The main goal is how
can we prevent this

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.437 align:middle line:90%
from happening again?

00:39:34.437 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:84%
How can we wake up the
people on this planet

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.689 align:middle line:84%
to realize we've got to
take control of this planet?

00:39:38.689 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We better
wake up soon, too.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We got
to wake up soon.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.740 align:middle line:84%
We can't let a hundred people
control seven billion people

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.920 align:middle line:84%
The power has to go
back to the people

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.420 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
prevent these things.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.730 align:middle line:84%
If we allow
everybody to still be

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:53.490 align:middle line:84%
subservient to these very few
people that are controlling all

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:55.560 align:middle line:84%
these wars and
profits, we're going

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.920 align:middle line:84%
to end up in a very, very
bad situation very quick.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I sure remember back
in the '60s the slogan "Power

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.320 align:middle line:90%
to the People."

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And at
that time, Billy,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't quite understand, what
are these people talking about?

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:90%
But it makes sense now.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.486 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:40:13.486 --> 00:40:14.860 align:middle line:84%
The numbers, we
have the numbers.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:90%
There's seven billion of us.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And all we've got to do is stand
up and it's over, game over.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is that one
piece of evidence on Mars

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:26.470 align:middle line:84%
that you could show
to people and say,

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:84%
look at what I've been
trying to tell you?

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:33.190 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: The man and the woman
collapsed, crouched together,

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.790 align:middle line:10%
apparently passed away in that
spot from whatever tragedy

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:10%
occurred at that moment
to take them down

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.680 align:middle line:10%
is one of the most heartbreaking
pieces of evidence I have ever

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.480 align:middle line:10%
seen.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
about our size?

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: They're smaller.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:46.784 align:middle line:90%
They're much smaller.

00:40:46.784 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:84%
They come up probably
to our waist.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do they
look humanoid or do

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:53.792 align:middle line:90%
they look like the alien grays?

00:40:53.792 --> 00:40:55.000 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: They look humanoid.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.120 align:middle line:10%
You know, if they were here,
you would think that they

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.494 align:middle line:10%
would just dwarf humans.

00:40:59.494 --> 00:41:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just little people.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe we'll get
that answer one day, Billy.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I hope so.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.110 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where do people
get information on what you do?

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.520 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: You can go to
4biddenknowledge.com.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: With a four.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.420 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: With the number four.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:10.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The number four.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.278 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: You can also go to
4biddenknowledge on Instagram.

00:41:13.278 --> 00:41:15.670 align:middle line:10%
That's one of my larger
accounts, with the number four.

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:19.180 align:middle line:10%
As well as the United Family of
a Anomaly Hunters on Facebook.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.129 align:middle line:10%
And you can go to
anomalyhunters.tv

00:41:22.129 --> 00:41:24.420 align:middle line:10%
to see all of the work from
all of our anomaly hunters.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.067 align:middle line:10%

00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Thank you so
much, I appreciate it.

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isn't it amazing?

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:33.100 align:middle line:10%
We have an individual
and a group

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.000 align:middle line:10%
of people who look at images
from planetary systems

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:10%
like Mars and they are
actually seeing artifacts

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.420 align:middle line:10%
from prior civilizations.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.190 align:middle line:90%
It is truly remarkable.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And you get to see
that on Beyond Belief.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for watching.
