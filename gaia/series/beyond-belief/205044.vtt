>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:84%
We've got a great guest
for you, Brooks Agnew

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:84%
back with us, an
Air Force veteran.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:84%
He received his Bachelor
of Science degree

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:84%
with honors in chemistry from
Tennessee Technical University.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:10%
He is a seven time best selling
author with 11 titles in print.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:10%
He's been the host
of "X-Squared Radio"

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:10%
for 15 years and is currently
the CEO of an electric truck

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:10%
company in North Carolina.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Brooks, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BROOKS AGNEW: Thank
you so much, George.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Wow.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the pace at
which everything is going

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:10%
is just amazing.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:10%
The world is changing
so fast and having

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:10%
to adapt to all those changes
really keeps you on your feet.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.128 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It doesn't stop.

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: It doesn't stop.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:10%
You know, things we
thought we could rely on

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.022 align:middle line:10%
in a decade or even
five years or two years,

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:10%
all those are out the window.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:10%
Everything changes
because of global forces

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.273 align:middle line:10%
that are having local effects.

00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Over the
years, you and I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
have talked about
a possible trip

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the Earth.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Remember that one?

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.213 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was a great story.

00:01:24.213 --> 00:01:26.780 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about space
issues and everything else.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:90%
You're multifaceted.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Where did you get all
this historical data from?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, I do
a lot of research.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: First of all,
for writing the books,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
you have to do a lot of
research to get the background

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:90%
information to fill that in.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, you
just pick up pieces--

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:90%
treasures-- along the way.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when it comes
time to recall them,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm fortunately able to
recall them when I need to.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Then I can tell a good story
and put those things together,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:84%
connect the dots, so
to speak, so people

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:90%
can understand what's going on.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 51 years ago, we went
to the moon with Apollo 11.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.765 align:middle line:90%
Why did we stop?

00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I think there
were a lot of reasons.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
In '72, we actually had two
full launch crews ready to go.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:90%
We had the launch engines.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:84%
We had the crews and the
backup crews all trained.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:90%
They were all paid for.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we just
stopped going to the moon.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, I think
the main force that

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:90%
made that happen was political.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:10%
As you know, every two
years, Congress changes.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Congress holds
onto the purse strings.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that spend
the money, allocate the money,

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
decide where the country's
going to go monetarily.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And they just decided that
the public was tired of space.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.483 align:middle line:90%
So they just ended the program.

00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was like
the competitiveness

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:84%
with the Soviets at
the time pushed us.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I always remember
that JFK speech.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:90%
We choose to go to the moon.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Once we did it-- you're right--

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I think people
got bored with it.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
We don't go there
because it's easy.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:90%
We go there because it's hard.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.257 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:02:57.257 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And you're
exactly right.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:84%
But, again, we're talking
about these global forces.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:84%
We were competing with the
Russians-- or the Soviets then.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was an economic
game, but it was also--

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:84%
something I mentioned
before is the high ground.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:84%
We know that whoever
controls the high ground is

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.530 align:middle line:90%
going to control this world.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And for all intents
and purposes,

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
the moon is the high
ground right now.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Well, because it's--

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:84%
sits above the Earth and
you're able to defend it.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
But you're able to
pick off satellites

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
that are in low Earth orbit
from the moon quite easily.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And you're
so far away that you

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle line:84%
can't be hit with a missile or
a laser or anything like that.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So you really are in a great
offensive and defensive

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:90%
position.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.248 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about helium-3?

00:03:42.248 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:90%
I keep hearing so much about it.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And why is it so sought after?

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Helium is
the result of fusion.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.050 align:middle line:84%
When you put two hydrogen
protons together,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:90%
you make helium.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
On this planet,
we have helium-4.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It's what we fill our
party balloons with.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:90%
We do have some hel--

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.492 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It makes us talk like
this if you suck it in, right?

00:04:01.492 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Exactly.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
But helium-3 only
exists around volcanoes.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.460 align:middle line:84%
It comes up from inside
the Earth and with magma,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:90%
and so it's rare on this planet.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
On the moon, it's been exposed
to solar radiation for billions

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And so helium-3 has
accumulated in large amounts,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and in low craters,
it is actually frozen,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:90%
sitting there--

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Frozen?

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Frozen, like--

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --mountains
the size of Everest,

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
upside down, in craters on
the south pole of the moon,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.650 align:middle line:90%
just sitting there.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of helium-3 is
it is isotopic, in a sense.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:90%
It has one less proton.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So when you take helium-3
and you mash them together,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:84%
you end up with
helium-4 plus 2 protons.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But you also release
a lot of energy.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So the beauty to that
is, instead of fission,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:84%
like we use now in our nuclear
power plants where we put off

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
neutrons, neutrons
cannot be controlled.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.320 align:middle line:90%
They have no charge on them.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
We can't move them around
with electrical charge.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:90%
But protons, we can.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So a helium-3 reaction
isn't radioactive.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So you could make energy,
lots of it, without radiation.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The program
"Science Verse" tells us

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:84%
where most of the supply
of helium-3 is held.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look, Brooks.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.746 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:18.746 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:10%
- When it comes to supply,
helium-3 can be found on Earth,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.360 align:middle line:10%
however, not in amounts we
would consider adequate.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:10%
You see, our tremendous
amount of helium-3

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:10%
is not found down in the ground
but rather up in the sky.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:10%
Yup, our moon is a
cornucopia of helium-3.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:10%
But how is this?

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:10%
The simple answer is solar
winds containing helium-3.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:10%
For those of you who don't
know what solar winds are,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:10%
I covered them in my Mars video.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.460 align:middle line:10%
Anyways, solar winds containing
concentrations of helium-3

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.190 align:middle line:10%
have bathed the moon
in the substance.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.010 align:middle line:10%
However, the helium-3 wasn't
scattered across the moon

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:10%
evenly with some regions
containing more than others,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:10%
especially with lunar
maria containing

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:10%
more than half the
helium-3 on the moon.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.560 align:middle line:10%
Moreover, meteorite
collisions have

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:10%
resulted in the helium-3 being
buried a couple of meters

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:10%
deep in the lunar soil, leaving
us with the question of,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:10%
how do we extract it?

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Exactly what
you've been saying.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, great
minds think alike.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:84%
But as it turns out, it's not
scattered all over the moon.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly concentrated in what
we call Schrodinger's basin,

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.017 align:middle line:90%
which is on the south pole.

00:06:31.017 --> 00:06:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just there.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It is not
really ever in the dark,

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's not ever
really in the light.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.270 align:middle line:84%
But it does receive the solar
wind going around the moon.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It's so cold there that helium-3
can exist in solid form.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's easy to mine.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:84%
In the Schrodinger's basin
are many large craters.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:84%
One of them is called
the Shackleford crater.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, if we could
land on that crater,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.492 align:middle line:10%
we could actually drill and
core and mine helium-3 solid.

00:07:01.492 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do
you get it back here?

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Do you have to fly it back?

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: We do.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.060 align:middle line:90%
We have a system of canisters.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:84%
We put them in canisters,
and the canisters

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:90%
launch into orbit.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:84%
They're collected in a carrier
craft, which takes them up

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:90%
into orbit.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And then it can
then be picked up

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.260 align:middle line:84%
or fly itself back to
low Earth orbit, where

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:90%
it can be extracted.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big are
these canisters, Brooks?

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.135 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The canisters
hold about 3 kilotons.

00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty big.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: They're a
pretty good size.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.310 align:middle line:84%
The next generation
of this, of course,

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.940 align:middle line:84%
is to not bring all the
helium-3 back to Earth.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:90%
It would certainly be valuable.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
But its real value comes as a
fuel for interplanetary travel.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.313 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From there--
like a base, right?

00:07:46.313 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right, right.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
We could actually
refuel our crafts

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:84%
in space, which would be
greatly valuable because it's

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
so expensive to lift fuel
from the Earth into orbit.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.588 align:middle line:90%
It's like $20,000 per kilogram.

00:08:00.588 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:90%
It's amazingly expensive.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.577 align:middle line:84%
So it would be worth it
financially to extract this?

00:08:06.577 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It's a gold rush.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.068 align:middle line:84%
If we could put and
build craft in space,

00:08:11.068 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
lift all the pieces, like it
would be the International

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Space Station.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:84%
We have a system we
call the gateway.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
The gateway is a
system of craft made

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
by different private
companies, like Bigelow

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
inflatable in habitats, and
launch engines, and fusion

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:90%
rocketry.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.372 align:middle line:10%
And all these things
are put together

00:08:28.372 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:10%
like a Tinkertoy in space.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:84%
You're talking something
half a million tons in size.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
We could never lift
it off the Earth.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But then you refuel
it in space, and then

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.002 align:middle line:84%
it can take off for Mars or
wherever you want to take it.

00:08:42.002 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did the
Soviets, now the Russians,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:84%
just basically
forget about space?

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, they're-- the
Soviets had tremendous economic

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.290 align:middle line:84%
power, and they could draw from
the technology from areas like

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Kazakhstan and Livonia and--

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
but now the states
have all broken up,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:90%
and they're all private.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: So Russia
is rather small.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not really a big
economic power in the world.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:84%
It has become autonomous
in a lot of ways,

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.410 align:middle line:84%
but it has a lot
of good technology.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So it has to integrate
itself into other programs.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
The Russians and the
Americans work very, very well

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:90%
together in space.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't appear to work very
well together in politics,

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and I still can't
understand that.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:90%
But that's where we're at.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
the Chinese, Brooks?

00:09:23.055 --> 00:09:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Where are they headed?

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The Chinese
is a different story.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
With China-- and I've done
business with China, now,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:90%
for over 20 years.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing business
with China right now.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.340 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't like doing
business with Chinese companies.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like doing business
with the Chinese government.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And the Chinese government has
a different idea about space

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:90%
than the Chinese people.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Chinese scientists that I
work with, they're brilliant.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:90%
They're smart.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I graduated with a bunch
of them from college.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:90%
They're diligent.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:90%
They work hard.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.937 align:middle line:84%
But they do not have the
same goal as their party.

00:09:54.937 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
The party has a different goal,
and that's that higher ground.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:90%
They want control.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they want
this party control.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be headed that way,
in that direction, together.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We're not
coordinating with the Chinese

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:90%
on this effort.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So all of the probes
that we've seen

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:84%
go to the moon and the Chinese
Space Station and other things

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
have been purely
Chinese efforts.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The upsetting thing
about it is about 90%

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:27.233 align:middle line:84%
of the technology that is
in those craft is ours.

00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:90%
What'd they do, steal it?

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.418 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes.

00:10:30.418 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything they do,
they've stolen, basically.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Or it was sold to them
for money, for political power.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, exactly.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:84%
I understand the Clinton
administration sold a lot,

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:90%
didn't it?

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.888 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, it's like I'm
going to leave this laptop here

00:10:43.888 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:84%
on this counter, and if it's
not here when I come back,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it went.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Uh huh, I'll be right
back, that kind of thing?

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.762 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, and
by the way, here's

00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:51.850 align:middle line:10%
my nonprofit where you
can deposit the money.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.897 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it was done?

00:10:52.897 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Absolutely.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh god, frustrating.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I know they're going to
Mars now, too, right?

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yes, the Mars
is really the big goal.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
it has some atmosphere.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It has way more
gravity than the moon.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have the fuel
reserves that the moon does.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.335 align:middle line:84%
But it has access to an
even bigger treasure.

00:11:12.335 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that is?

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: The asteroid belt.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The asteroid
belt is right outside--

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That asteroid
belt consists of what?

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Wow.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
You name it-- solid, platinum,
asteroids, gold, copper--

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Oh, yes-- iron.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:84%
But the real gold
in space is water.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And there are entire mountains
of water floating frozen

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.380 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.088 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do we
want water there for?

00:11:40.088 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:90%
We've got enough here.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, but we can lift
water from the Earth to Mars.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But that would be
incredibly expensive.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: If you could
grab a water asteroid

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and pull it to Mars,
which would be easy to do,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:84%
then you've got all
that water right there

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.570 align:middle line:90%
at a fraction of the cost.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And water could be used not
only to drink, but also to make

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:84%
oxygen and also to
make rocket fuel.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
You've got this down
to a science, Brooks.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It is a science.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think one
person has a grasp on it.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I've been speaking in my
research for my latest

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:84%
book, "Asteroid Mining," with
a lot of private companies.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And they've all specialized
in tiny, little places--

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
surface robots that do
nothing but dig and process

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:84%
minerals, the launch systems
that fill up the canisters

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and launch the
canisters up into orbit

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.780 align:middle line:90%
where they could be picked up.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:84%
There's whole
companies that do that.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:10%
And of course,
what has happened,

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:10%
as in all entrepreneurial
ramp-ups like this,

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:10%
you have a lot of acquisitions.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of
companies getting so far

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and going bankrupt, which
just happened with--

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I think it's OneWeb.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:84%
They launched several
hundred satellites

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.240 align:middle line:90%
for their internet system.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.680 align:middle line:90%
And then SoftBank--

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they go belly up.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.882 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, SoftBank didn't
make the next capital call,

00:12:57.882 --> 00:12:58.840 align:middle line:90%
and they went belly up.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:84%
But all those satellites
are still up there.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.348 align:middle line:84%
So they're acquired by
another company and--

00:13:03.348 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever
get back to the moon?

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Will we ever colonize the moon?

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes, I think so.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:90%
Right now, we're working on--

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:84%
around our planet,
we have a GPS system.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.420 align:middle line:90%
It's aging.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to replace
that with smaller--

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.367 align:middle line:84%
what we call CubeSats, which
are more efficient, more cheaper

00:13:19.367 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:90%
satellites to build.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They work the same way?

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: They work the same
way, but much higher frequency.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.938 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with much
higher frequencies now.

00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:27.473 align:middle line:90%
We're into 5G and 6G.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And these systems
will be very efficient.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
We extrapolate that GPS system
and kind of envelope the moon.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't give
us much resolution.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:90%
We can't use them for landing.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:84%
The Indians just tried that,
and they splatted their rover

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:84%
on the planet at
several hundred knots.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't
have the resolution.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So we need to put a GPS
system around the moon.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's being
designed right now.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.952 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the advantage
of us living on the moon?

00:13:57.952 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, the
advantage is you

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
have a lot more
access to minerals

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.820 align:middle line:84%
that you don't
have on the Earth.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And you don't upset the
ecology of the Earth.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
It takes-- it really hurts
the land to strip mine it

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
or to dig into it or to
blow it up or bulldoze it.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're very conscious of
the ecobalance of our planet.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:84%
So we can use other worlds
that don't have that concern.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.810 align:middle line:84%
We can mine helium-3 on the
moon for hundreds of years.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's enough helium-3 on
the moon to power everything

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
we have on the Earth
for another 1,000 years.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The moon's only 239,000
miles away from good old planet

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It's much closer than Mars or
any other celestial object.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that an advantage for us?

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Sure.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:90%
It's just two days away.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:90%
There are a couple challenges.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:84%
One is what we call
the cislunar space.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the space between
Earth and the moon.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:84%
In between, there
is a magnetosphere,

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.320 align:middle line:84%
but there's also a Van
Allen radiation belt.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Easy to send
probes and robots

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and payloads and things are,
hard to send people through.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the skeptics who
say we never went to the moon

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
cite that Van Allen belt as
one of the reasons we never

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:90%
got there.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, that's why--
they're looking at it now.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But when we were running
the space program from '69

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.310 align:middle line:84%
to '72 really aggressively
with humans, as it turned out,

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
the Van Allen radiation
belt was very relaxed.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And we were going
through it so fast

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that the astronauts were only
exposed for about two minutes.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to use
the thin lead shielding

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that they had to
protect the astronauts,

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we
went through it.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:84%
People say, well, we
didn't have the computers.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:84%
How did they land the
craft on the moon?

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:90%
And that answer is very easy--

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:90%
because we flew it.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:90%
We piloted--

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Manually.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: --to the ground.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:45.925 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:45.925 --> 00:15:46.725 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:46.725 --> 00:15:49.137 align:middle line:84%
I know, Armstrong, that's
how he landed on the moon.

00:15:49.137 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And they practiced
and practiced and practiced.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, I look at
baseball players.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:84%
You take a person that
can see a ball that's

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:90%
76 millimeters in diameter--

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At 90 miles
an hour, is it not?

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Oh, it's hit
at 110 miles an hour.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And an outfielder
will see that hit,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and he will operate millions of
muscles and eyes and everything

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and make adjustments,
and he will

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:84%
intercept that ball
in flight, jumping

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:90%
and catch it in a glove.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Only one out of 10,000
humans can even do that.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:84%
It's even smaller number
that can land a lunar

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:90%
lander on the moon.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.867 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
best of the best.

00:16:27.867 --> 00:16:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I got a chance to talk with
astrophysicist Jeffrey Bennett,

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:90%
who talked about colonization.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:10%
Do you think civilizations,
Jeffrey, get to a point

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:42.910 align:middle line:10%
where they will eventually
die out, even the humans?

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, we're going to
reach a peak, a saturation

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:10%
point, and then tail off.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:10%
>>JEFFREY BENNETT: It's a
really interesting question.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:10%
My own belief is
that you either--

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:10%
and this is very
important because it's

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:10%
where we are today.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:10%
You reach a point, like we
are now, where we actually

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:10%
have so much power
in our technology

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:10%
that we can do a lot of
really horrible things.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yes, we can.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.752 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: And we could
easily wipe ourselves out

00:17:07.752 --> 00:17:10.579 align:middle line:10%
of existence over
this next century.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:10%
If we don't, if we find a
way to solve our problems,

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:10%
that's going to require
creating political structures,

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.329 align:middle line:10%
social structures that
prevent people from using

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:24.260 align:middle line:10%
this technology in bad ways.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:10%
And if we do that,
then the doors

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:10%
are wide open for us
to set out to colonize

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.900 align:middle line:10%
the planets and maybe
thousands of years from now

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:10%
to being in
colonizing the stars.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:10%
And once you do
that, it would seem

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:10%
like you're almost immune
to being wiped out,

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.640 align:middle line:10%
because as you spread yourselves
around to many worlds,

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:10%
even if one world suffered a
catastrophe, you will survive--

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:10%
your species will
survive on other worlds.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.250 align:middle line:10%
And you already have
these structures,

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:10%
political and
social, in place that

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:10%
are allowing you to survive.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.960 align:middle line:10%
So I think civilizations get to
this point where we are today,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:10%
and this is where
it all happens.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's the turning point.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.602 align:middle line:10%
>>BENNETT: This is
the turning point.

00:18:02.602 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:10%
It's over the next
50 to 100 years

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:10%
for us that we make
all the decisions that

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:10%
will decide whether we
end up wiping ourselves

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:10%
out and falling off
or whether we're

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:10%
on our way to becoming
a galactic civilization

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:10%
or joining a galactic
civilization that may already

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:19.900 align:middle line:10%
predate us.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The Federation.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BENNETT: Correct.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
physicist Stephen Hawking

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:84%
felt that we needed to leave
this planet for reasons

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, as I do my
anthropological research,

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.140 align:middle line:84%
as he did, I came up with a
little different take on it.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I see that each time in
history, when we have a frontier

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.300 align:middle line:84%
to explore, whether it's
America or whether it's

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.570 align:middle line:84%
another continent,
there's generally peace.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
the same people that

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:84%
are ruling the world today have
ruled the world for thousands

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in 1776, they lost
a little bit of that rule

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:90%
when America was formed.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Nobody saw it coming, really.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.343 align:middle line:84%
No prophet, seer, revelator
ever saw America coming.

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.677 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: So now
we're to the point

00:19:06.677 --> 00:19:10.450 align:middle line:84%
where we're almost ready
to hand America back over

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.335 align:middle line:90%
to that global power.

00:19:12.335 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:90%
And we could see it--

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It seems like we are.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Well--

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Doesn't it?

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We're at a point
of conflict right now.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:84%
At last, finally,
I think Americans

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.710 align:middle line:90%
see that global power.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really even
think it existed before.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Now we do.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.600 align:middle line:90%
We know who it is.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:90%
We know what it is.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:90%
But there's no frontier.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
There's no place for
Americans to run.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
All the land in
the whole world is

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:84%
developed unless you want
to move to Antarctica,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:90%
which I don't think we do.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:90%
The next frontier is space.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is space.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: If we can--

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.853 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always was.

00:19:42.853 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --open up the frontier,
I see 1,000 years of peace.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You still
see the globalism?

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, globalism
has always been tried.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think it maybe even
have supernatural roots to it.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:90%
But humans are not globalists.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Humans are localists.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
We're social
animals, and we like

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
to meet and work with one
another in communities.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:84%
There are entities that
like to control all that.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And by control, I don't mean
they want to feed us every day

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and educate us and take care
of us from cradle to grave.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:90%
That's not it at all.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.430 align:middle line:90%
They want to control our souls.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we always
flee to the wilderness.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
If you look through history,
when we fled to the wilderness,

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:90%
it was worth everything.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.710 align:middle line:84%
People sold everything,
including their own freedom,

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to get here so
they could be free.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are these people
who are so obsessed with

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.560 align:middle line:90%
controlling us--

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:90%
what's their motivation?

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, I don't
think it's people--

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Besides
the soul, of course.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I don't think it's
people that want the control.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.382 align:middle line:84%
People just want to be wealthy,
and they want to be powerful.

00:20:52.382 --> 00:20:53.182 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And have--

00:20:53.182 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: They want to
have a life of ease and--

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --and importance--
celebrity style, I guess.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a supernatural
level to this, almost--

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say Lucifer
or something like that.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get
crazy like that.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:90%
But there's--

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, go ahead.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, there is
some ancient intelligence

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:84%
behind this, because, as I
look at it going from 3,000 BC

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
until now, the
methods, the strategy,

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.313 align:middle line:90%
the tactics are always the same.

00:21:24.313 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:90%
And humans aren't like that.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:90%
We evolve.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:90%
We change.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.540 align:middle line:84%
We attack things from
different methods.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the same method over
and over and over again,

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:90%
just different people--

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:90%
different people.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about colonization.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:84%
How realistic do
you think it is?

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I think
it's very realistic.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And now, the difference in
technology for the moon, that's

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.890 align:middle line:90%
where we have two communities.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:84%
We have one community
that says, hey,

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:84%
let's build big,
beautiful, domed cities

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the moon--

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:90%
not very practical.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:84%
The sun has terrible
fits which would wipe out

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:90%
a surface civilization.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:84%
The key to colonizing the
moon are the volcanic vents,

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.830 align:middle line:84%
the underground network
of tunnels and vents

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:90%
that are on the moon.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For energy?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, you'd be
protected from solar radiation.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:84%
All we'd have to do is
seal up the openings,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.210 align:middle line:84%
slightly pressurize
that, and feed it energy,

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and you would have
an environment

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of the moon.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
dramatic, isn't it?

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It doesn't take
that much work, really.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:84%
We have-- we're practicing with
volcanic vents on the Earth.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:84%
We have 3D printers that can
easily be sent to the moon

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:90%
to seal up the openings.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.490 align:middle line:84%
It would take about
a dozen years or so

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:84%
to put an atmosphere
equivalent to, say, 8,000 feet

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:90%
altitude here on Earth inside.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: So you wouldn't
need a suit or anything

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:46.930 align:middle line:90%
to live in there.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.787 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: God, what a boring
life, though, wouldn't it be?

00:22:49.787 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Not really.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
want to go there?

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: There'd be a lot to do.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Plus, you'd only weigh one
sixth what you weigh here.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'll diet.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.962 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I'd want to
go to the moon and stay.

00:22:59.962 --> 00:23:00.795 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: I would go.

00:23:00.795 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:90%
I would go in a second.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And stay?

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:03.872 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, sure.

00:23:03.872 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like, for
the rest of your life?

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Well, yeah, I think so.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: Just because
it's a different place.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.072 align:middle line:10%
It's a different environment.

00:23:14.072 --> 00:23:15.030 align:middle line:90%
There are things to do.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And everything you do
changes the world forever.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have given us
some pictures of asteroids.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at some of them.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Sure.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.588 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And tell us what
we're looking at here

00:23:24.588 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:84%
and how this ties into
some of our things.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:90%
What's this, Brooks?

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, this is a
hybrid space station where

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:84%
they take an asteroid
and all the elements that

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
are on the asteroid,
and then they

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:84%
build equipment on the
asteroid, and they actually

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:84%
use the mass of the asteroid
as part of the space station.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's a mining operation,
but it's also an environment,

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.000 align:middle line:90%
a living environment.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.015 align:middle line:84%
And the larger the asteroid,
the more incredible

00:23:52.015 --> 00:23:53.140 align:middle line:90%
the environment can become.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
When you get to asteroids as
large as Eros or even Ceres,

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:84%
now you have even a modicum
of gravity on there.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why isn't that
spacecraft zooming off

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:90%
the asteroid?

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:07.817 align:middle line:90%
How can it stay?

00:24:07.817 --> 00:24:09.150 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: Well, they're attached.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:10%
They bore in and
fix their pylons.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:10%
And as long as they don't make
a move away from the asteroid,

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:10%
they're going to stay to it.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:84%
If you look on the surface of
there, there's a lot of loose--

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:84%
looks like gravel and
boulders and things.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.970 align:middle line:84%
They're held there
by microgravity.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big is this
asteroid, in your opinion?

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: This one's probably
about 1 kilometer across.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.340 align:middle line:10%
But there are asteroids
1,000 kilometers across.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are thousands
and thousands of them

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:90%
5 to 10 kilometers across.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what are we
looking at in the lower left?

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.210 align:middle line:90%
What is all that?

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Just equipment?

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, it's
just equipment, mostly

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:90%
mining equipment.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:84%
You see some gas accumulation
modules down here

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.010 align:middle line:90%
in the bottom of the picture--

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.093 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The yellow balls?

00:24:56.093 --> 00:24:58.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: --solar panels, vents.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of technology
would allow us to do this?

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Can we do this now?

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, we
can do this now.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.840 align:middle line:84%
We have all the equipment
to do this right now.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:90%
And what would you--

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
how would you get all
this back to our planet?

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.578 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, that's the
wonderful thing about it.

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:84%
You're out here in
the asteroid belt.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.790 align:middle line:84%
You're on the outside
of Mars' orbit.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So you would generally
be packaging--

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.750 align:middle line:90%
this is what's called a pusher.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is taking an
asteroid, and it's

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:90%
pushing it to another location.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This craft
is pushing it?

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's attached to
it, and it's pushing it.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can see, the habitats
are the large, round structures

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:90%
in the front.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:90%
That's where the crew stays.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And then this
actually physically

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:90%
attaches itself to an asteroid.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:44.092 align:middle line:84%
And like a tugboat, it just
pushes it through space.

00:25:44.092 --> 00:25:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, that looks
like a small asteroid.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.988 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah,
that's pretty small.

00:25:47.988 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:84%
That's just maybe a few
hundred yards across.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But if it was solid
platinum, it would be worth

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:90%
half a trillion dollars.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, are you pushing
this close to planet Earth?

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And what are the dangers
that it might hit?

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Probably we would not
move an asteroid back to Earth.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.820 align:middle line:84%
There are points
near Earth which

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:90%
we call the Lagrange points.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
They are points
of a gravity well,

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
an equidistant point between the
moon, the Earth, and the sun.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And it is where--

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
well, normally we
call them Trojans

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
where asteroids will kind
of float through space

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.225 align:middle line:84%
and they'll get sucked
into this gravity well

00:26:22.225 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:90%
and they'll stay there.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a lot of
those in the gravity wells

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:84%
around Earth-- these
Lagrange points.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So it would behoove Earth
to move an asteroid bigger

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:84%
than that, maybe 10 kilometers
across or 20 kilometers across,

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and set it in that
gravity well and then

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:90%
use it as a weigh station.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.780 align:middle line:84%
But it would be much
more than that, just more

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
than a refueling station
to refuel spacecraft

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.680 align:middle line:90%
for deeper travel.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It could also protect Earth from
things like near-Earth objects.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.560 align:middle line:84%
We do not see very much
of space from Earth.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.635 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That's why these
asteroids sneak up on us.

00:26:57.635 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's-- or
they zoom past us.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:90%
Then we see them.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
When you see it's dated 2020,
that means we just saw it.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not dated 2017.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.820 align:middle line:84%
We didn't see it
three years ago.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:84%
If you had a space
station out there,

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:84%
you could see these things years
before they approached Earth.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.795 align:middle line:84%
And you could actually
save the human race.

00:27:16.795 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You probably
could because it's just

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.130 align:middle line:84%
a matter of time
that-- it's not when,

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:90%
but if we're going to get hit.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Earth is a
very, very small target.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't get hit very often.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
If we do, we have
an atmosphere and--

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've been lucky.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.253 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: --usually it skips off.

00:27:31.253 --> 00:27:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, if you go back
to the Tunguska event,

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:84%
we're not really sure
how large that was.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.140 align:middle line:90%
But, fortunately--

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1908, right?

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Correct.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.310 align:middle line:90%
It didn't hit the surface.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.510 align:middle line:90%
It exploded.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:44.845 align:middle line:90%
It got so hot internally--

00:27:44.845 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had it hit the surface,
it would have been a disaster.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It would have been
an extinction-level event.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A couple years ago,
there was one over Russia again

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:55.210 align:middle line:90%
that blew up.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yes, that
was in Chelyabinsk.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And it did strike, but
it sort of skipped along

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.120 align:middle line:90%
the surface on the ice.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.990 align:middle line:84%
But the sonic booms from
it injured a lot of people.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What are the odds
that that region would get

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:10%
zapped twice over 100 years?

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: If Earth
is going to get hit,

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.910 align:middle line:84%
that's the region
that's going to get hit.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Again?

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.345 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It's not going to
be an equatorial strike.

00:28:18.345 --> 00:28:20.410 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a polar strike.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on that.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Near-Earth objects--
how long does it

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.890 align:middle line:84%
take to get to Mars from
here, a couple years?

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Right now, it
takes about seven months.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's all?

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: We have an opening--

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With the right
window, I guess, right?

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, we call
it the Hohmann maneuver.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.700 align:middle line:90%
We have two orbits.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it takes
twice as long for Mars

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.770 align:middle line:84%
to go around as
it does the Earth.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So we have a window that's
about a couple months long,

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.510 align:middle line:84%
every couple years,
where we can launch.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're moving
from one moving object

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.200 align:middle line:90%
to another moving object.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So because of the thrusters
that we have today,

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:middle line:90%
that window's pretty narrow.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.958 align:middle line:84%
And we have to hit the orbit
of Earth to the orbit of Mars.

00:29:04.958 --> 00:29:06.250 align:middle line:90%
It's called a Hohmann maneuver.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:90%
It's very tricky.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that easy to do?

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: No, it's very tricky.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And if we miss that
window, what happens?

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: You're lost
in space, I'm afraid.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Oh, yeah.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh jeez.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we have astronauts
and we miss the window,

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.500 align:middle line:90%
they're stuck out there.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Pretty much.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.698 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That's why we
need the fusion rockets.

00:29:23.698 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:84%
The fusion rockets would reduce
the travel time from Earth

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.250 align:middle line:90%
to Mars to 70 days.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking a
couple months in space.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.910 align:middle line:84%
That a human can do
without going insane.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: You put somebody in an
aluminum can for seven months--

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They'll go nuts.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.738 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --you have
a real problem.

00:29:40.738 --> 00:29:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Every day, every day.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:10%
Are they training astronauts
right now to do that?

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes, they are.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are they
noticing psychological things?

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: They always do.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
70% of Air Force
Academy graduates,

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:90%
right now, will be in space--

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:90%
70%.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have done a
lot of work in this area.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.342 align:middle line:84%
Are you involved
in these projects?

00:30:01.342 --> 00:30:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I've been an
enthusiast my whole life.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I grew
up in California,

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and I spent time
in the Air Force.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.400 align:middle line:90%
So I am a manufacturer.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.280 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.280 align:middle line:90%
I run manufacturing facilities.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm working with several
of the private companies that

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.780 align:middle line:84%
are building components
that go on these.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.472 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to help them
from a quality engineering

00:30:19.472 --> 00:30:21.180 align:middle line:84%
standpoint to help
them be more efficient

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.722 align:middle line:84%
and connect them
with other companies

00:30:22.722 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:90%
and help them survive.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we do
these things, Brooks,

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.367 align:middle line:84%
when would it happen,
in your opinion?

00:30:30.367 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: When you
say "these things--"

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:32.992 align:middle line:90%
it's happening right now.

00:30:32.992 --> 00:30:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Landing on
asteroids, mining asteroids,

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.532 align:middle line:84%
attempting to colonize
the moon or Mars.

00:30:38.532 --> 00:30:39.615 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: We recently did--

00:30:39.615 --> 00:30:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 50 years from now?

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We recently did
some flybys of asteroids,

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.830 align:middle line:90%
and we landed on an asteroid.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And that was just
a couple years ago.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.370 align:middle line:90%
But these are small probes.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:52.470 align:middle line:90%
They're driven by ion drives.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.680 align:middle line:84%
The ion drives light up
and stay lit all the time.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.720 align:middle line:84%
They have very little thrust,
but the thrust is very fast.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So they're able to get these
things out there and do

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:84%
these surveys, and that's why
we know where the asteroids are

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:90%
and what they contain.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:84%
The next effort is to put a
piece of equipment out there

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:84%
and actually mine an asteroid
or move the asteroid.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't the
Japanese land on an asteroid

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:90%
and launch off it?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Successfully,
wasn't it?

00:31:21.175 --> 00:31:22.215 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:31:22.215 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's pretty
good technology.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It's a
great technology.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a great tech-- it was
all flown remote from here.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion,
do we get back to the moon

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:90%
or go to Mars next?

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Oh, we go to the
moon, for sure, first.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I say, we're two years away
from landing another robot

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.010 align:middle line:90%
on the moon.

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.530 align:middle line:84%
What the nature of that
robot is remains to be seen,

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.680 align:middle line:84%
whether it's going to
take actual samples

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.180 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's just going to
drive around and take pictures

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.772 align:middle line:90%
like the Chinese one.

00:31:50.772 --> 00:31:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't we have enough
pictures of the moon already?

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.355 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: That's what I say.

00:31:54.355 --> 00:31:56.530 align:middle line:84%
We have some very
high resolution shots

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.150 align:middle line:84%
that we collected courtesy
of the Chinese probe that

00:31:59.150 --> 00:31:59.950 align:middle line:90%
went around.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:84%
They put a high-resolution
camera about 80 miles up,

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:90%
which was pretty close--

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --and did a
great job of returning

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.220 align:middle line:90%
a lot of information to us.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
That's why we know so much
about the volcanic vents.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.310 align:middle line:84%
But if we put a probe
on the south pole

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and we actually check out
the Shackleford crater

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out
to be what we think

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.720 align:middle line:84%
it is, if-- the only
test we've ever done

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:29.330 align:middle line:84%
was the Elcon mission, which was
kind of an improvised mission.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It was a two-piece
spacecraft, and it

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:34.130 align:middle line:84%
was built with a bunch
of spectrometers on it

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:90%
to measure emissions.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And the front part of
it actually failed.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So they decided to launch
the front part of it,

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:45.740 align:middle line:84%
detach it, and let
it fall to the moon.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.770 align:middle line:84%
The spectrometer part of
it chased it to the moon.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was,
when the front part

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.350 align:middle line:84%
struck the moon, of
course, it made a crater,

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and a big plume of dust
and water and everything

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.340 align:middle line:90%
flew up in the air.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:84%
A few minutes later, the
spectrographic section

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.810 align:middle line:90%
flew through that cloud--

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --sent its
message to Earth

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and then smashed
into the moon itself.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.540 align:middle line:84%
We got that
information, and that's

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.210 align:middle line:84%
how we know what's
in that crater.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long would
we colonize the moon

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.340 align:middle line:84%
with an individual
before we replace him?

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It's a good question.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.540 align:middle line:84%
We probably would
replace them about

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.480 align:middle line:84%
as often as we do space
station people, which

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.360 align:middle line:90%
is less than a year.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: But with
some gravity, a lot

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:36.170 align:middle line:84%
of the systems, the physiology,
will still work with humans.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:40.340 align:middle line:84%
The thing that tests
the imagination

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.610 align:middle line:84%
is, what does the second
generation do on the moon?

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:48.330 align:middle line:84%
A person born on the moon
could never return to Earth.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Because the
gravity would crush them.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Even if they were born in some
area that was atmospheric?

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yes, because
that they would only

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.070 align:middle line:84%
have one sixth the
gravity to work

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.100 align:middle line:84%
on their bones, their muscles,
the development of their body.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Their body would adapt.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.429 align:middle line:90%
The chromosomes in their body--

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.372 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --would adapt
to that environment.

00:34:10.372 --> 00:34:14.159 align:middle line:84%
That person would be perfectly
able to withstand 60 pounds

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.150 align:middle line:90%
or 70 pounds of body weight.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:84%
But if you brought
them back to Earth,

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:19.830 align:middle line:90%
they'd weigh 360 pounds--

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly?

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.587 align:middle line:90%
Instantly?

00:34:22.587 --> 00:34:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: --in a relative
way to their bones.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.290 align:middle line:90%
It would be like you--

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would feel
the pressure of that.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yea.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:28.917 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't know that.

00:34:28.917 --> 00:34:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So if an infant is born in
space, they're not coming back.

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Correct.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a life
that would be, Brooks.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That would be a
different civilization.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.949 align:middle line:84%
But once that
frontier is created,

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:46.335 align:middle line:84%
that's where that 1,000
years of peace comes from.

00:34:46.335 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert Zubrin--
do you know Robert--

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:90%
heads up the Mars Society--

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:54.239 align:middle line:84%
has been talking about going
back to Mars with people,

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.280 align:middle line:90%
see what happens.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.490 align:middle line:10%
Once we go to Mars and we
start establishing bases,

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.440 align:middle line:10%
are we going to
replace these people?

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.140 align:middle line:10%
Like, you're going to
be there for a year,

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.457 align:middle line:10%
then we take you out and
put somebody else in.

00:35:06.457 --> 00:35:08.040 align:middle line:10%
Or are they going
to stay permanently?

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.450 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be their planet?

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBERT ZUBRIN: Well, I
think, once again, what

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:10%
you'll see first
are the explorers,

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.000 align:middle line:10%
and then you'll
see the settlers.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.852 align:middle line:10%
And explorers go round trip,
and settlers go one way.

00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:21.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they do.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.600 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: That's what we saw in
the early history of America.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:29.130 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we're
going to see on Mars.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:31.530 align:middle line:10%
And in terms of
gender composition,

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.690 align:middle line:10%
I think the explorers, by
the nature of the thing,

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.100 align:middle line:10%
tend to be mostly men.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:39.210 align:middle line:10%
Settlers will be 50/50, because
men can open a frontier,

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.710 align:middle line:10%
but it takes women
to conquer it.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:44.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And this will be all
geared toward terraforming Mars

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.730 align:middle line:10%
eventually so they
don't have to wear gas--

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.350 align:middle line:10%
oxygen masks and
things like that?

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.880 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Well it
goes in stages.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.270 align:middle line:10%
The first, the explorers,
they want to learn about Mars,

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:55.350 align:middle line:10%
want to learn where
the resources are.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They want to see
things, look at fossils,

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:57.780 align:middle line:10%
if there are any.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.280 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, there's that.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Everything.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.860 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: There's the
scientific exploration,

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:10%
but there's also
the prospecting--

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.550 align:middle line:10%
find out where
the resources are,

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.740 align:middle line:10%
find out where we can
drill and bring up

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.420 align:middle line:10%
geothermally-heated
water to give us

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.370 align:middle line:10%
hot water and power and
all kinds of things,

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:12.150 align:middle line:10%
find out where other resources
are, stuff like that,

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:middle line:10%
and maybe do some heavy work,
establish the first greenhouses

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.470 align:middle line:10%
to get them going so
that they'll be up

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:10%
and running when the
colonists show up.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:10%
You've got your farms
already running.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:10%
Then you get the colonists.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:10%
And they go there.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.620 align:middle line:10%
And yes, they're going
to want to greatly expand

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.940 align:middle line:10%
the greenhouse
agricultural base.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:10%
They're farmers.

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:32.820 align:middle line:10%
They're miners.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.100 align:middle line:10%
They're builders.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.680 align:middle line:10%
And then after the farmers,
miners, and builders

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.640 align:middle line:10%
come the teachers and the
community orchestra conductors

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:10%
and the publishers and
those kinds of people,

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle line:10%
and you create a society.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.560 align:middle line:10%
And then, once this
is well established

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:10%
and it is developing apace,
then you begin the question of,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.640 align:middle line:10%
how do we terraform Mars?

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.730 align:middle line:10%
So first, we got to
do the reconnaissance.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.260 align:middle line:10%
Then we got to dig in.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.330 align:middle line:10%
Then we got to take the beach.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.580 align:middle line:10%
And then we take the continent.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is Robert
realistic, Brooks?

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Well, yes.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.030 align:middle line:84%
There are some pieces
that go in order.

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:18.960 align:middle line:84%
When you first go to Mars,
the first thing to do

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.805 align:middle line:90%
is to send supplies.

00:37:19.805 --> 00:37:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And just
get them there.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: And that will happen--

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:22.730 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:26.340 align:middle line:84%
You'll send food and buildings
and all kinds of habitats

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.510 align:middle line:90%
and everything to the moon.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Try to land them as close
as possible to one another.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll
send up people that

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.580 align:middle line:84%
will assemble all that
stuff, put it together, make

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.850 align:middle line:84%
it function, kind of like
the movie "The Martian."

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you grow from
that, when you actually

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.800 align:middle line:84%
have a colony spot
that will support life,

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.590 align:middle line:84%
you have a stable
life support system

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.110 align:middle line:84%
with plenty of food
and plenty of shelter,

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.870 align:middle line:84%
then you can send
up the next crew.

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I think, that phase,
we're probably

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:58.740 align:middle line:84%
looking at 20 to 25 years to get
that done, to get to the point

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.500 align:middle line:84%
where we can put colonists on
Mars in these small habitats.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And as you've
said before, too,

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.390 align:middle line:84%
water is going to
be a huge issue.

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Water's a huge thing.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.557 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you get
enough water up there?

00:38:09.557 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Well, you recycle some.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we
don't know about Mars--

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and we're sending another rover
up there now to check this

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:19.080 align:middle line:90%
out--

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.420 align:middle line:84%
is we don't know what's
under the surface of Mars.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.730 align:middle line:90%
We think solid water, right?

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, we've
taken what we call

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.720 align:middle line:90%
ground probing radar shots.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But the way this
technology works,

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.470 align:middle line:84%
they have a signal
that's launched

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:90%
from space to the Earth.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you have receiving
antennas on the Mars itself,

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.720 align:middle line:90%
picking up those signals.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.410 align:middle line:84%
It's only good for maybe
2,000 or 3,000 feet

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.640 align:middle line:90%
below the surface.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Can't really get
that deep when you're

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.840 align:middle line:90%
launching a signal from space.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:84%
We need to put the source of
the signal right on the surface

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and then beam it into the
planet and then receive it

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:56.910 align:middle line:90%
from another location.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.380 align:middle line:90%
That's two antennas.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.390 align:middle line:84%
That gives you
some triangulation.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Now you can tell depth and
the quantity and quality

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.880 align:middle line:84%
of the substrata we
haven't done that yet.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I know,
there's nothing in the works

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to go on a launch engine
for the next five years.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So we have to do
that first before we

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.160 align:middle line:84%
can talk about recovering
water from Mars.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before we colonize
any of these places,

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:25.392 align:middle line:84%
is the plan to stay there
for a long, long time?

00:39:25.392 --> 00:39:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, that's the
plan, to create a frontier.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the most recent
discoveries we made about Mars,

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.280 align:middle line:90%
we made a mistake.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.680 align:middle line:84%
We took some spectrographic
readings of the atmosphere,

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.097 align:middle line:84%
and we thought
that the atmosphere

00:39:36.097 --> 00:39:37.780 align:middle line:90%
didn't hold much water at all.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But now we see that the
atmosphere is actually

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:44.590 align:middle line:84%
about 300% supersaturated
with chemical water.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So we need a way to recover
that water from the atmosphere.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think
we need to do this?

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.150 align:middle line:90%
We need to go and colonize?

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, I think so.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It's-- why stay here
and just stay stable?

00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Earth has a record of many
zeniths of human races

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.570 align:middle line:90%
before us.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:03.410 align:middle line:90%
They flourished.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:04.160 align:middle line:90%
They've prospered.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And they've destroyed
themselves--

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they perished.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: --and died out.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.810 align:middle line:90%
And then we start over again.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:10.080 align:middle line:90%
This is our time.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We now finally have the
technology, the people,

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:16.680 align:middle line:84%
the health, the population
that we can do this.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this is--
we're destined to do it.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 500 years from now,
how do you envision Mars?

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: You know,
it's interesting.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.830 align:middle line:84%
This kind of effort
is always preempted

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.020 align:middle line:90%
by science fiction writers.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And I have to
reflect to the series

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:37.490 align:middle line:90%
"The Expanse" that's on Amazon.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.800 align:middle line:84%
That's about 500
years in the future.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.270 align:middle line:10%
And the way they have
portrayed what society

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.020 align:middle line:10%
will be like-- it's a
little on the darker

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.270 align:middle line:10%
side with the geopolitical
forces and everything.

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:50.450 align:middle line:10%
But the technology is spot on.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what they have done
in that science fiction series

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.580 align:middle line:90%
is what we would do.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's going to happen.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, first
we develop the moon

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.710 align:middle line:90%
and get the fuel source.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.170 align:middle line:10%
Then we go to Mars and
start terraforming, at least

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.310 align:middle line:10%
in a regional way.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.230 align:middle line:10%
And then we start
asteroid mining.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.198 align:middle line:10%
That is the future.

00:41:08.198 --> 00:41:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.205 align:middle line:84%
Brooks, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:41:11.205 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Thank you so much.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an
amazing possibility.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.260 align:middle line:10%
How exciting to think
about the possibilities

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.140 align:middle line:10%
that we one day might
explore the moon and Mars

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:24.100 align:middle line:10%
and actually colonize those
areas until the end of time.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm Georgia Noory.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
