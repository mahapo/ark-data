>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.250 align:middle line:10%
We've got an amazing
program for you today.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:10%
Whitley Strieber is with us,
the author of "Communion."

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:10%
That was the 1988
book that initiated

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:10%
awareness of ET contacts
with millions of people.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:84%
He has since written seven books
about the contact experience,

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.630 align:middle line:84%
the most recent of
which is "Them."

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.963 align:middle line:90%
Whitley, welcome to the program.

00:00:40.963 --> 00:00:42.963 align:middle line:84%
>>WHITLEY STRIEBER: I'm
glad to be here, George.

00:00:42.963 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:90%
It's always exciting to be here.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You look great.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: Well, you do, too.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.335 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: Great.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I've been terrific.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Keeping busy?

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.057 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: I am keeping busy.

00:00:53.057 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm working on a new book.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And "Them" is just out
recently, so I'm a busy boy.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about "Them."

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Well, "Them" is a
very interesting story there.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, when
communion first came out,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
we began to get letters from
people who had had experiences.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Similar to yours?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Let's
put it this way.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:10%
It's a very broad range but
experiences with the beings

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.520 align:middle line:10%
with the great big black eyes.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.650 align:middle line:90%
That was the connecting tissue.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:10%
And she said, we've got
to save these letters.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:10%
I said, how can we?

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.732 align:middle line:10%
The post office
was pouring them.

00:01:32.732 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:84%
The postmen were pouring
them in heaps on the floor--

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like Santa
Claus letters, right?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.465 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Well,
yeah, but the problem

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
was these were very
personal stories.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And they all had names and
addresses all over them,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:84%
so you couldn't
just discard them.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And I did not know what to do.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:90%
I did not expect this.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I expected the usual author
response of 20 or 30 letters,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:90%
not 10,000 a week, which is--

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:90%
so I said, how can we--

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I can't possibly read
all these letters.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And she said, well, I can.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.330 align:middle line:90%
And she was telling the truth.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:90%
She did.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
She hired a secretary,
Lori Barnes.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And they worked on those
letters for 15 years.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And Anne would show
me all of the letters

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:90%
she thought I needed to read.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, I learned
that this is an incredibly

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:90%
complicated, varied experience.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.930 align:middle line:84%
It is the most
complex experience

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:90%
human beings have ever had.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:84%
We published a book called
"The Communion Letters."

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But as the years passed, I
learned more and more and more.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I have in them
the core of the book

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:90%
is 11 letters of those letters.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And they are all
analyzed with all

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.205 align:middle line:84%
of the information and insight
I have gained in the past 25

00:02:56.205 --> 00:02:57.005 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:02:57.005 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of the
information, Whitley,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.585 align:middle line:90%
in the letters would say what?

00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Oh my
goodness, George.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:90%
And this is very typical.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Multiple witnesses
experiences are very typical.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:90%
They're not unusual.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
A family of, I believe, five
had a series of encounters

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:84%
at their home over
a two-day period.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:84%
The letter-- Anne
called the letter.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
She said, this one
is very interesting.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And she called it the visitors
in the trees because they lived

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:84%
in a house which had a
very steep hill behind it,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.312 align:middle line:84%
meaning that there were trees
growing right behind the house.

00:03:38.312 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you looked
out the back windows,

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:90%
you saw into those trees.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And the first evening,
nothing unusual happened.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
One or two things that were
a little unusual happened.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
The second morning,
a little more

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
happened that was
rather unusual but not

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
enough to where anyone would
think more than give it

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.190 align:middle line:90%
a passing thought.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:84%
But then the wife goes to the
grocery store and comes back.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And the family are
out in the backyard

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
because they say there are these
little beings up in the trees.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.500 align:middle line:90%
And it was the Greys.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.582 align:middle line:90%
And they were up--

00:04:14.582 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
a number of them
were up in a tree.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And they'd built a little
platform in the tree.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So she and her oldest
daughter went upstairs on

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.190 align:middle line:90%
to the second floor.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And they could look at them
out the bathroom window.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:84%
But then one of
the Greys pointed

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
some kind of an instrument
at them, and it scared them.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And they went away
from the window.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And it went on like that
until the end of the day.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: And their story
is analyzed in this because--

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
in the book "Them" because when
you look carefully at the story,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.910 align:middle line:84%
you find that not only is it
entangled in ancient myth,

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
our own myths, but also it is
a carefully designed process

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
of exposure of these beings
to the woman, to the mother,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that she
would remember everything.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very hard
for the human mind

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:84%
to retain memories of things
that it has never seen before.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's the new
part of the book

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
because it goes through the
relationship to mythology.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And it also talks about how they
structured the whole encounter

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that the wife
would be able to tell the story

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:90%
and write it down.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you sift
through all these letters

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.900 align:middle line:90%
to pick these kinds of stories?

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: You would
have had to meet Anne,

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and then you would know
immediately how that was done.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:90%
It was not done by me.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:84%
She was the one who sifted
through all these letters

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:90%
and her secretary, Lori.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.930 align:middle line:84%
The letters, for
years, were stored

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:84%
in a storage space
in San Antonio

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:84%
because no one
was-- no one cared.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
But I thought these
letters are very important

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:90%
and someone will care.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, the letters are
in a beautiful archive

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
at Rice University in
Houston and beautifully

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
cared for and curated by
the University's Archival

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Department.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:90%
And they've all been digitized.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we speak, they're working
to anonymize the letters so

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
that there will be a digital
copy of the whole archive that's

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
anonymized and that can be used
by scholars and by the public.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And I can hardly
wait to see what

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
happens when we do things like
apply artificial intelligence

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:90%
to these letters.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your book, "Them,"
is an amazing instrument

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:84%
corroborating what's been
happening since the beginning

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:90%
of time to all these people.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Well, it
is because the thing

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:84%
is that we think of the
close encounter experience

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:90%
as a moment of contact.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what it is.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I say
a moment of contact,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
that started in the late '40s
and has been building ever

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:90%
since.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not contact
that's happening.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
It's realization
that's happening.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
We are realizing that
this is part of human life

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:90%
and always probably has been.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
cases all similar

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.207 align:middle line:84%
where there's an abduction,
that they're taken?

00:07:25.207 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: No, the
similarity in the cases

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
is the way the beings
look for the most part.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:38.360 align:middle line:84%
In the letters, there are a
huge variety of different events

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:90%
that happen.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll give you
another example.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:84%
A man I knew, we
had mutual friends.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
to talk about what

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:84%
had happened to me, to
my friends, one of them

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:84%
said, well, I know someone who
had a very strange experience,

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.630 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:58.160 align:middle line:84%
It turns out-- and I think
anyone can agree with this--

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
if you ask three or
four of your friends

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
if they've had a
strange experience,

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
they either will have had
or know someone who did.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.677 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or know somebody.

00:08:05.677 --> 00:08:06.477 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:06.477 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: So I was
introduced to this man.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:90%
He was a psychologist.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
He was also one of the
leading experts on perception.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't a clinical
psychologist,

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.390 align:middle line:84%
but he worked in the science of
understanding human perception.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And he also had what's
called exquisite vision,

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:84%
which is better
than 20/20 vision.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
He could see the moons of
Jupiter on a clear night.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With his eyes?

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:34.215 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: With his eyes.

00:08:34.215 --> 00:08:35.523 align:middle line:90%
With his eyes, exactly.

00:08:35.523 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No telescope?

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: No telescope.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.319 align:middle line:90%
So he was unusual.

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's so
critical about this.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
He was chosen on purpose,
I'm sure, by the Greys

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
because they knew
already that this would--

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:84%
that he would come
into contact with me.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And here was a man, an
expert on perception,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:84%
a PhD psychologist, who
also had superb vision.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:90%
And here is what he saw.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:84%
He was driving home down
the Grand Central Parkway

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
past LaGuardia Airport in one
evening, an October evening,

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:90%
He saw coming toward him--

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:90%
and of course, it's jam-packed.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:90%
It's rush hour.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And so at nosebleed
altitude coming toward him

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and looking like it's about
to land on the highway, a jet.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks, my God,
they've missed the runway

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.425 align:middle line:84%
because LaGuardia Airport
is just right there.

00:09:37.425 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:84%
They think they're
on the runway.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:84%
But this is going
to be a catastrophe.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But as it goes over his
car, he sees that it is not

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:90%
a jet, that it is--

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:84%
he said it looked like a
cardboard, a giant cardboard

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:90%
model of a jet.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.032 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't real.

00:09:55.032 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it was the
strangest thing I'd ever seen

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and what it was doing in flying
and how it could even fly.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:90%
I was just mystified.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And then as he looks down,
he notices on the roadside

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:90%
this sign up on the shoulder.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And there are hieroglyphs
flashing past on the sign.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks,
what in the world?

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.890 align:middle line:90%
No one can read that.

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And then he sees on the
little back up the shoulder,

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:84%
just in the shadows
beside the road,

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:90%
a circle of people standing.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks, I'm going to
find out what in the world.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:90%
This is really highly strange.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So he pulls off
onto the shoulder.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And he walks over to
this circle of people.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And he says, they're all
standing there with their heads

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, what he's
described as a little dwarf,

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
which I think we all know what
that was, comes up to him--

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
he's never had any
contact experience,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:84%
knows nothing
about any of that--

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.050 align:middle line:84%
looks up at him
and says, get out

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.900 align:middle line:90%
of here, which he decides to do.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.626 align:middle line:84%
And he gets the hell
back in his car.

00:11:03.626 --> 00:11:05.563 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without any
hesitation at all.

00:11:05.563 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: None whatsoever.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:90%
No, he was agreeing.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:90%
He agreed that was a good idea.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And so he drove off and
told his family the story.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those stories
where people say, yeah, wow,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.730 align:middle line:90%
that's really weird.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:90%
And you go on to the next thing.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Then I came into his friend's--

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I think they were cousins,
actually, his cousin's life.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And I told him my story
that would become the book

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:90%
"Communion" a year or so later.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.070 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, you've got to
meet him because he had this.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's another example.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Now, is that an abduction?

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.087 align:middle line:90%
No, not an abduction at all.

00:11:42.087 --> 00:11:43.545 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But a
great contact story.

00:11:43.545 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: An
incredible contact story.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a story
of a woman in Australia

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.365 align:middle line:90%
who may have been abducted.

00:11:50.365 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: This is
a more classic case,

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and it haunts me to this
day because it's also

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:84%
a story that I have lived
and many people have lived.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Here's the situation.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
She is vacuuming her
floor in the morning.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
She lives in a
suburb of Australia.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.540 align:middle line:90%
She's a schoolteacher.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, her husband's
gone off to work.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And she has the
day off that day.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:90%
So he has left.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:90%
She's vacuuming.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.540 align:middle line:90%
And she notices movement.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And she looks over.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And standing beside the couch
is a Grey, the classic Grey.

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Typical.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:84%
3-foot tall, big
head, dark eyes.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.601 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: Right.

00:12:35.601 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And beside him are two shorter
beings like the dwarf ones,

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:90%
the wide faces.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:90%
But they're wearing brown cowls.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And she receives in her
mind the instruction,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:90%
you will come with us.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.606 align:middle line:84%
But she did not want
to go with them.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:57.170 align:middle line:90%
And so she says, I won't.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:90%
And he says, you cannot resist.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:90%
You will come with us.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And there follows a tussle
where she turns around and tries

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:90%
to run out of the house.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
She's dragged back with
the mind, not physically.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:84%
She ends up down on
her hands and knees,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:90%
trying to get out of that house.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And she's pulled back again
and again and told again

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and again, you
will come with us.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Finally, she finds
herself, her husband

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:90%
standing in front of her.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And she thinks, thank
God he came home.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And she embraces him.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.050 align:middle line:90%
And she can smell his sweater.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And he just disappears
in her arms, not there.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And they repeat, you
will come with us.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Then, seemingly with no lapse
in time, her husband is back.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And she at first doesn't believe
it's really him, but it is him.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And hours have passed
that she has no memory

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:90%
of those hours at all.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And the last line of this
letter sums up a question

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that so many people have,
where did that time go?

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:90%
She never found out.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:90%
She tried hypnosis.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:84%
She tried breathing techniques
and all kinds of things.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:90%
She never found out.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.542 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the story about
"The Call of the Morlocks."

00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: "The Call of the
Morlocks," what a story that is,

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:84%
The story I just told
about the man who

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
saw the beings on
the roadside, there

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:84%
was another man who
read that story.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And we had something called the
communion letter at the time.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And he read the story
in our newsletter.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
We don't have it
anymore, we did then.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:84%
He immediately
recognized everything

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.545 align:middle line:90%
because he had seen it, too.

00:15:01.545 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:90%
He was a second witness.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And he told his story,
which was very similar.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:84%
But the difference was that
he had seen the first man

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:84%
that I talked about a moment
ago get out of his car

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.310 align:middle line:90%
and walk over to these.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And he had done the same thing
and had been stopped and told,

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.166 align:middle line:84%
if you don't get out of
here, we will hurt you.

00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:35.206 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A threatening--
visitation.

00:15:35.206 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: Yeah.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
It was very
threatening because we

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:84%
will hurt you coming
from someone like that,

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:90%
that might mean a great deal.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
not common, is it?

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: No,
no, it's not common

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle line:84%
that they say-- they don't
threaten people much.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But then again, they
don't need to, do they?

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.422 align:middle line:84%
Because they're usually
in complete control

00:15:52.422 --> 00:15:54.550 align:middle line:90%
of the situation.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:90%
He left the area as well.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But I call it "Call of the
Morlocks" for this reason.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
There is a book called "The
Time Machine" by H.G. Wells.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end of time,
he builds his time machine

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and goes through the
future, through war,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:84%
after war, and
mayhem and mayhem.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he comes to
a beautiful era of peace

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
where the people
are called the Eloi.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And they live in a beautiful
Garden of Eden-like setting.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Everything is provided for them.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
They've got plenty of
food, everything they need.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.575 align:middle line:84%
And he's really
relating to the Eloi.

00:16:35.575 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And he's so glad that this is
how the human species first

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.360 align:middle line:90%
ended up until the sirens start.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And the people all hypnotized
go into these dark,

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.700 align:middle line:90%
cave-like structures--

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All in unison.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: --all in unison.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And underground are these
horrible misshaped creatures

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:90%
called the Morlocks.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And the Morlocks are actually--

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:84%
the Eloi are the
food of the Morlocks.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I asked myself
the question,

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:84%
who were those people
standing in the circle?

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Did they know what they were
and what they were doing?

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And how many of us end up
standing in circles like that?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:84%
How many of us do
things with the visitors

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:90%
that we know nothing about?

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's called
"Call of the Morlocks."

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When this
episode happened to you,

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:90%
did you know what was going on?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.675 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: The
first experience?

00:17:38.675 --> 00:17:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The first time.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: I certainly didn't.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I had seen something in
the doorway of my bedroom--

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:84%
a very odd figure with a big
sort of like a World War I army

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.800 align:middle line:84%
helmet on but with a wider
brim and a shield on its chest.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I was looking at that
and thinking, what is this?

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:90%
This is not real.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Am I dreaming?

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.335 align:middle line:84%
And then the next thing
I knew, I woke up.

00:18:13.335 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Something was wrong.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of the fact that
there was someone in the room.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I fully
opened my eyes, I

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.670 align:middle line:90%
wasn't even in my room anymore.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:84%
I was in another room, a
little crowded, round room.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And there were what I perceived
to be huge insects in the room.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And my initial thought
was, it's a nightmare.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And I actually
crossed my mind, maybe

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:84%
I could write a novel based
on this, a horror novel,

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.120 align:middle line:90%
because I had written some.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.412 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't written them in years.

00:18:50.412 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But I'd written some in the
early part of my career.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't make it go away.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
kept waking myself up,

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.800 align:middle line:84%
but I was still in the room
and still with these beings.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, it became
impossible to determine--

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't understand it.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But it seemed like it was a
real thing that was happening.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close was
the movie, "Communion,"

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:84%
with Christopher Walken based
on your book, to Your Reality?

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Well, certain
parts of the movie

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:90%
are emotionally authentic.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:84%
The close encounters
isn't the same.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel like what
happened to me at all.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:90%
I didn't dance, for example.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.250 align:middle line:84%
First of all, as
my wife would have

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.730 align:middle line:84%
told you had she been
with us, he is no dancer.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And second, I'm not Christopher
Walken, in other words.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And he loves to
dance in his movies.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.222 align:middle line:84%
And I don't blame him, because
he's a wonderful dancer.

00:19:44.222 --> 00:19:45.865 align:middle line:90%
But I don't dance.

00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And the whole tone
of the movie was--

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:84%
he was a little bit more
overstated than I am.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:90%
I tend to be rather quiet.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
making a movie.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And the main character can't be
the Silent Sam, which I usually

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:90%
am.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And so they made it
into another character,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:90%
and I can't blame him for that.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.832 align:middle line:90%
It's not accurate, though.

00:20:05.832 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that's accurate
is the emotional authenticity

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.120 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
could feel that?

00:20:12.495 --> 00:20:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Yeah,
I felt that way,

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:84%
the way Chris is
when he shoots off

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.380 align:middle line:90%
the gun in the house and stuff.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:84%
I never shot a gun
off in the house.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:84%
But all of that,
that's very real.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think,
Whitley, the hybridization

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.470 align:middle line:90%
program is?

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a cloning program.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.005 align:middle line:90%
What's going on.

00:20:30.005 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Oh, George,
what a question.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I had semen removed
from my body.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:84%
The nerve that causes
sexual emotions

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:44.320 align:middle line:84%
was stimulated electrically,
which can be done.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not science fiction.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:84%
It's done all the time
in animal husbandry.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And it used to be
before Viagra that it

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:84%
would be used for men who
otherwise could not succeed.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And that was done to me.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And they took
ejaculate out of me.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Many women report eggs
being taken from them.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Other men have the
same experience I did.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you think to yourself,
Why would they be doing that?

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:84%
it would seem to
me also women have

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.955 align:middle line:90%
fetuses removed and disappear.

00:21:22.955 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:84%
You think to yourself, well,
why would they be doing that?

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is they're doing
it because they're using the--

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.045 align:middle line:90%
I think they're making hybrids.

00:21:32.045 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why, though?

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you, but why?

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: I think that
they are trying to join us.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:90%
I have speculated--

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.466 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or take over.

00:21:44.466 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: I'm not sure that--

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I think when I say join
us, the two species

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:84%
would become so symbiotic that
wouldn't even be an issue.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.160 align:middle line:90%
In other words, we would be one.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why she called
the book "Communion"

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
because she thought
that would be--

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't think it would
necessarily be a bad thing.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.290 align:middle line:90%
But I'm unsure.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:90%
I really am unsure about that.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I've been with
them now for years.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
They've been part of my
life for a very long time.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And I think of them as--

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:84%
well, I think the bodies
they have are something

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:84%
that they enter like we
would enter a diving suit

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
or put on clothes, that
they are not basically

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.060 align:middle line:90%
a physical species.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I have thought to
myself, maybe what

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
we have here is a
species that went extinct

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and has built something
that enables it to penetrate

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.560 align:middle line:84%
into the physical
world again and is now

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
trying to meld with us, to
in effect come back to life.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could that be
they need us to rebuild?

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Yeah, they need us
because it's obvious if they're

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:90%
taking sexual material from us.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you don't think
there's anything nefarious here?

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: I would
not go that far.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.830 align:middle line:84%
The answer is I don't
know the answer to that.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
I would say that we need to
try to cut the cards ourselves.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:84%
We need to try to keep
control of the situation

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.410 align:middle line:84%
as best we can because
there have been

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:84%
some indications that
there are hybrids

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and that they aren't
particularly friendly toward us

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.180 align:middle line:90%
or very scared of us, perhaps.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
think they are hybrids.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:10%
But I've met a few.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:10%
And one thing
about them at least

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:10%
that I've encountered that
is immediately obvious

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.955 align:middle line:10%
is that they can
enter your mind.

00:23:45.955 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:90%
They're telepathic.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
know what they are?

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Yeah, the ones
I've met all definitely do.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And they stick together.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you had
one living on your property

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.250 align:middle line:90%
in New York, didn't you?

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: We did.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
That was right before we
left and moved to Texas.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was in 1995,
1996, something like that.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.510 align:middle line:84%
We began to notice
cigarette smoke

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:14.290 align:middle line:84%
in the air, which was
disturbing because the house was

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:90%
fairly isolated.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.496 align:middle line:84%
It was not that isolated,
but it was somewhat isolated.

00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
one around there

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:84%
near the house who
should be smoking.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And by this time, I
was pretty famous.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:29.630 align:middle line:90%
And so we were nervous about it.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we would find
these places in the woods

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:84%
where there were hundreds
of cigarette butts.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I found what
looked like a boy

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:84%
sitting out in the woods
smoking cigarettes.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And I went up to him
because he was right just

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.990 align:middle line:84%
below a stand of pitch pines
which are very flammable.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
I don't like that boy.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he looked like
11- or 12-year-old boy.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.613 align:middle line:84%
He's smoking, and he's
right near the pitch pines.

00:25:02.613 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:90%
And so I walked over to him.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.970 align:middle line:90%
And I started to talk to him.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I had
gotten close to him,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.780 align:middle line:84%
there was obviously
something way, way off.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was about a mile
back in the woods.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Just me and him were the
only people back there.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And I leaned down and
I said, excuse me.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And he's sitting
there like this.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:90%
He goes, [GROANS].

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think to myself,
time to go home.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm leaving this--

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's wrong here.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.007 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Something's
very wrong here.

00:25:36.007 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very far away.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.690 align:middle line:90%
So I go back to the house.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.060 align:middle line:90%
And then I tell Anne about him.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:90%
And he comes closer.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.777 align:middle line:84%
The next thing we know he's
standing in the woods at night.

00:25:47.777 --> 00:25:49.235 align:middle line:84%
Our swimming pool
was very private.

00:25:49.235 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could see him?

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.075 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Yeah, we
could see him shadowy.

00:25:53.075 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:90%
You knew he was there.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.050 align:middle line:90%
You could see him.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And the cigarette smoke smell
was very oppressive on nights

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:90%
when the air was still.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So it was not pleasant
to have him around.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is your acreage?

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.370 align:middle line:90%
He's trespassing out the get-go.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:90%
And the pool was very private.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And we would skinny-dip in
the evenings quite often.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And we went skinny-dipping
after he had come up

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and was hanging
out near the house.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And the woods were in full
leaf, so you couldn't see.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the deck,
you couldn't see.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.290 align:middle line:90%
It was an arbor.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there were
a lot of bushes and trees.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But behind that, it was
all open under the trees.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing growing
because it's too dark.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:90%
So we're skinny-dipping.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And he starts running
back and forth.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:84%
You can hear him
running back and forth,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.280 align:middle line:90%
cracking sticks, and gasping.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:84%
He could not talk and
obviously very upset

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:90%
that we are naked and outdoors.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
going to skinny-dip

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:90%
under circumstances like that.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:58.410 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:90%
So we went back in the house.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.660 align:middle line:90%
And that fun was ruined.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're saying to
ourselves, what in the world

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:06.720 align:middle line:90%
is going on here.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like he's trying
to protect us somehow.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And so a few weeks
later, we leave.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:90%
And we go to Texas.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, we get-- now
we've lost the cabin because we

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:90%
had a lot of--

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the machinery of the culture
was really working against me.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And my book sales
had dried up, of even

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:90%
my nonalien-related books.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.170 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a little
condo on the street corner,

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.710 align:middle line:90%
literally on a street.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's got a porch.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
cul-de-sac beside the porch.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.450 align:middle line:90%
And beyond that is a wall.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And the bedroom's right on
the other side of the wall.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.010 align:middle line:90%
So we're there.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking at least we've
left that weirdness behind

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:84%
until one night I smell, not
even a week after we got there,

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:90%
cigarette smoke.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: And I think,
holy moly, that can't be.

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But he stands in the
cul-de-sac at night.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I go out on the porch,
and he immediately

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:10.050 align:middle line:90%
goes around the corner.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.455 align:middle line:90%
But I could see it was him.

00:28:11.455 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same kid?

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.558 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Well,
that I can't say,

00:28:15.558 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:84%
but he sure looked
like the same kid.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing
the same things.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:90%
So here he is again.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:90%
And I say, Anne, he's here.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I think,
we'll ignore it.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.330 align:middle line:90%
But then I feel him in my mind.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:90%
I can feel his--

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:34.050 align:middle line:90%
it's uncanny, George.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.420 align:middle line:84%
There are no words
to express this

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
a human experience

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:84%
to feel another being
inside your own mind.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:90%
It's really weird.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going
to sleep like that.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:52.840 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I install a
motion-sensitive light.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And oh, he's being
noticed by the neighbors.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Someone saw him climbing up one
of the walls of the building.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And he tore the spokes
out of the bicycle

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.440 align:middle line:84%
tires of this nice young couple
who lived on the second floor.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.000 align:middle line:90%
And he got up on their deck.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.860 align:middle line:84%
What in the world
was that about?

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.470 align:middle line:90%
And then it develops.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
He's actually living in
the condo right behind ours

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.320 align:middle line:90%
with these two men who--

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:29.045 align:middle line:84%
they were very weird
and creepy men.

00:29:29.045 --> 00:29:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were all hybrids.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: I don't
know what they were.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.580 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they were hybrids.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.820 align:middle line:84%
But if so, they were
hybridized with demons, not

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:90%
with human beings.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:84%
They were really,
really, really scary.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So I call the managing
agent of the condo

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and I say that these
people are living there.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.382 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to
know more about--

00:29:48.382 --> 00:29:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who they were.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Yeah, because
he stands outside our place

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:90%
at night, et cetera.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.967 align:middle line:90%
And the managing agent says--

00:29:56.967 --> 00:29:58.300 align:middle line:90%
I give him the apartment number.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, there's
no one living there.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I said, well there are
three people living there.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, listen,
I'm going to give you

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:90%
the phone number of the owner.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.510 align:middle line:84%
You can call him if you
see if he's got tenants

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.040 align:middle line:84%
because being a
condo, they don't

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
have to necessarily
report to the management

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.450 align:middle line:84%
whether or not
they've got tenants.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.310 align:middle line:90%
So I call the guy.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:90%
He's in Houston.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:90%
He says, I don't have tenants.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I just use that
when I go up there

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.392 align:middle line:90%
for business in San Antonio.

00:30:26.392 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, there's
three people living

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.780 align:middle line:90%
in it, two men and a boy.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, you're kidding.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I said, nope, they are there.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:90%
And the boy is causing trouble.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:37.972 align:middle line:90%
He's vandalizing things--

00:30:37.972 --> 00:30:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the neighborhood.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: --in the condo.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I'm going to take
care of it, don't you worry.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So a couple days
pass and there's

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:90%
an eviction notice on the door.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.340 align:middle line:84%
By now, everybody in the condo
knows about this weird situation

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.250 align:middle line:90%
with these men.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't know the mental,
mind stuff or anything.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And they certainly don't
know the boy was in my woods.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.930 align:middle line:84%
But they do know that
there's this weird boy

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.480 align:middle line:90%
and these men are creepy.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows that.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And they also know now
that they are being evicted

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.220 align:middle line:90%
because they're squatters.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And they go around, the
two men, not the boy,

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.710 align:middle line:84%
go around from
door to door trying

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.335 align:middle line:84%
to sell the guy's
furniture to us.

00:31:26.335 --> 00:31:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Holy Toledo.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: I mean,
what is this about?

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:84%
A totally out to
lunch and no idea

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.840 align:middle line:84%
of what they're doing,
obviously have no money.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is what they
can come up with.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.190 align:middle line:84%
If they're aliens and
they're trying to live here,

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.620 align:middle line:84%
they got a lot of work to
do because this is not--

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Did they end up
just disappearing?

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: The two
men just disappeared.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But the boy, one morning
during that time,

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I was out in the little
garden that we had.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly he goes,
bursts around the corner

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and goes marching
off down the street.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And he's got the cigarette
in the center of his mouth.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think to myself, he
doesn't even know how to smoke.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.710 align:middle line:84%
He grabs the cigarette
out of his mouth

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and holds it beside him
the second he heard--

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.330 align:middle line:90%
he obviously heard my thought.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:19.930 align:middle line:90%
And off he goes.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a real
story, you understand?

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.243 align:middle line:90%
This is the real thing.

00:32:23.243 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I believe it.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: This is what
happens in the real world.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.320 align:middle line:90%
A lot else happens too.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And not all of it is creepy
like this, thank goodness.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.120 align:middle line:84%
But this is my
experience of hybrids.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what
point, Whitley, did

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.693 align:middle line:84%
the military get involved
with encountering ETs?

00:32:39.693 --> 00:32:45.120 align:middle line:90%


00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Well,
after I wrote them,

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that an Italian
researcher had nailed down

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:57.650 align:middle line:90%
the fact--

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and I say nailed down, his
research is excellent--

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that there was a UFO
crash in Italy in 1933.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:90%
That UFO after the war--

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.580 align:middle line:84%
during the war, it was examined
by the Germans and the Italians.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.170 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't make
anything of it.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.002 align:middle line:84%
After the war was taken to
the Air Materiel Command,

00:33:19.002 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't make
anything of it either.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I doubt that they
even thought of it

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.250 align:middle line:90%
as an alien spacecraft.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.850 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't
know what it was.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably
thought it was ours.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.347 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Well, no, I think
the Germans thought it was ours,

00:33:31.347 --> 00:33:32.555 align:middle line:90%
and we thought it was theirs.

00:33:32.555 --> 00:33:33.978 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:33:33.978 --> 00:33:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: And it turned out
to be somebody else's entirely.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, that
was already there,

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure, and being
ignored because nobody

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.690 align:middle line:90%
knew what to make of it.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:84%
When the Roswell
incident happened--

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.886 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In 1947.

00:33:48.886 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Yeah, and that
cast a different light on it

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.610 align:middle line:84%
because what
crashed in Roswell--

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:55.410 align:middle line:90%
you understand?

00:33:55.410 --> 00:34:00.840 align:middle line:84%
One of my uncles was an
officer at Air Materiel

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.190 align:middle line:84%
during this period and was there
when the material was brought

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:09.690 align:middle line:84%
in, so I understand and
I respect the Air Force's

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:10.960 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a hopeless
situation they're in.

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to dump
on them because they are--

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say it, but not
telling the truth about this.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:84%
General Arthur Exon, who was
a close friend of my uncle's,

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.659 align:middle line:84%
not only did he
examine the materials,

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:32.010 align:middle line:84%
he also experienced-- he
was witness to the bodies.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:35.400 align:middle line:90%
So this happened.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.889 align:middle line:84%
The bodies and the
materials were brought

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:40.139 align:middle line:90%
to Wright Field from Roswell.

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's in my
family's knowledge.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry, but my
uncle was not a liar

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:90%
and neither was General Exon.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So I will not be
dissuaded by people

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.679 align:middle line:90%
claiming that didn't happen.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:90%
It did happen.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:35:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to understand the
header Air Materiel at that time

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:90%
was General Nathan Twining.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
In 1946, General Twining had
been converted to Catholicism

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.430 align:middle line:90%
by Padre Pio, the--

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.255 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stigmata.

00:35:12.255 --> 00:35:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: --the Italian saint.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:18.280 align:middle line:84%
He was the commanding
officer of the--

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the 15th Air
Force in Italy at the time.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And he encountered Padre
Pio and was very inspired

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.050 align:middle line:90%
by him apparently.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.580 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to find that.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.860 align:middle line:84%
You won't find it on
his Wikipedia page

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:34.030 align:middle line:84%
because the Air Force does
not like the religious beliefs

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:84%
of its officers to be revealed
publicly because of respect

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.520 align:middle line:84%
for separation of
church and state.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.800 align:middle line:90%
But you can find it.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:90%
And it is quite true.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.190 align:middle line:90%
He did convert to Catholicism.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So here he is, a recent
Catholic convert.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.220 align:middle line:90%
His confessor is Padre Pio.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they get
these materials and bodies.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Understand this is
not a time when we are

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.395 align:middle line:90%
thinking in terms of aliens.

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:05.195 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:36:05.195 --> 00:36:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The war had just
ended a couple of years--

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: And we're
thinking in terms of threat.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:84%
These are all
warriors, these guys.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.620 align:middle line:90%
All these generals have been--

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Curtis LeMay just blew
up Japan and burned it.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.120 align:middle line:84%
These are soldiers and
these are warriors.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they decide--

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.470 align:middle line:84%
so they decide
it's a scout ship.

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And some of them fear that
these beings are demons

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:35.200 align:middle line:84%
because the idea of
people from another world

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:90%
is not really very--

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:84%
not a very prominent idea,
but the idea that it's demons

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and demons must
travel in conveyances,

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.450 align:middle line:90%
unlike angels who can fly.

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So these two things get into
the Air Force culture together.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.990 align:middle line:90%
One, the demons fear.

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And two, scout ship
from another planet

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:84%
may be the beginning
of an invasion.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the two things that
get into the Air Force

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:90%
culture about this.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:09.620 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, they've got a
problem with the 509th Bomb Wing

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.840 align:middle line:90%
in Roswell.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:20.440 align:middle line:84%
At that point, over in Europe,
Stalin has got 4,500,000

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:24.430 align:middle line:84%
soldiers lined up along the
border that is just beginning

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:90%
to be called the Iron Curtain.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:90%
NATO analysts are saying--

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.680 align:middle line:90%
or Allied.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.140 align:middle line:90%
The NATO didn't exist yet.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Allied analysts are
saying they will

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.180 align:middle line:84%
be able to reach the
channel in two weeks

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:90%
and probably get England--

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:42.550 align:middle line:84%
in six weeks, excuse
me, and probably get

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.720 align:middle line:84%
England in another
few weeks after that.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.900 align:middle line:90%
They will not be stoppable.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, all of
them armed by Americans

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.200 align:middle line:90%
using American weapons.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing
that's stopping them

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.620 align:middle line:84%
is that little bomb
wing in Roswell

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:02.140 align:middle line:84%
because that bomb wing
has the only operational,

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.330 align:middle line:84%
deliverable atomic
weapons on the planet.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And Stalin knows
he does not have

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:14.530 align:middle line:84%
radar systems and antiaircraft
systems sufficiently robust

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to guarantee that at
least one of those bombers

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.100 align:middle line:90%
won't reach Moscow.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
incredible story, Whitley.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: So he wants to
know exactly what's really

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:33.920 align:middle line:90%
going on at that airfield.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Something unknown
crashes 30 miles north.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.830 align:middle line:90%
It's thin paper and wood.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:46.895 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they think it's some
kind of a Russian spy craft.

00:38:46.895 --> 00:38:47.855 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or balloon.

00:38:47.855 --> 00:38:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: Or balloon.

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And that it has some kind
of radiation detector

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.540 align:middle line:84%
aboard because
the very top brass

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and President Truman
apparently have a big secret.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.340 align:middle line:84%
The big secret is the 509th
is essentially a bluff.

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was President Truman,
by the way, the first president

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.955 align:middle line:90%
to become involved in UFOs?

00:39:07.955 --> 00:39:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: General Nixon said
to me, everyone from Truman

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.940 align:middle line:84%
on down knew that
what we had found

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:18.100 align:middle line:84%
was not of this world within
24 hours of our finding it.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:90%
So the answer would be yes.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they don't have that
much operational atomic hardware

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.920 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many bombs they had.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:39.200 align:middle line:84%
But I have been told by reliable
sources that the 509th was not

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.080 align:middle line:90%
fully operational and armed.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was exactly
what Stalin needed

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:48.860 align:middle line:84%
to know because if he had
found that out and been sure

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.200 align:middle line:84%
that he could take
the risk, he would

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.620 align:middle line:90%
have invaded Western Europe.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the stakes
were fantastically high.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And they were absolutely
desperate to find out

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:04.920 align:middle line:84%
exactly what that material
was and why it was there.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.194 align:middle line:90%
And that was why it was--

00:40:06.194 --> 00:40:07.527 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And where it came from.

00:40:07.527 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: --literally rushed
to Air Materiel to be analyzed.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was at Air Materiel
that it became obvious

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.975 align:middle line:84%
that the bodies they had
brought in were not human.

00:40:16.975 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have an
interesting clipping

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I want you to take a look at.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:25.320 align:middle line:10%
It was from a newspaper in
1947 about the Air Force being

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:10%
ordered to shoot down UFOs.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.985 align:middle line:10%
This is an actual real story.

00:40:29.985 --> 00:40:31.530 align:middle line:10%
>>STRIEBER: That's right.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.210 align:middle line:84%
That's a story that has
been buried, hasn't it?

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It has.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Because
they were ordered

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:39.870 align:middle line:90%
to try to shoot down UFOs.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And they did because
basically people talk about

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.670 align:middle line:90%
combat air patrol.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:84%
What a combat air patrol is,
is an Air Patrol in an area

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.570 align:middle line:84%
that is restricted
to aerial activity

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:59.700 align:middle line:84%
by anyone, except recognized
and approved aircraft.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And when a combat air
patrol goes up and confronts

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.180 align:middle line:84%
an aircraft that is not
approved and that aircraft

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:15.140 align:middle line:84%
doesn't respond, then
his job is to open fire.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure
that's probably

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:21.050 align:middle line:84%
what happened on a number
of different occasions.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And I go into that in
"Them" quite extensively.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:28.850 align:middle line:84%
We're rolling forward a
little bit from 1947 to 1952

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.960 align:middle line:90%
because this was an order.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:36.590 align:middle line:84%
It was a standing order
that unidentified aircraft

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that did not respond to
radio were to be shot down.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.690 align:middle line:10%
There's a 1952 photograph
from "The Washington Post,"

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:52.630 align:middle line:10%
I believe, that clearly shows
unidentified objects over

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:53.430 align:middle line:10%
the capital.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.670 align:middle line:10%
>>STRIEBER: That's right.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
that all about?

00:41:56.350 --> 00:42:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: Well, this
was the 1952 overflight

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:04.870 align:middle line:84%
where for night after night,
there were these objects flying

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.860 align:middle line:90%
over the capital.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Air Force was
frankly stating at the time

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.390 align:middle line:84%
that they did not
know what they were.

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:17.050 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, though,
another incident was taking

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:23.710 align:middle line:84%
place, there is an area out at
the 12-mile limit where if you

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.590 align:middle line:84%
enter that area and your
aircraft is not identified,

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:29.390 align:middle line:84%
you don't identify
your aircraft,

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.210 align:middle line:90%
it's considered hostile.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:34.310 align:middle line:84%
At the same time that these
overflights were happening,

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:39.400 align:middle line:84%
which must have been incredibly
intimidating because we would

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.120 align:middle line:84%
have known behind the
scenes by this time

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.400 align:middle line:84%
that these were not
of human origin.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And we also knew a lot
about their flight abilities

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:52.380 align:middle line:90%
and characteristics.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So that would have been very,
very concerning to the military

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and to the whole defense
establishment and the president

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.310 align:middle line:90%
much more than they let on.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:05.210 align:middle line:84%
But now what happens
is suddenly an object

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:09.860 align:middle line:84%
is seen coming on fire over
the whole eastern seaboard

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.110 align:middle line:90%
and going down in West Virginia.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a meteor,
but it's not a meteor.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: It's no
way is it a meteor.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.760 align:middle line:90%
It's moving much too slowly.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Its trajectory is all wrong.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And two state
troopers on the ground

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:29.770 align:middle line:84%
who saw it reported it
in as a crashing airplane

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:33.750 align:middle line:84%
because it was not,
absolutely not a meteor.

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, in West Virginia, in a
little town called Flatwoods,

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:43.050 align:middle line:84%
some boys see it go
down and they go out

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:90%
to see what's going on.

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:45.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that the
Flatwoods Monster story?

00:43:45.925 --> 00:43:46.725 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: Right.

00:43:46.725 --> 00:43:47.930 align:middle line:90%
We're getting there.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.400 align:middle line:90%
So they see it go down.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.726 align:middle line:84%
And they see this
terrifying monster

00:43:55.726 --> 00:43:57.860 align:middle line:90%
that they think of as a monster.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.280 align:middle line:84%
What it actually
probably was, was

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:04.100 align:middle line:84%
an escape capsule from
the ship that had crashed.

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And it had crashed because
it had been shot at out over

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.800 align:middle line:84%
the Atlantic when it passed
the 12-mile limit and did not

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.367 align:middle line:90%
identify itself.

00:44:13.367 --> 00:44:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course, what they
didn't understand

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:19.820 align:middle line:84%
was, who knows if they
even know what radio is?

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.450 align:middle line:84%
If they've developed another
method of communicating

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:29.210 align:middle line:84%
wirelessly, they might not even
have gone down the radio path.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:31.370 align:middle line:84%
They might not even
have heard the message

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:33.330 align:middle line:84%
or understood the message
if they did hear it.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably never even
had a radio in their craft.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STRIEBER: Right.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.790 align:middle line:84%
But then press, of course, makes
light of the Flatwoods Monster.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:42.940 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY]
But it probably

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:47.800 align:middle line:84%
was just nothing more, nothing
but a prosaic thing, an escape

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.560 align:middle line:90%
capsule from a damaged craft.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.372 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could it have been
the occupant in the capsule?

00:44:52.372 --> 00:44:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STRIEBER: There
was an occupant.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:55.490 align:middle line:84%
That's why it was
there, I'm sure.

00:44:55.490 --> 00:45:01.730 align:middle line:10%
The occupant-- no, no, it was
flying and maneuvering around.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.890 align:middle line:90%
And it had arms, but they were--

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:09.280 align:middle line:84%
it was obviously
robotic, whatever it was.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And so my guess is
there was someone in it.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.070 align:middle line:90%

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:14.090 align:middle line:90%

>>STRIEBER:
Controlling it, someone

00:45:15.548 --> 00:45:19.720 align:middle line:84%
who had been in the craft and
had escaped with this thing

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.855 align:middle line:84%

up some time later.
