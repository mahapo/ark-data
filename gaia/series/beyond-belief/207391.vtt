>>ROTBART: Well,
my current career

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:10%
as a sort of inspirational
[CHUCKLES] writer, if you will,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:10%
is very different
than my first career

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:10%
as a evidence-based
clinician and scientist.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And it really began
about 40 years ago

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:90%
with two parallel motivations.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
One of them was the
death of my dad.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a concentration camp
survivor, a European immigrant.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And he died tragically
of pancreatic cancer

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
at a very young age, before he
had a chance to meet my wife,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:90%
to know his grandkids.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
But I also did not have
a chance to know him

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:90%
as well as I wish I would have.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what his
worldview was coming out

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
of the camps on God, on
fate, on the Messiah.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sorry I didn't ask.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:84%
I was in the go-go years
of my young adulthood,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and there just wasn't a lot
of time to sit down and talk.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And the second motivating factor
was that, also 40 years ago, I

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:84%
took care of a child in
the intensive care unit

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:84%
at Children's Hospital
in Philadelphia, who,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:84%
for all intents and
purposes, was dead.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.830 align:middle line:84%
He was in a prolonged coma, was
never going to come out of it.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Then he walked out of the
hospital fully recovered.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Exactly.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And those two events
led me to ask colleagues

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
if they had had
similar miraculous

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
or unexplainable, unforgettable
clinical experiences.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And that resulted in a book
five years ago called "Miracles

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:90%
We Have Seen" that I wrote.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
collection of 85 essays

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
from the most respected
physicians in the country

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
describing cases that
they could never forget,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
the outcomes that they
could never have predicted,

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.380 align:middle line:90%
miraculous cases.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And those essays were
filled with the dilemma

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
of faith versus science,
of belief versus medicine.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to expand on that.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And the No Regrets Living
Project that I then undertook

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
was to try and further explore
the relationship between faith,

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
God, and evidence-based
medicine and science.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
mixture between the two

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:90%
that makes it work?

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Yes, I believe--

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and I use that
word selectively--

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe that science
is evidence for God.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm an
evidence-based physician,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:90%
evidence-based scientist.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:90%
I believe in the Big Bang.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:90%
I believe in science.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the science that
I generated in my laboratory

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:90%
I believe in that science.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe in it unless and
until it's proven wrong.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And we think back to
the time of Hippocrates,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
who had the theory of the
four humors and the four

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
temperaments, which now as
scientists and physicians,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:90%
we laugh at.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And someday, we may laugh at
the theory of the Big Bang.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
We may laugh at the
theory of virus origins.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But for right now, I'm
a believer in science.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also a realist,
and I appreciate all

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
that we do not learn
from science, everything

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.970 align:middle line:84%
that we'll never
learn from science.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And that gap between
scientific knowledge and what's

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
really out there is where
there's room for God.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's so refreshing
to hear this

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
come from a man of
science, because that

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.185 align:middle line:90%
doesn't happen a lot.

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: [CHUCKLES]
Hearing myself talk

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and trying to project what my
colleagues are hearing when

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:84%
they hear me talk,
it might sound

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:84%
a little kind of ethereal,
a little mystical.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And I do have a mystical
sense, but I'm really

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:90%
firmly rooted in science.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And there is nothing,
nothing about anything

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.600 align:middle line:84%
that we know about
science that disproves

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
the existence of something
greater out there.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- I use the word "God."

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Everyone else has a--

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:84%
can have a different
explanation, a different term.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
else that's out there.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.468 align:middle line:84%
There has to be,
because there's so much

00:06:32.468 --> 00:06:34.885 align:middle line:84%
that we don't understand, and
that we'll never understand.

program called "Sacred Powers."

>>CAROLINE MYSS: How we
understand the nature of God

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%

in the history of humanity.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Carolyn Myss, and we
can't talk about sacred power

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:10%
without talking about God.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:10%
Never before has
humanity experienced

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:10%
this level of disengagement
from religious traditions,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:10%
or the very question of
the existence of God.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:10%
Now think about that.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:10%
Think about that, the fact
that for the first time

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:10%
in the history of humanity,
a vast majority of people

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:10%
are questioning the
existence of God.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
For every choice,
there's a consequence.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:84%
What's the consequence
of a high percentage

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of people in a
society questioning

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:90%
the existence of God?

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not speaking to you
from the position of, let's say,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
fundamentalism, or Armageddon,
where I'm warning you

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:84%
that the fires of hell are
going to come raining down,

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
believe in any of that.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I'm talking pure,
mystical law, that there's

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:90%
a cause and there's effect.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:10%
There's action and
there's reaction,

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:10%
and that we live
in a universe where

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:10%
our thoughts and our
collective consciousness

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:10%
holds together the
world that we live in.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So when a high percentage
of the population

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.460 align:middle line:84%
begins to question
the nature of God,

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.970 align:middle line:84%
what happens to the
collective, the global,

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:84%
the different
pockets of society?

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Anger, division, and disdain
at traditional religion's

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:84%
inability to keep up with
the needs of a modern devotee

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:84%
has only encouraged people
to become very distant

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.775 align:middle line:84%
from religions that
they've been connected to.

00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's basically telling
us, Harley, as you've said,

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:90%
that there is a God.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: She is.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And she's also asking
a critical question

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to try to answer.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:90%
And that is, what happens--

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:84%
what are the consequences of
people, and increasing numbers

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of people, not believing in
a higher power, in something

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.630 align:middle line:90%
greater than ourselves?

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And the consequences are
in the newspaper every day.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.135 align:middle line:84%
In the newspaper every day,
we are confronted by evil--

00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:22.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Evil, constant.

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: --absolute evil.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:90%
And I mentioned it earlier.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
The consequence of not believing
in God is the Holocaust.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:84%
It is genocide around the
world after the Holocaust

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and before the Holocaust.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Its mass shootings.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
It is a disregard, a disrespect,
for our fellow humans.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't feel
as if we're answerable.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't feel as if there is
a consequence to our actions.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And that is ultimately
the consequence

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
of more and more people not
believing in something greater

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:90%
than ourselves.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.817 align:middle line:84%
We are not the be
all and the end all.

00:10:02.817 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
wondered about somebody

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.890 align:middle line:84%
who goes into a factory
or a work environment,

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
shoots it up, kills six
people, then kills themself.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Why do they do that?

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they just end their
own life first and get over

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:90%
with it?

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Right.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
combination of factors there.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm by no means
expert in mass shootings,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:84%
but I do spend a lot of my
time dealing with human nature.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think that people are
desperate for an impact.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And if they have no other
recourse to creating impact,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.900 align:middle line:84%
they choose an impact
that satisfies them,

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:90%
and then they're done.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Then they end their own lives.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
have to find--

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:84%
one of the keys of the
no regrets living concept

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:84%
is people have to seek
purpose in their lives.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And people who have
purpose in their lives

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.200 align:middle line:84%
don't go into factories
and shoot people.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: They don't
build gas chambers,

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.150 align:middle line:90%
and they don't commit suicide.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:90%
People who have purpose and--

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They love life.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: They love life.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:90%
They have meaning.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:90%
They have reason.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:90%
They have goals.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they love people.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: And they love people.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, I've always--

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:90%
you talk about the Holocaust.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Before Hitler And
the Nazis started

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:84%
doing what they were
doing, they were

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
welcomed by many US corporations
and bankers and individuals.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:84%
They thought this guy
was a great leader.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.010 align:middle line:90%
What the heck happened to him?

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:84%
How would-- how could
he go through that

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.542 align:middle line:84%
and change the way he
changed to become so evil?

00:11:47.542 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: I'm a
pediatrician at heart.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
evil originates

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:90%
in childhood, and that--

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happens.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.643 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: --something
happens in childhood.

00:11:59.643 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:90%
And there are exceptions.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:84%
There are horrible
exceptions of people

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:84%
raised in loving households
who end up doing evil things.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because maybe they're
born with some deficiency

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:84%
But I think, like you,
you're created to be evil.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: I think there
is a childhood opportunity

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:84%
to choose good or choose bad and
choose helpful or choose evil.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And that opportunity
is oftentimes

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
influenced by the household
that kids grow up in.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
If they grow up in
a loving family,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.340 align:middle line:84%
they don't turn
into Adolf Hitler.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've seen miracles
in your life, haven't you?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: I have.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.815 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give us an example.

00:12:40.815 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: Well, I'll
tell you the story of--

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:84%
there are medical
miracles, and then there

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.480 align:middle line:90%
are everyday miracles.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a medical miracle.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Alcides was, at the time,
a 37-year-old window washer

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.410 align:middle line:90%
in Manhattan.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:84%
He was washing windows on the
47th floor of a skyscraper,

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and the platform that
he was working on broke.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: And he
fell 47 stories.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ugh.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: He was taken to New
York Hospital, Cornell Medical

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Straight down.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Straight down.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Boom.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: Nothing in the
way, just hit the ground.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.290 align:middle line:84%
He was taken to New
York Hospital, where

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.340 align:middle line:84%
the surgeon in charge of the
trauma unit said, why are you

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:84%
bringing him here
this man is dead.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:84%
47 stories, you can't
possibly survive.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the same surgeon, the
same critical care specialist,

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:84%
had published a paper of a man
who survived a 19-story fall

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:84%
because that was the farthest
that anyone had ever fallen--

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And lived.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: --and still lived.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And lived.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: And still lived.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you
fall three stories,

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.553 align:middle line:84%
there's a 50% chance of death,
from three stories high,

00:13:46.553 --> 00:13:47.470 align:middle line:90%
a 50% chance of death.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's about, what,
30 feet, something like that?

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Exactly.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.380 align:middle line:90%
This man fell 47 stories.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
He's now driving his kids
to school in Arizona.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:90%
He's walking on charity walks.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And his surgeon said, if
you believe in miracles,

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:90%
this surely is one.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's on the
medical miracle side.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the 85 stories
in the "Miracles We Have Seen"

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:90%
book.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But let me ask your
viewers to look out

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:84%
the window that they're
closest to, whatever

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:90%
window they're close to.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to find something
in that window, in your view,

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:90%
that humans have created.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And I challenge you
to find anything

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.552 align:middle line:84%
that you see through your
window that humans have created.

00:14:34.552 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:84%
We haven't created the
tree that you're seeing.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:84%
We haven't created
the river that might

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:90%
be running near your house.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So you'll say, well, we created
the car that just drove by.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say, but with what?

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
What materials did you
use to create that car?

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Where did the steel come from?

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Iron.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.138 align:middle line:90%
Where did the iron come from?

00:14:53.138 --> 00:14:56.960 align:middle line:84%
What have we, as
humans, created?

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:10%
Miracles are everywhere
outside of our window.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:90%
A hummingbird is a miracle.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:84%
A hummingbird can flap its
wings 80 times per second,

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.380 align:middle line:90%
80 times per second.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It can fly 35 miles
an hour, and it

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:90%
can dive at 50 miles an hour.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Now can I make a hummingbird?

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I can't make a--

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I can't even understand
a hummingbird.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:90%
A hummingbird is a miracle.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say something now
that's heretical, George.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:90%
I believe viruses are miracles.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And why are viruses miracles?

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I've studied viruses in
the lab now for 40 years.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:90%
I can't make a virus.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
But a virus can infect a
cell, and within a matter

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:84%
of a few hours, create
1 million progeny

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:84%
virus, 1 million other
viruses within a cell

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:84%
until the cell gives
up and explodes,

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and those viruses spread to
all the neighboring cells.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
are so desperately

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.390 align:middle line:84%
ill when we get certain
virus infections like COVID,

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:10%
Viruses are miraculous.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:90%
I can't make a virus.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll never be-- and even if
someday I can make a virus,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I would ask, what is
the miracle that gave me

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
the ingenuity, the
creativity, and the brainpower

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:90%
to be able to create a virus?

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I haven't done it yet.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.465 align:middle line:84%
But if I can someday, that
too will be a miracle.

00:16:18.465 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: James Van
Praagh, the medium,

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:84%
talked about miracles
being commonplace.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.073 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:16:26.073 --> 00:16:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
I really think

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that people have to
understand miracles more.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think if they did, they
would realize that miracles

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:90%
are part of our everyday life.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And we can have
miracles in our life

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.290 align:middle line:84%
if we just work
with that energy,

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and we come to
that awareness, we

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:84%
come to that sense
of mindfulness.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So how many people here
in the studio audience

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:84%
have experienced miracles
in some way or another?

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:90%
You have.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:90%
You have.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.770 align:middle line:90%
We all have.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:90%
But do we acknowledge them?

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.958 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you acknowledge them
because we all have to-- it'll

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.540 align:middle line:90%
be right there in front of us.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.207 align:middle line:84%
We know this is a
miracle this happened.

00:16:59.207 --> 00:17:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think miracles can
happen in little ways.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I think in subtle ways
they happen as well.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I think what a
miracle is is really

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.630 align:middle line:90%
confirmation of the divine.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I really believe it's
confirmation of the divine.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think a miracle
happens every single day

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
within the body, where the cells
change, and die off, and grow,

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:90%
and reproduce.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:84%
And I think as we
look around us,

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and every day we
experience a brand new day,

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a miracle.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just God
showing God's self.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we are
all that God energy.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
could have miracles,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and miracles are a part
of our everyday existence,

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:84%
as long as we take the time to
be mindful about who we are.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.443 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You agree with him?

00:17:39.443 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Absolutely.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
as a physician, I

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:84%
am more acutely aware of the
miracles of the human body

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.390 align:middle line:84%
that he alluded to,
perhaps, than other people.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'm also a patient.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:84%
I had quadruple bypass
surgery six years ago

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:90%
for heart disease.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And I-- other than the
scar running down my chest,

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:07.930 align:middle line:84%
somehow, my body managed
to heal from that.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a miracle.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a miracle that
when I get the tiniest paper

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
cut, the tiniest
paper cut, my body

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:84%
mobilizes first responders
to come to that paper cut

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:90%
and heal it--

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.940 align:middle line:84%
miraculous,
absolutely miraculous.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And we are living miracles,
and it's our opportunity

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:84%
to look out the window,
as I was saying before,

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:37.752 align:middle line:84%
and recognize the miracles
that are outside of us as well.

00:18:37.752 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is amazing.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:84%
The body is just an
incredible machine

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:84%
that fixes itself, takes care of
itself, if you take care of it.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: That's right.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the concepts
of no regrets living

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:90%
is the responsibility to heal.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
healing ourselves.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:84%
That includes taking care of
our bodies, as you just said.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And then our bodies
take care of us.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Not always.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
We still have not gotten
to the point where we

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:90%
can overcome all the diseases.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:84%
My dad died of
pancreatic cancer.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:90%
That was 40 years ago.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:90%
To this day, pancreatic cancer--

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's the worst.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: --it's
still the worst.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.542 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is the worst.

00:19:15.542 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: And we
haven't gotten there yet.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been able
to heal and cure.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.640 align:middle line:84%
But the legacy of
medicine and the ingenuity

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
that we have been imbued
with is that someday we will.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Someday we will cure
pancreatic cancer.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.695 align:middle line:90%
I'm confident of that.

00:19:31.695 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was at a restaurant
with my producer Tom

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Danheiser several
years ago, and we

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:84%
ran into Patrick Swayze,
the late actor who

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:90%
died of pancreatic cancer.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Tom,
go up and get him.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's get him for the show.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And so Tom went up
there, was very polite,

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and Swayze was
very, very cordial.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't want you
coming up to their table,

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and I understand that.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.540 align:middle line:84%
But Swayze said, sit down,
let's talk for a little bit.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
little discussion.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know, and I'm not
sure Swayze knew at the time,

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:90%
that he had pancreatic cancer.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:84%
But he died a couple
of years later.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Once you get it, you
can't fight it, can you?

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: Well, the
survival during my dad's era,

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:21.010 align:middle line:84%
40 years ago, was about a
year, once after diagnosis.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:90%
My dad lived 13 months.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And now the survival
is a little bit better,

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.820 align:middle line:84%
perhaps as long as
two years, on average.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:84%
But compared to the
progress that we've

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
made with other cancers,
it's still dismal.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But every time we have faced
as a society apparently

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:46.340 align:middle line:84%
incurable diseases, apparently
unstoppable pandemics, when

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:84%
we have been faced with
horrific natural disasters,

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
terrible man-made accidents, our
trajectory as humans is upward.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, we have managed to
overcome so many of those

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:90%
that I am optimistic.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm optimistic.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are very optimistic
of humanity, aren't you?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: I am, and I'll
tell you this perverse basis

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.800 align:middle line:90%
for some of that.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.050 align:middle line:84%
You can't be optimistic
reading the newspaper.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.307 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:21:19.307 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And nobody even reads
the newspaper anymore.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.973 align:middle line:84%
You can't be optimistic
reading the news

00:21:22.973 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:90%
or hearing the news anymore.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are there newspapers?

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Not for long.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:10%
My family is-- my
wife, my kids--

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:10%
are addicted to the "Game
of Thrones" TV show.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:36.620 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand it.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A lot of people are.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: A lot of people are.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.548 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I haven't
even watched it.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: Right, well, I
walk by the TV when it's on,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and I am horrified by
the brief interlude

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.530 align:middle line:84%
that I have with what's
going on on the screen.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And I can't imagine
what they see in it.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But historians tell us that
the reality of medieval history

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
is not that far different
from what's being portrayed

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.490 align:middle line:90%
on the "Game of Thrones."

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:90%
That is--

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: --mankind,
humankind, humanity

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
was in an awful place not
that long ago, centuries,

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:84%
but within the scope
of human existence.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at
our civilization today

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and the improvement--

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we stop
at stoplights now.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.270 align:middle line:84%
We stand in lines
waiting for things.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:84%
We don't routinely
stab ourselves,

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
stab the people who are
standing in front of us

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:90%
in order to get ahead in line.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.717 align:middle line:90%
That's "Game of Thrones"--

00:22:36.717 --> 00:22:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Most of us don't.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Most of us.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:84%
You're right, we've
talked about some

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:90%
of the evil that still exists.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But in general, humanity
is on an upward trajectory.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And you have to look
at the big picture.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at the
entirety of human history

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:90%
to appreciate it.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But in general, we are
on an upward trajectory.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you mean
by "no regrets living"?

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: When I was a medical
student in the late 1970s,

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I took care of a
50-year-old man.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And "take care of" is the
wrong way to express it.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:15.392 align:middle line:84%
Medical students don't do
much providing of care,

00:23:15.392 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:84%
so we have a chance to do a
lot of talking to our patients.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.212 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, observation.

00:23:19.212 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Observation.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So I spent a lot of time talking
to this 50-year-old man who

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:84%
had been diagnosed with
a terminal disease,

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:90%
and had only months to live.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And the entire conversation
was about his regrets,

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
was about what he had not yet
had a chance to accomplish

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.870 align:middle line:84%
in his life, who
he had not yet had

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:84%
a chance to express
his love to, places

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:90%
that he had not yet traveled--

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People to apologize to.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: --people
to apologize to.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:48.210 align:middle line:84%
It was a recognition
that he can't do it over,

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:84%
that the time was done,
and he had great regrets.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And from that day
on, I began trying

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle line:84%
to live my life
with fewer regrets.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, the culmination
of those seven keys

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about at
the beginning to achieving

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:84%
no regrets, or at
least fewer regrets.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
No regrets may be a
little bit of a hyperbole.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:90%
We all have some regrets.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.450 align:middle line:84%
But we can get
past most of them,

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.717 align:middle line:84%
and we can prevent most
of the future ones,

00:24:20.717 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know the old
saying, "woulda, coulda,

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:90%
shoulda."

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.792 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: "Woulda,
coulda, shoulda."

00:24:24.792 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's a
phrase that I used to use,

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:32.040 align:middle line:84%
of all things said of tongue
and pen, the saddest of which,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.060 align:middle line:90%
"what might have been."

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: What might have been,
that's exactly right, George.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.567 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
to move forward.

00:24:36.567 --> 00:24:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: You have to move
forward, and the way to do that

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:43.840 align:middle line:90%
is in key number six.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is, to seek
self forgiveness.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:52.970 align:middle line:84%
When we think about woulda,
coulda, shoulda in the past,

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
what we wish would
have been, we have

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that there was
a context, that the decisions

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.270 align:middle line:84%
that we made, the
actions that we took,

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:84%
all occurred within the
context of that day.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
We are now living
with the outcome.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
remember that we made

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:90%
the decisions in that context.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And in that context, we may
have made the wrong decision.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But it was a decision
that we made,

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and now we have to
learn from that.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:90%
We have to move beyond that.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do
everything we can

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.670 align:middle line:84%
to prevent the kind of regret
that we had in the past

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:90%
from recurring.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I used
to beat myself up

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
years ago for decisions I
made that didn't turn out

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:90%
the right way.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.320 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I
realized, wait a minute.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.590 align:middle line:90%
I just learned from this.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:44.872 align:middle line:84%
This is an experience that
has helped me, not hurt me.

00:25:44.872 --> 00:25:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
I live these days,

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's made a tremendous
difference in my life.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.893 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: I have to predict
that it's eliminated some

00:25:52.893 --> 00:25:55.185 align:middle line:84%
of those woulda, coulda,
shouldas, those regrets that--

00:25:55.185 --> 00:25:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
say that anymore.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Exactly.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And that really is the key.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.660 align:middle line:84%
The self-forgiveness
key of no regrets living

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:84%
is that we have to
begin to acknowledge

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.180 align:middle line:90%
that we're not perfect.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
We are human, and that
by acknowledging that,

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:15.750 align:middle line:84%
there are going to
have been mistakes.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
There may be mistakes
in the future,

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:84%
but we've learned how
to cope with them.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:22.005 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jack Canfield, of
course, "Chicken Soup"--

00:26:22.005 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Of course.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --was on Gaia's
Masterclass program

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.232 align:middle line:84%
talking about finding
one's purpose in life.

00:26:28.232 --> 00:26:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>JACK CANFIELD:
Soren Kierkegaard,

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:31.680 align:middle line:84%
who was a Danish
philosopher, a theologian,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and psychologist said,
"God has given each of us

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:90%
our 'marching orders.'

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Our purpose here on Earth
is to find those orders

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:90%
and carry them out.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Those orders acknowledge our
special gifts and talents."

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And so each of us
has marching orders.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know what they
are because they're

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:90%
encoded in you as your talents.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.598 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
doing that talent,

00:26:48.598 --> 00:26:51.140 align:middle line:84%
you're feeling the joy we talked
about earlier, so again, joy

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.400 align:middle line:90%
being our guidance system.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Ralph Waldo Emerson, who
was an American philosopher

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and a poet, said, "Each
man has his own vocation.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.900 align:middle line:90%
The talent is the call.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
There is one direction in which
all space is open to him."

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.820 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing what you're
supposed to do, doors open.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:84%
If you'll push through that
first level of resistance,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.807 align:middle line:90%
you open up.

00:27:11.807 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Then things start to soar.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you've
ever been in a plane,

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and you think you're
never going to take off.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, you
do and it's working really hard.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.720 align:middle line:84%
But once you get up to
35,000 feet, it coasts,

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:90%
uses a lot less fuel.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And you get-- you're coasting
along up in the jet stream,

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:25.410 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.785 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
our life is like.

00:27:26.785 --> 00:27:29.095 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing to do
that thing which is easy.

00:27:29.095 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
get some rejection

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:84%
to test if we're
really committed.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.838 align:middle line:84%
But if you stay passionate
and committed to it,

00:27:33.838 --> 00:27:37.085 align:middle line:84%
then what starts to happen is
you get to coast a little bit.

00:27:37.085 --> 00:27:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spot on, no?

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Spot on.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And that really--
seeking purpose

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:84%
is the other part
of key number six.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to
Kierkegaard and Emerson,

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll quote Viktor
Frankl, who was

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:84%
the psychologist and
the founder of what's

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:90%
now called logotherapy.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a
seminal book called

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.640 align:middle line:90%
"Man's Search for Meaning."

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And in that book, he said
that once we have purpose

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.690 align:middle line:90%
in our lives, we live longer.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, scientists have
subsequently proven that.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: They've looked
at the impact of purpose,

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.990 align:middle line:84%
the impact of having
meaning, and they

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:84%
find that not only
do we live longer.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We live healthier, and we
can even defeat cancer.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.160 align:middle line:84%
We're less lonely, and
we're less prone to suicide.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And all of that
is because we have

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:90%
found purpose in our lives.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And we are the only species on
Earth that has to seek purpose.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Other species are
instinctively purposeful.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.810 align:middle line:84%
They procreate, they
protect their young,

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.118 align:middle line:90%
and then they do it again.

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
protect themselves.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.285 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: And they
protect themselves.

00:28:43.285 --> 00:28:44.660 align:middle line:90%
But we have to go beyond that.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Humans are empowered to find
a purpose beyond instinct.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, when we
recognize our purpose in life,

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.800 align:middle line:84%
we actually can act more
instinctively toward it

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:84%
because we know the
direction that we're headed.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no question
about having purpose, having

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:84%
direction in your life,
and moving forward.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: That's right.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it leads to
no regrets because if we

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.470 align:middle line:84%
know where we're going, even
if we haven't been there yet,

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.360 align:middle line:84%
even if we have those woulda,
coulda, shouldas in our life,

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:84%
but we know where
we're going now,

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.320 align:middle line:84%
we are less regretful
of what we haven't yet

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.240 align:middle line:84%
accomplished because we know
what we have to yet accomplish.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
look at all of this

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:84%
and put it together with a
person in his life or her life,

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.320 align:middle line:90%
it's a dramatic change.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:84%
It makes them like life a
little bit better, doesn't it?

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: Yeah, [CHUCKLES]
it's the subtitle of the book.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is, "Keys to a Life
of Wonder and Contentment."

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
If I look out the
window and recognize

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:84%
the power of something
greater than me,

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.250 align:middle line:84%
the responsibility that I
have toward that greater

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:84%
context, the potential for
reward and punishment-- and I'm

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.480 align:middle line:84%
not even talking about
reward or punishment

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.340 align:middle line:90%
that may come down from above.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the sense of reward

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and the sense of
punishment that we

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.330 align:middle line:84%
have when we do something
that we know is good

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and we do something
that we know is bad,

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that immediate sense of
reward for doing kindness,

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:84%
that immediate sense of
punishment for being cruel.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:90%
We recognize that.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we can establish for
ourselves reward and punishment

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:42.540 align:middle line:84%
as a truism, that we are
truly rewarded and punished

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:84%
by every action that we have,
we will have fewer opportunities

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.240 align:middle line:84%
to regret because we
will be choosing reward

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.950 align:middle line:90%
instead of choosing punishment.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there an
episode that helped

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.590 align:middle line:84%
shape your no regrets
philosophy in life?

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: Well,
there have been many,

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:10.260 align:middle line:84%
but I have always regretted
not taking the opportunity

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:15.810 align:middle line:84%
to travel to a destitute part of
the world to practice medicine.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.948 align:middle line:90%
Many of my colleagues did.

00:31:17.948 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A troubled area?

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.115 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: A troubled area.

00:31:20.115 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:84%
They went with Doctors
Without Borders.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.780 align:middle line:84%
They went to hurricane-ravaged
or earthquake-ravaged parts

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.580 align:middle line:84%
They would spend 30 days
helping to construct a clinic

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.270 align:middle line:90%
to help eradicate malaria.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.710 align:middle line:90%
My colleagues did this.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I spent my career in
the intensive care

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.550 align:middle line:84%
unit taking care of the
sickest kids in Colorado.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have the courage to
do what my colleagues had done,

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and that is to leave
my comfort zone.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:90%
And I regretted that.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I came
to terms with it,

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and I did what I
mentioned before.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.870 align:middle line:90%
I recognized the context.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.930 align:middle line:84%
The stage of my career, the
work that I was doing here

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:84%
that I felt was
important, the family

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that I would be leaving
behind with young kids

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:10.170 align:middle line:84%
to go abroad to do,
obviously, to do good.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.770 align:middle line:84%
But when I recognized
that context,

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.490 align:middle line:84%
I realized that regrets
can be overcome.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Past regrets can be overcome
by acknowledging the situation

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're in, and by
comforting ourselves

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:28.560 align:middle line:84%
by the alternative good
that we are trying to do.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, look at the good
that you did for the people

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.785 align:middle line:84%
that you helped in these ER
rooms, and places like that.

00:32:34.785 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: That was what
I ultimately told myself.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was worried
that as a specialist,

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.950 align:middle line:84%
as an infectious
diseases doctor,

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't have the
general pediatric skills

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.160 align:middle line:84%
that my colleagues who went with
Doctors Without Borders had,

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.950 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't know what
to do with the routine stuff

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:55.620 align:middle line:84%
anymore because I was taking
care of such sick kids.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.720 align:middle line:84%
But then I told
myself, but you're

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:90%
taking care of such sick kids.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Somebody needs to do that,
not just go to Haiti.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned to
live with that regret.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about evil?

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:12.456 align:middle line:84%
Where does evil fit
in on some of this?

00:33:12.456 --> 00:33:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: The third key of
no regrets living is to heal.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And as a physician,
that's paramount for me--

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.900 align:middle line:84%
healing ourselves,
healing our patients,

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.540 align:middle line:90%
healing our friends and family.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think we also need to heal
society, and to heal the world.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And each of us has
a part in that.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest
need for healing

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.160 align:middle line:90%
is the need to heal evil.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.275 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to believe
that we can do that.

00:33:39.275 --> 00:33:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's a
lot of evil out there.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.942 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: There's a
lot of evil out there.

00:33:42.942 --> 00:33:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's those
horrible news stories

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.987 align:middle line:84%
that we talked
about a moment ago.

00:33:45.987 --> 00:33:49.610 align:middle line:84%
How can we possibly believe
that we can heal evil,

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:53.270 align:middle line:84%
that we can prevent the
Genghis Khans, the Adolf

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Hitlers, the Joseph Stalins?

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:58.460 align:middle line:84%
How can we prevent the
shooter in the skyscraper

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.830 align:middle line:84%
in Las Vegas who fires
down indiscriminately

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:90%
onto a concert?

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.910 align:middle line:84%
How can we heal
that kind of evil?

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you an example
of how I think we can do that.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.510 align:middle line:84%
The example comes from
Whitwell, Tennessee.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a rural population
of 2,000 people.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And in 1998, they were teaching
their middle school kids

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.540 align:middle line:90%
about the Holocaust.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And the kids learned that some
Norwegians would clip a paper

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.870 align:middle line:84%
clip to their lapel as a silent
protest against the Nazis.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.239 align:middle line:84%
And so these kids
thought, what if we

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.840 align:middle line:84%
collected paper clips
in commemoration

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.100 align:middle line:90%
of those who were killed?

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And they set out to collect
6 million paper clips

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.940 align:middle line:84%
for the 6 million
Jews who were killed,

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately 11 million
paper clips for the gays,

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:52.610 align:middle line:84%
the Gypsies, the disabled, who
were also killed by Hitler.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.429 align:middle line:84%
They received paper clips
from George W. Bush,

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.515 align:middle line:84%
from Bill Clinton, from
celebrities across the country,

00:34:58.515 --> 00:34:59.390 align:middle line:90%
and across the world.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:04.790 align:middle line:84%
They collected 30 million paper
clips in Whitwell, Tennessee

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:84%
because fifth grade students
learned about the Holocaust.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:84%
People donated artifacts
from World War II,

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:84%
including an
authentic railroad car

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.300 align:middle line:84%
that had been used
to transport victims

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.450 align:middle line:84%
to concentration camps, which
is now a museum in Whitwell,

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Tennessee.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ha!

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.200 align:middle line:90%
That's fantastic.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: The key thing
about Whitwell, Tennessee

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.490 align:middle line:84%
is that as far as anyone
knows, there was never

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:90%
a Jewish family living there.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.590 align:middle line:84%
There was never a gay
family living there.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.420 align:middle line:84%
This was a community that
learned from its children.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:84%
The adults learned
from the children.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And that, from child to
adult, is how we prevent evil.

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The human mind
does a lot of things.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.160 align:middle line:84%
On a TED Talk, Charles
Bennett talks a lot

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.940 align:middle line:84%
about being prepared with
scientific breakthroughs

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.440 align:middle line:90%
of a prepared mind.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.050 align:middle line:10%
>> CHARLES BENNETT:
The prepared mind,

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:02.500 align:middle line:10%
Louis Pasteur talked
about the prepared mind.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.050 align:middle line:10%
It's the key to
scientific discovery.

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:08.860 align:middle line:10%
A prepared mind also has
chance, as you mentioned.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:14.320 align:middle line:10%
The prepared mind is a person
or a thinker who's out there,

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.890 align:middle line:10%
has contact, and also takes
the opportunity, as Louis

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:22.962 align:middle line:10%
Pasteur said, and with that, can
make some terrific discoveries

00:36:22.962 --> 00:36:26.550 align:middle line:10%
>>ROTBART: Louis Pasteur
is one of my heroes.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a hero of every
infectious disease doctor

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:84%
because Louis Pasteur was
the grandfather of all germ

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:84%
treatment, of the germ
theory, pasteurization.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.090 align:middle line:84%
The term "pasteurization,"
comes from Louis Pasteur.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.260 align:middle line:90%
He's a personal hero.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.760 align:middle line:90%
He's a hero of many of us.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But the one concept that has
stuck with so many people who

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.430 align:middle line:84%
are not infectious
disease doctors

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:52.180 align:middle line:84%
is that chance favors
the prepared mind.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Discovery favors
the prepared mind.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:37:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And that, ultimately, is the
true evidence of something

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:01.920 align:middle line:90%
greater than us.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.130 align:middle line:84%
We have been-- as
far as we know,

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:08.370 align:middle line:84%
other species have not
been as well imbued

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:14.670 align:middle line:84%
with the capacity of our
brain to overcome the greatest

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:90%
challenges of the world.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, huge.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Huge.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And our prepared minds
have cured many cancers,

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:26.160 align:middle line:84%
have cured many
incurable diseases.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Our prepared minds have
made airplane travel safer,

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:31.650 align:middle line:90%
automobile travel safer.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.770 align:middle line:84%
There was a 7.5
magnitude earthquake

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:38.570 align:middle line:84%
in Alaska a couple of years
ago, and there was essentially

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.370 align:middle line:90%
no damage.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:40.440 align:middle line:90%
There were no lives lost.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Because our prepared
minds now know

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:46.000 align:middle line:84%
how to build
earthquake-proof structures.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: There.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.673 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There, yeah.

00:37:48.673 --> 00:37:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: Sadly, not
everywhere in the world.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:54.360 align:middle line:84%
But the prepared minds are
capable of expanding that

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.890 align:middle line:90%
to everywhere in the world.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.530 align:middle line:84%
We now have hurricane
warning systems.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:90%
We have tornado warning systems.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.330 align:middle line:90%
We have safer cars.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Our prepared minds
have advanced society

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.760 align:middle line:84%
so dramatically
that I do believe

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.000 align:middle line:90%
that those prepared minds--

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.610 align:middle line:84%
as the example in
Whitwell, Tennessee--

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.670 align:middle line:84%
are going to teach
us how to cure,

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.845 align:middle line:90%
how to heal the world from evil.

00:38:19.845 --> 00:38:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Rotbart, we
started talking about miracles

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:84%
on this program, the person
who fell 47 stories and lived,

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Who creates the miracles?

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Is it us?

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Or are we tapping
into something?

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: Well, the first key
to no regrets living is belief.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the answer
to your question, George,

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:48.450 align:middle line:84%
is that miracles
are not accidental.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And miracles can be
man-made, but they're

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:56.940 align:middle line:84%
manmade because humans have
been given the capacity

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.400 align:middle line:84%
to create them
because we have been

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.640 align:middle line:84%
given the capacity by something
greater than ourselves.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Miracles come from
outside of us,

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:11.400 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes using us as a
vehicle for transmitting it.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.350 align:middle line:84%
There is something called the
law of sensitive dependence

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:21.555 align:middle line:84%
on initial conditions, better
known as the butterfly effect.

00:39:21.555 --> 00:39:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And the butterfly effect says
that the flap of a butterfly's

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.820 align:middle line:84%
wings in one part of the
world, with infinite subsequent

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:34.020 align:middle line:84%
events, can lead to a
tsunami across the world

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:39.060 align:middle line:84%
because those infinite
inflection points along the way

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.400 align:middle line:84%
can build and can
change something.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Nowhere better is that seen than
what happened in Wuhan, China,

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.880 align:middle line:84%
where an event in
one part of the world

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.517 align:middle line:84%
spread to literally shut
down the entire world.

00:39:51.517 --> 00:39:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The planet.

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:53.267 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: The planet.

00:39:53.267 --> 00:39:55.530 align:middle line:84%
That was the butterfly
effect, the law

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.760 align:middle line:84%
of sensitive dependence on
initial conditions, in extreme.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:05.250 align:middle line:84%
The capacity for miracles, the
capacity to create miracles

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:09.090 align:middle line:84%
exists within every one of
us when we flap our wings.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:11.100 align:middle line:84%
When we flap our
butterfly wings,

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:16.690 align:middle line:84%
we have the capacity to spread
that effect across the world.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't know who's going to
be affected by what we do.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But people are going to
be affected by what we do.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.945 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we can
create the miracles.

00:40:24.945 --> 00:40:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we ever have a
planet of love and happiness,

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:32.860 align:middle line:84%
where people take care
of people, instead

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:36.025 align:middle line:90%
of wars and famines?

00:40:36.025 --> 00:40:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ROTBART: Well,
again, you asked

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.380 align:middle line:84%
before if I'm an
optimist or a pessimist,

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.880 align:middle line:90%
and I am an optimist.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I think we are better
now than we were

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:90%
during the "Game of Thrones."

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I think we are more loving and
more kind and more thoughtful

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:52.137 align:middle line:84%
now than we were
during the Holocaust.

00:40:52.137 --> 00:40:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Most of us.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:54.635 align:middle line:90%
>>ROTBART: Most of us.

00:40:54.635 --> 00:40:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Are we ever going
to all be that way?

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:57.410 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm also a student
of human nature,

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and I recognize that there
is that evil on one shoulder,

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.290 align:middle line:84%
whereas good as on
the other shoulder.

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have to figure out a
way to defeat the bad shoulder.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So I wish I could say the
answer to that is obviously yes.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.230 align:middle line:84%
But I'll put an
asterisk on it, and I'll

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:21.140 align:middle line:84%
say, yes, I think we will
ultimately get to that world

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.910 align:middle line:84%
if we don't destroy
ourselves first.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were talking to
a group of kids, 10 years old,

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:29.090 align:middle line:84%
who just wanted to know
about their future,

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.595 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell them?

00:41:30.595 --> 00:41:33.260 align:middle line:10%
>>ROTBART: Well, I have the
opportunity as a pediatrician

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.580 align:middle line:10%
to do that a lot.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.860 align:middle line:10%
And I tell them
that each of them,

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.900 align:middle line:10%
each of the children
in that room,

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:45.530 align:middle line:10%
has the chance to be a
factor for good in the world,

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:53.480 align:middle line:10%
to be a creator of miracles,
and that each of those kids, we

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.750 align:middle line:10%
depend upon each of those kids
to make our world a better

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.020 align:middle line:10%
place.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:90%
We've had failures.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.580 align:middle line:84%
My parents' generation
had even more failures.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Our grandparents' generation
had even more failures.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.340 align:middle line:84%
We are getting
better, but we depend

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.815 align:middle line:84%
upon the future generations
to carry that forth.
