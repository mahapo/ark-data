>>GEORGE NOORY: We need to
give people the information.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.300 align:middle line:10%
>> now the host of the
nationally syndicated "Coast

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.140 align:middle line:10%
to Coast AM" and Gaiam TV
bring you "Beyond Belief"

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.852 align:middle line:10%
with George Noory.

00:00:30.852 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.102 align:middle line:10%
it's great to have
you with us today.

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, normally, I
don't walk around

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:10%
with a bag of
cornflakes with me,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:10%
but tonight's program is
very special and unusual.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:10%
This is genetically
modified, which

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:10%
means that it's been altered.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:10%
It's been changed.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.037 align:middle line:10%
To me, is it real food?

00:00:51.037 --> 00:00:52.870 align:middle line:10%
In a moment you're going
to hear from a very

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:10%
special guest of mine as
we talk about genetically

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:10%
modified foods.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to introduce you to
our very special guest Jeffrey

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.290 align:middle line:10%
Smith.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:10%
Jeffrey is an
expert in GMO foods.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.480 align:middle line:10%
Let's welcome Jeffrey Smith.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.929 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:09.895 align:middle line:10%


00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:11.344 align:middle line:10%
It's good to see you.

00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:10%
Oh, by the way, Jeff, don't
say I never bought you lunch.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:10%
>>JEFFREY SMITH: Thank you.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.765 align:middle line:10%
I'll just leave it here for now.

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How are you?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Doing great.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's new with you?

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.868 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, I just
spent a lot of time

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:28.183 align:middle line:10%
in California trying to get Prop
37 past for labeling of GMOs.

00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did not work.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Did not work.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:10%
There was a big disinformation
campaign, a million a day.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:10%
So people bought into
that story and said

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:10%
we don't want GMOs labeled
because it'll do this, this,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:10%
and this, and this.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.765 align:middle line:10%
All of that was a lie.

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What normal
person would not

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:10%
vote for something that would
say this food has been labeled

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:10%
with it or without?

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:10%
Why did it go down in defeat?

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: It wasn't a
referendum on whether GMOs

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:10%
should be labeled.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:10%
Because 9 out of 10
Americans and Californians

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:10%
still want that.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:10%
But the other side twisted it
and said if you pass Prop 37,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:10%
it's going to raise your
grocery bill by $400.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:10%
That's not true.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:10%
61 countries have
labeling, didn't go up.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:10%
It's going to create lawsuits.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be
bad for farmers,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:10%
bad for small businesses.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:10%
It's a poorly
written proposition

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:10%
that has exemptions
by special interests.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:10%
All that was concocted
by the public relations

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:10%
firms in the biotech
industry's back room

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.452 align:middle line:10%
to say how can we
convince people

00:02:24.452 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:10%
to vote against their
best self-interest.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they
were very successful.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Very successful, yes.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:10%
When you were a little boy,
you didn't grow up saying,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:10%
you know what, I'm going to deal
with genetically modified foods

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:10%
when I grow up.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:10%
How in the heck did
this happen for you?

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.577 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, I
went to a lecture

00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:10%
by a molecular biologist who
was an expert genetic engineer.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.210 align:middle line:10%
In 1996, he was
appalled that they

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:10%
were about to release the
products of this infant science

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:10%
to the entire population and
put it in the environment where

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:10%
there was no way to recall
the self-propagating genetic

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:10%
pollution, because the
pollen will just transfer.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:10%
He knew from a technical basis
why the technology was not

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:10%
ready for prime time.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:10%
He knew it would cause
unpredicted side effects.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.610 align:middle line:10%
It could hurt people.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:10%
And when I heard his
information, which

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:10%
was presented very
technically, I

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:10%
said people need
to hear about this.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:10%
And I realized I was
talking to myself.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:10%
So I started interviewing
him and other scientists

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:10%
and translating the
science into English

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:10%
so that other people could
understand what was going on.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I swear, when I
was in a store years ago

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:10%
and bought some
tomatoes, they must

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:10%
have been genetically modified.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:10%
They tasted like cardboard.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, there was
genetically modified tomatoes

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:10%
in '94, '95, and '96.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't taste too
good, so they actually

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:10%
were taken off the market.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:10%
There's no more genetically
modified tomatoes

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:10%
because of market rejection.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:10%
Same thing with the potatoes.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:10%
But there's still nine
genetically modified food crops

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:10%
out there.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:10%
And because soy and corn
are genetically engineered,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:10%
and sugar from
sugar beets, they're

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:10%
in most processed foods.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, this
is just an example

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:90%
of some GMO-type foods, right?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:90%
How do they make this stuff?

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: All right.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.820 align:middle line:10%
So this corn is
genetically engineered

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:10%
with corn that produces
its own toxic insecticide.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:10%
It produces a protein that
breaks open holes in the cell

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:10%
walls of insects to kill them.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:10%
Now the biotech industry
swore up and down

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:10%
this will never happen
to humans or mammals.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:10%
But in 2012, in
February, a study

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:10%
was released showing it does
poke holes in human cells.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And in 2011, another
one of their assumptions--

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:10%
which was, oh, don't
worry, the BT toxin,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:10%
which is what it's called--

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.490 align:middle line:10%
is destroyed in human digestion.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Well it was found in the
blood of 93% of pregnant women

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and in 80% of their
unborn fetuses.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.307 align:middle line:10%
If we eat this corn
chip and the BTG--

00:04:36.307 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I dare you to eat that.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: No way.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.463 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: No, you won't it.

00:04:39.463 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: This is
non-food for me, George.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:10%
If the gene that
produces the BT toxin

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:10%
transfers into the DNA
of our gut bacteria

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:10%
and continues to
function, it means

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:10%
it converts our intestinal
flora into living pesticide

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:10%
factories.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's why 93%
of pregnant women in Canada

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:10%
had the BT toxin in
their blood, because it

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:10%
was being produced continuously
inside our digestive tract.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:10%
When I say this to doctors
at medical conferences,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:10%
they say this might
explain the increase

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:10%
in gastrointestinal
disorders we're

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:10%
seeing on the rise in the US.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:10%
I have interviewed doctors
who prescribe non-GMO diets

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:10%
to all their patients.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.260 align:middle line:10%
And there are thousands of
doctors that do just that.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:10%
We also solicit case
studies from people.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:10%
So I've talked to
hundreds of people

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:10%
who say that they're
getting better

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:10%
from a variety of
symptoms, sometimes

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:10%
eliminate those
symptoms altogether.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:10%
Someone in a doctor's
office told me 25 days

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:10%
into a non-GMO diet, third
day, no more Crohn's disease

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:10%
after 30 years.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:10%
Lost 10 pounds and the skin
condition started clearing up.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.580 align:middle line:10%
We have immune system problems,
reproductive problems,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:10%
and gastrointestinal
problems that

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:10%
tend to clear up very quickly.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's your definition,
Jeffrey, of organic food?

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, organic is very
clearly defined by the USDA.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that's most important to me

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not allowed to
intentionally use genetically

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:90%
engineered ingredients.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:10%
So when I want to avoid
GMOs, I'll look at a product

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:10%
and see does it have
the organic seal

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.400 align:middle line:10%
or does it say made with organic
ingredients on the front.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:10%
And then I know that
if there is GMOs,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:10%
it's a very tiny amount
of contamination.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are the companies
responsible for GMO

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.330 align:middle line:10%
foods trying to get
labeling for organic foods

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.438 align:middle line:10%
where they can sell
GMO foods as organic?

00:06:25.438 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:10%
Are they trying for that?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: They tried
for that years ago.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:10%
And over 300,000 people
protested saying hands off

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:10%
of our organic food.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:10%
So I don't see them
giving up that strength.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:10%
Organic means non-GMO.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:10%
That's pretty solid.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's go
back a long time ago.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:10%
How did they conceive this?

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:10%
And what was the reason why?

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: There's a company that
sells an herbicide, the most

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:10%
popular herbicide in the world.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.360 align:middle line:10%
And their patent was
expiring in 2000.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:10%
And so they wanted Roundup
Herbicide to continue to sell.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.578 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And so they
created a Roundup Ready Seed

00:07:05.578 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:10%
where you sold the
seed and you could

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:10%
spray the whole field
with Roundup Herbicide

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:10%
and not kill the
particular crop.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:10%
And they said if
you buy our seed,

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:10%
and you have to
buy our herbicide.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.045 align:middle line:10%
So it extended the dominance
of that herbicide after--

00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In terms of business,
was that a smart approach?

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:10%
Probably.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.080 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Genius.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: I mean it made
them billions of dollars.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.547 align:middle line:10%
They could sell
the seeds and then

00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:10%
they dominated the seed
market, raised the prices.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:10%
And it made weeding
easier for farmers

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:10%
because they could just
spray the field with Roundup

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:10%
and kill all of the other
plant biodiversity, but not

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.580 align:middle line:10%
the Roundup Ready crops.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:10%
Now Roundup, it turns
out, is very dangerous.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.140 align:middle line:10%
They fed rats a tiny amount of
Roundup in the drinking water,

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:10%
less than what is considered
maximum in the United States.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:10%
And they gave it for
their entire lives.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:10%
Huge, multiple massive
tumors as much as 25%

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.560 align:middle line:10%
of their body weight.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:10%
They died at two or
three times the rate.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:10%
And they had organ damage.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Isn't
this kind of scary?

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, you know, I
deal with this all the time

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.140 align:middle line:10%
and I don't get scared.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.015 align:middle line:10%
But I'll tell you when
I speak to audiences--

00:08:13.015 --> 00:08:14.598 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But you
don't eat this stuff.

00:08:14.598 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: That's true.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:10%
That's true.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's tough to speak
to young parents who

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:10%
have kids that have
trouble and they

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:10%
realize that the
trouble with the kids

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:10%
may be because of what
they've been feeding them.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Have a cookie.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.693 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Thank you anyway.

00:08:25.693 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:10%


00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There was
a farmer in Canada.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:10%
He was a canola
oil farmer, right?

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:10%
He would plant canola seeds.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:10%
He got involved in a
lawsuit with Monsanto.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:10%
What happened there?

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, he's
been saving seeds year

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:10%
after year for 50 years.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.170 align:middle line:10%
And the neighbors planted
Roundup Ready canola.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.422 align:middle line:10%
And trucks passed by
his farm where the seeds

00:08:54.422 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:10%
blew onto his property.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They just blew over.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.750 align:middle line:10%
So when he sprayed Roundup
near some telephone poles

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:10%
to kill the weeds, it
turns out there was

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:10%
some canola that didn't die.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:10%
And that was the
contaminated variety.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.310 align:middle line:10%
So he did what he did
every single year.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:10%
He harvested his seeds.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.210 align:middle line:10%
He saved some and replanted it.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.150 align:middle line:10%
And that violated the law
according to Monsanto,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.665 align:middle line:10%
because he was planting
their intellectual property.

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did he lose?

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: He lost.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:22.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.855 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And the court
said it didn't matter.

00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:10%
It was accidental.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:10%
It could be wind.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:10%
It could be insects.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:10%
But because it was Monsanto's
intellectual property,

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:10%
he had to, essentially,
give up all of his crops

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:10%
to Monsanto as punishment for
just doing the same thing he'd

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:10%
been doing for 50 years.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.077 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:09:42.077 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:10%
Jeffrey, we are interactive
on "Beyond Belief."

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:10%
We've got a great
studio audience.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:10%
We're going to take
some questions for you.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:10%
And let's start with somebody.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:10%
Just show your hands.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Is there
any genetic engineering

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:10%
that could be positive or safe?

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: I don't discount
the ability for some day

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:10%
to genetically engineer
crops for the betterment

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:10%
of human health and
the environment.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.460 align:middle line:10%
But as one scientist
said, put it back

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:10%
in the laboratory
for 50 to 100 years

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:10%
till you've done your homework.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:10%
Now you can genetically
engineer human genes

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.840 align:middle line:10%
and correct a defective gene.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:10%
And that person will risk
their lives with this procedure

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle line:10%
and some have died,
but it's not putting it

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:10%
into the environment
where it can't be recalled

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:10%
or feeding it to
every individual.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:10%
You can use genetic
engineering in factories

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:10%
to produce pharmaceuticals.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:10%
And if they respect what can go
wrong, and they do it properly,

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.015 align:middle line:10%
that could be very beneficial.

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:10%
But to put it into food
or to put it outdoors

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:10%
is simply not
responsible at this time.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Who
supports the research?

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean is there good
private research

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.482 align:middle line:10%
or is it all through the market?

00:10:42.482 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Unfortunately,
the vast majority

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:10%
of the research done on
GMOs is done by the company

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:10%
that is selling the GMO.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:10%
Now in the United
States, the government

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:10%
doesn't require a single
safety study for the FDA.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:10%
You see, the person in charge
of policy for GMOs at the FDA

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.460 align:middle line:10%
was a former attorney to
the biotech industry, later

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:10%
a biotech executive,
and now back

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.990 align:middle line:10%
at the FDA as the
US food safety czar.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:10%
When he was in charge,
Michael Taylor,

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:10%
he said no testing is
necessary, no labeling

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:10%
is necessary because we're
not aware of any information

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:10%
showing that GMOs--

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wasn't
Michael Taylor working

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.323 align:middle line:10%
for one of those GMO companies?

00:11:20.323 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yes. exactly.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:10%
Before and after.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:10%
Go figure.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.337 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah, really.

00:11:25.337 --> 00:11:27.690 align:middle line:10%
Fox guarding the henhouse,
owning the henhouse.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:32.190 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that the
concept that the FDA was not

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:10%
aware of information showing
that GMOs was different--

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:10%
which was the foundation of this
abdication of responsibility--

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:10%
was a complete fabrication.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.150 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the 44,000 secret
internal memos made public

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:10%
from a lawsuit--

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How many?

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.773 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: 44,000.

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Secret memos.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Secret memos.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:10%
They were made public from
a lawsuit against the FDA.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:10%
You can read them, as I have.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:55.890 align:middle line:10%
They said we have to
test these things,

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:10%
because they can create
allergens, toxins,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:middle line:10%
new diseases,
nutritional problems.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.122 align:middle line:10%
They complained about the
policy of Michael Taylor.

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now in a
moment, we'll come back

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.747 align:middle line:10%
with more of your questions
from the audience.

00:12:06.747 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:10%
But I have just a few more
here for you, Jeffrey,

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.340 align:middle line:10%
before we take a break.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:90%
What's happening right now?

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Is anybody fighting this?

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean where are the
class action lawsuits?

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Someone tried to get
a class action lawsuit out

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:10%
of a judge.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And the judge refused.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.990 align:middle line:10%
It turns out the
judge used to work

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:10%
for one of the biotech companies
as their lawyer of record

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:10%
and never recused himself.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.890 align:middle line:10%
We do have a situation now
where there's so many people

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:10%
unwilling to put these
foods in their mouths

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:10%
that it's having an economic
pressure on the industry.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:10%
And that, I think,
is our saving grace.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:10%
In Europe, when
the gag order was

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.170 align:middle line:10%
lifted on a scientist who
had discovered that GMO were

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:10%
dangerous, over
700 articles were

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:10%
written within a single
month in the UK alone.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:10%
Within 10 weeks, the tipping
point of consumer rejection

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:10%
was achieved.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:10%
And Unilever, and
Nestles, and Hershey's,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:10%
they all said no GMOs
in our European brands.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:10%
But it was not covered
in the United States.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:10%
And so they continue
to sell us the GMOs

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:10%
that they've removed from
their products in Europe.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:10%
But we think as little
as 5% of the US shoppers

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:10%
avoiding GMO
ingredients would be

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:10%
sufficient to create a tipping
point of consumer rejection.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:10%
And we think we're on
the way to achieve that.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.540 align:middle line:10%
And the signs of
that are very clear.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:10%
Non-GMO labels are one of
the fastest growing label

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:10%
claims in America.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:10%
For example, you have on
is this a bag here, it

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.380 align:middle line:10%
has Non-GMO Project Verified.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:10%
So if you see this, you know
that it's been third-party

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:10%
verified as non-GMO.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I like that.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.070 align:middle line:10%
That's important.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:10%
I want to come back to
these products in a moment.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.305 align:middle line:10%
We're going to continue with
"Beyond Belief" with Jeffrey

00:13:43.305 --> 00:13:44.950 align:middle line:10%
Smith in just a moment.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.884 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:47.884 --> 00:13:56.686 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.686 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.950 align:middle line:10%
And welcome back
to "Beyond Belief,"

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory,
Host of the nationally

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:10%
syndicated show
"Coast To Coast AM"

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:10%
with our very special
guests Jeffery Smith.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:10%
And we're talking about
genetically modified foods.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:15.205 align:middle line:10%
So at any point, would you feed
your family some of this stuff?

00:14:15.205 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I know
too much, George.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.793 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I tell you when
I speak to audiences,

00:14:18.793 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:10%
I ask them to rate themselves
at the beginning of the talk

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:10%
how vigilant they've
been in avoiding GMOs.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:10%
And most people are
not very vigilant.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:84%
40 minutes later, they
don't want to touch it.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Even doctors,
they're immediately

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
prescribing non-GMO
diets as soon

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.630 align:middle line:90%
as they hear this information.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:10%
So this does not
get into our house.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Genetically,
scientifically,

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:10%
how did they alter the seeds?

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:10%
How did they alter
the complexity

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:10%
of what we're eating?

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.745 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: So let's say
you want to turn a corn

00:14:44.745 --> 00:14:47.750 align:middle line:10%
plant into a registered
pesticide, which they've done.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:10%
You take a gene
from soil bacteria.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:10%
And you isolate the gene
and make millions of copies

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:10%
and put it into a gun.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:10%
Then you shoot that
gun into a plate

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:10%
of millions of cells hoping
that some of those genes

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:10%
make it into the DNA
of some of those cells.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:10%
Then you clone those
cells into a plant.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:10%
And now every single
cell of the corn plant

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:10%
has a gene-sized
spray bottle which

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:10%
creates this BT toxin that
breaks open little holes

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:10%
in human and insect cells.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What happens when all
those seeds become genetically

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.460 align:middle line:10%
modified?

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:10%
What happens to the
God created seeds

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.300 align:middle line:10%
that we have had for
a long, long time?

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, GMO means
genetically modified organism,

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:84%
but could also
mean God move over.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:84%
It means let us determine
what's going to be in nature.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was one
company's clear goal

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.260 align:middle line:84%
to genetically engineer
100% of all commercial seeds

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:90%
in the world and patent them.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So they're removing the products
of the billions of years

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:84%
of evolution and replacing
it with designer genes

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.530 align:middle line:90%
and designer seeds.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:10%
Now when you plant a
genetically engineered corn

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:10%
plant in one field the pollen
doesn't read the signs.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:10%
It's going to flow
over to the next field.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:10%
Canola can cross-pollinate
with brassicas,

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:10%
which is things we
eat like Brussels

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:10%
sprouts or wild mustard.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:10%
And so what we're already
doing is putting genes

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:10%
into species that have never
existed there in history.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:10%
And they're going to
be there for as long

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:10%
as the gene pool exists.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:10%
So they're going to
outlast global warming

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:10%
and nuclear waste.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:10%
They're going to be
a permanent feature.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:10%
And so you would think
that before doing that,

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:10%
they would extinguish
every single doubt

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.050 align:middle line:10%
before they released
one outdoors.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:10%
And that was the original
theory of the scientists.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:10%
And then in comes
the biotech companies

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:10%
that said we have a
patent on these genes that

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.790 align:middle line:10%
expire in 14 or 17 years.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:10%
We have to make money on
it before we're ready.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:10%
And so they created
this myth that it's

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.630 align:middle line:10%
going to feed the world.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:10%
It's going to increase yields.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.470 align:middle line:10%
It's going to reduce
agricultural chemicals.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:10%
None of that is true.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:10%
But it was sufficient
in their marketing plan

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:10%
to convince and capture
regulatory agencies as well

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle line:10%
as the agronomic industry.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There is a
seed bank in Europe

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:10%
that governments
are putting seeds

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:10%
into in the event of a calamity,

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If we get
destroyed by an asteroid,

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:10%
if something just
cripples this planet,

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.779 align:middle line:10%
are they genetically
modified seeds?

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:15.579 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: No.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Or they're
God given seeds/

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.069 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: They don't touch
the GMOs in that vault.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.869 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:21.789 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, they figured
they want the natural stuff.

00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, they want
the natural stuff.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: For our next generation
after the catastrophe,

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.900 align:middle line:10%
after the flood, they
get the good stuff.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tell me about the most
recent study that has come out.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:10%
That the companies that are
creating GMO foods, of course,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:10%
are saying, oh,
no, that's wrong.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.170 align:middle line:10%
He's wrong.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The industry
stops its feeding studies

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:90%
at a maximum of 90 days.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:10%
So they feed a rat GM
soy or corn for 90 days.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And if it survives
and it does well,

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:84%
they figured, OK, let's feed
the GM soy or corn to humans

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.960 align:middle line:90%
for a lifetime.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.950 align:middle line:10%
So some independent
scientists in France

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:10%
decided to extend
a normal feeding

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:10%
study to two years, a
lifetime of the rats.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:10%
In the first 90 days,
everything was fine.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:10%
But in the next month, they
started getting tumors.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:10%
And by the end of
the study, there

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:10%
was up to 80% of
the female rats had

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:10%
tumors of the mammary glands,
up to 50% of the male rats.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:10%
They died at two or
three times the rate.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:10%
And there was also damage
to the liver, kidneys,

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:10%
and pituitary gland.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:10%
Now this was the most
comprehensive study ever done,

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:10%
the longest study ever done.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:10%
And it should have resulted in
immediate cessation of GMOs.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Russia banned
GM corn within days.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:10%
Kazakhstan did it a month later.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:10%
But the biotech industry mounted
an amazing assault saying, uh,

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:10%
you guys used the wrong rats.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The wrong rats.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: The wrong rats.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:10%
Well, the same rats were
used by the companies

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:10%
to get their GM crops approved.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:10%
They said the rats
are prone to tumors.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.430 align:middle line:10%
But the control groups
only had 20% tumors.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:10%
And it was those that were fed
the genetically modified corn,

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:10%
Roundup Ready corn,
with or without Roundup,

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:10%
or even the Roundup
without the corn,

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:10%
they all had dramatically higher
levels of tumors, early death,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.800 align:middle line:10%
and organ death.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And Jeffrey, I assume
there are no studies done

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:10%
on human beings yet.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:10%
Are there?

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.030 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: One study.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:10%
As we mentioned, it
showed that the genes

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:10%
from soybeans-- you see the
soybeans are Roundup Ready.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.090 align:middle line:10%
They won't die when
sprayed with Roundup.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:10%
The gene transferred into
the DNA of the gut bacteria.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:10%
And the gut bacteria was
unkillable with Roundup,

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.550 align:middle line:10%
suggesting that the Roundup
Ready gene was producing

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:10%
the Roundup Ready
protein continuously

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.955 align:middle line:10%
inside our digestive tract.

00:19:46.955 --> 00:19:47.830 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as this--

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.173 align:middle line:10%
[CLEARING THROAT]

00:19:50.173 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You must have had
some genetically modified corn,

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Jeffrey.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:53.853 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I think so.

00:19:53.853 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Just talking about it is making
me sick, I'm telling you.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:10%
They never actually
followed up to see

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:10%
if the BT gene transfers,
if other genes transfer.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:10%
They immediately cut
all funding to it.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:10%
This was a UK government
that was very pro-GM.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:10%
So we don't know the medical
implications of this.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:10%
But there's no human
feeding trials, really.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable stuff.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.783 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're going to go
through some of the products

00:20:18.783 --> 00:20:20.850 align:middle line:84%
that you've brought
us that are good.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:84%
But very quickly, when
someone's in a supermarket--

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:90%
because these are not labeled--

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:90%
how in the heck do you know?

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we have
a Non-GMO Shopping Guide

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:84%
at nongmoshoppingguide.com which
has over 4,000 products that

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:90%
are verified.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:84%
It's also an iPhone
application called Shop No GMO.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Free.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But generally, you
can buy organic.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:84%
You can buy products
that say non-GMO.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Or you can avoid the
at risk ingredients.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are nine genetically
modified food crops--

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:84%
soy, corn, cottonseed
oil, canola oil,

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
sugar from sugar
beets, alfalfa--

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:90%
which is used for animal hay.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:10%
Then there's papaya from
Hawaii or China only,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:10%
and a little zucchini and
some yellow crookneck squash.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:10%
If it doesn't contain one of
these genetically modified

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.100 align:middle line:10%
crops, then it's not a
genetic modified crop.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then you're OK.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:14.922 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:14.922 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it
weird to walk around

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:10%
with a list in a supermarket
or is that smart?

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: You know,
it's a survival guide.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:10%
It's like we have people
that walk around with the app

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.230 align:middle line:10%
and look at the particular
brands to see which is non-GMO.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:10%
But once you figure
it out, it takes

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:10%
a couple of weeks,
maybe a month,

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.037 align:middle line:10%
and you know which
brands are safe.

00:21:33.037 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:10%
Then you don't have to walk
around with the app anymore.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:10%
You've then replaced.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.540 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people get to what
I call the cupboard stage.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:10%
When they realize that
eating a corn chip

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:10%
might turn your intestinal
flora into a living pesticide

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:10%
factories, they just
throw things out out

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:10%
of their cupboard and say
we're going to be replacing it.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.652 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We're going to be back
in a moment, "Beyond Belief."

00:21:51.652 --> 00:21:52.778 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:54.762 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.762 --> 00:21:57.738 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:57.738 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.070 align:middle line:10%
Welcome back to "Beyond Belief."

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:10%
Jeffrey Smith, our guest on
genetically modified food.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:10%
So you brought us some presents.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:13.910 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: I did.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The good stuff to eat.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.253 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do we know
what the good stuff is?

00:22:18.253 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:10%
What did you bring us?

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, we
have the GMO cookie.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:21.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.465 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And then we
have the non-GMO cookie.

00:22:23.465 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:10%
It says made with
organic almond flour.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But the
GMO cookie looks

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:10%
like it will taste better.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah, well, yeah.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:10%
It's non food to me.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.202 align:middle line:10%
And then we have the
genetically engineered chips.

00:22:35.202 --> 00:22:37.160 align:middle line:10%
And then we have the
non-genetically engineered

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:10%
chips.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:10%
This says Non-GMO
Project Verified.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:10%
So you can look and it also
says made with organic grains.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:10%
So either one of those tells you
that it has no intentional GMOs

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:10%
and that the process was
designed to avoid GMOs.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:55.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Does every package
that is non-GMO say that?

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.470 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: No, you see
you can go to a store

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:10%
and find tomato sauce
that has olive oil.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:10%
And you can find tomato sauce
that has high fructose corn

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:10%
syrup and soybean oil.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't say
non-GMO for the olive oil.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:10%
But we know that olives are
not genetically engineered

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:10%
and soybeans--

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:11.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yet.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:10%
Yet.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:10%
And if we let our
guard down, then there

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:10%
are olives that are
genetically engineered.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.580 align:middle line:10%
And virtually every
single product

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:10%
is genetically engineered at
some place in the pipeline.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.160 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And so it
says right here, right?

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.810 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: USDA Organic.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.205 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And then you know
that you're in good shape.

00:23:29.205 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And then
also on the top here,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:10%
it has the Non-GMO
Project Verified seal.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:10%
So either way.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:10%
But you have to look.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:10%
You have to look.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.560 align:middle line:10%
Especially if you
know there's corn,

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:10%
if you know there's what we
call an at risk ingredient,

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.990 align:middle line:10%
then you have to make sure it's
either organic or says non-GMO.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And Non-GMO Project
Verified is the best label.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So, Jeffrey, what if you
want to go and buy a steak?

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:84%
How do you know that that
cattle, that beef, whatever

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:84%
that animal was wasn't
eating GMO foods?

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.880 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, it would
have to be an organic steak

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.420 align:middle line:10%
or you'd be in
trouble, or 100% grass

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.000 align:middle line:10%
fed where no alfalfa was used.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:10%
So 100% grass fed
used to mean non-GMO.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:10%
But because alfalfa is now
genetically engineered,

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.510 align:middle line:10%
it might have been introduced
in that particular pasture.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.690 align:middle line:10%
Now people ask is it
safe to eat animals

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:10%
that have been eating GMOs?

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:30.470 align:middle line:10%
Well, we know that Roundup
binds with nutrients making

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:10%
them unavailable to plants so
that Roundup Ready crops are

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:10%
nutrient deficient.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:84%
We know that the livestock
in the United States

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:90%
eat mostly Roundup Ready crops--

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
soy, corn, cotton meal,
canola meal, sugar beet pulp,

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and alfalfa.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So there's now being reports
of universal deficiency

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:84%
of certain minerals
in the livestock.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:84%
When there's not enough
minerals, they get sick.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Also the Roundup
directly can be toxic.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And the lab animals
that have been fed GMOs

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.350 align:middle line:84%
have been showing
immune system problems,

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:84%
reproductive problems,
gastrointestinal problems.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're eating animals that
are nutrient deficient and sick.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.220 align:middle line:10%
Now you can decide
whether you think

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:10%
that's going to
be healthy or not.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.480 align:middle line:10%
I think it's not as
healthy as eating animals

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:10%
that are themselves healthy.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:10%
So this is an area where
if you are a meat eater

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:10%
and you want to avoid eating
meat that has been eating GMOs,

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:10%
it's a little
harder than avoiding

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.280 align:middle line:10%
the direct derivatives, because
there's very few options

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.670 align:middle line:10%
for organic meat out there.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.128 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you
know sometimes when

00:25:31.128 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:10%
you wake up in the morning,
you just feel great.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:10%
You're ready to take on the day.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.660 align:middle line:10%
And then other days you
wake up and you don't feel

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.370 align:middle line:10%
that hot for whatever reason.

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:44.330 align:middle line:10%
And you say to yourself,
I know I'm not sick.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:10%
I didn't do anything
different yesterday.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:10%
What's wrong with me?

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:10%
Could it have been because
you may have eaten some GMO

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.430 align:middle line:10%
foods the night before?

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.440 align:middle line:10%
I was at an office of
a doctor who prescribes

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:10%
non-GMO diets to every patient.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:84%
She's prescribed them
to about 5,000 patients.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:90%
She said everyone gets better.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:04.395 align:middle line:90%
It never doesn't work.

00:26:04.395 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:10%
I said I've got to
see this for myself.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: So I started
interviewing the patients.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.310 align:middle line:10%
And some people
described exactly what

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:10%
you're talking about, that
they wake up in the mornings

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.570 align:middle line:10%
and they just feel
heavy and dull.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And they switch their
diet to non-GMO foods,

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.748 align:middle line:90%
and they discovered mornings.

00:26:19.748 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:84%
They had a morning
for the first time

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.908 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't feel terrible.

00:26:22.908 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And actually the doctor
had it down to a science.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.200 align:middle line:84%
She said for anxiety, and
depression, and heaviness,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and lethargy, it's gone almost
immediately on a non-GMO diet.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.800 align:middle line:84%
For allergies and asthma, it
can take three or five days.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.320 align:middle line:84%
For gastrointestinal disorders,
up to a month and then

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:84%
some people get
better over two years.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And she could predict it
because she had been doing it

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.980 align:middle line:90%
for years with her patients.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Every once
in a blue moon,

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:10%
every once in a blue moon, I
will do a little kind of binge.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:48.740 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.282 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: This is a
confessional, huh?

00:26:50.282 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I have been known
to eat a lot of these.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.540 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Don't do
it in front of me.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.082 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'm not
going to eat it now,

00:26:55.082 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:10%
but I remember eating half a bag
once-- because once you start,

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.580 align:middle line:10%
it's difficult to stop.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.880 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, I felt
like someone put a vacuum up

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to my mouth and shot
it into me not out.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean I just felt sluggish.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.790 align:middle line:90%
And it might have been that.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.010 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And bloating,
or some people talk

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:10%
about just general indigestion.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.400 align:middle line:10%
See, as we talked about,
if each one of these

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:10%
is producing a toxic
protein that drills

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:10%
holes in the human
cells, if there's ways

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:10%
that undigested food can get
into the bloodstream-- see,

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:10%
normally, it's digested down
into very, very tiny pieces

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.850 align:middle line:10%
before it gets into
the bloodstream.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:10%
But if it gets into
the bloodstream

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.980 align:middle line:10%
as undigested pieces,
the body reacts to it

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.502 align:middle line:10%
and creates an antibody response
which is an allergic response.

00:27:45.502 --> 00:27:47.710 align:middle line:10%
And that can create inflammation
throughout the body.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.420 align:middle line:10%
And it could lead to a lot
of different disease states.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:10%
But then also you
have the little villi,

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.870 align:middle line:10%
the little fingers along
the intestinal walls,

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:10%
they've been shown to
be destroyed or damaged

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.150 align:middle line:10%
by the same toxin that
this is producing.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:04.810 align:middle line:10%
So you may end up with all sorts
of gastrointestinal disorders.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:07.030 align:middle line:10%
And the Roundup
Ready soy has been

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:10.895 align:middle line:10%
shown to create a suppression
of the digestive enzymes

00:28:10.895 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:10%
in the animals in
the laboratories that

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.870 align:middle line:10%
are fed the GM soy.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:10%
So now you have a weak,
sick digestive track.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:10%
And then you're putting
more food into it.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.550 align:middle line:10%
Of course, you're going to
feel bad if these, in fact, are

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.050 align:middle line:10%
happening inside you.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, any seed
that has been genetically

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.640 align:middle line:10%
modified to fight an
insect or to fight

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.980 align:middle line:10%
a pesticide in some weed
can't be that great for you.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.870 align:middle line:10%
So let me ask you this, is
the genetically modified seed

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:42.520 align:middle line:10%
contained part of that
chemical that would fight off

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.180 align:middle line:10%
the weed or the little insect?

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:44.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.770 align:middle line:10%
The actual gene that's put
inside the seed that then

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.835 align:middle line:10%
replicates into every
single cell of the plant,

00:28:50.835 --> 00:28:52.210 align:middle line:10%
it is like a little
spray bottle.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:10%
It produces the toxic protein.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So we could take,
like, a teaspoon of the Roundup

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:10%
Ready.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:10%
What's the difference?

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.588 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, with Roundup
Ready, it's a little different.

00:29:00.588 --> 00:29:04.000 align:middle line:10%
With Roundup Ready,
it produces a protein

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:10%
that allows the crop to
be sprayed with Roundup.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:10%
So the gene doesn't produce
the Roundup the weed killer,

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.760 align:middle line:10%
it produces something
that allows the plant

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.870 align:middle line:10%
to drink the weed killer and
then deposit a portion of it

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.100 align:middle line:10%
in the food we eat.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A portion of it.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How much?

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:10%
And it is in such high amounts
that smaller amounts than that

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.460 align:middle line:10%
can wipe out the gut
bacteria, because Roundup

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.900 align:middle line:10%
has been patented, its active
ingredient, as a bio side that

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.270 align:middle line:10%
kills the beneficial
gut bacteria.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:40.410 align:middle line:10%
Now when animals eat so
much Roundup Ready crops,

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.790 align:middle line:10%
then it kills some of
the beneficial bacteria.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.310 align:middle line:10%
And their job is to keep
in check the botulism,

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:10%
the botulism bacteria.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.590 align:middle line:10%
And when these animals
eat the Roundup,

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:10%
then the botulism
bacteria can expand.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:10%
And there is now an epidemic of
botulism in certain countries.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.810 align:middle line:10%
And then the botulism
gets into the food supply.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.840 align:middle line:10%
And they found that
botulinum toxin is now

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.360 align:middle line:10%
associated with Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:10%
and with chronic fatigue.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.920 align:middle line:10%
So we may be seeing Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.500 align:middle line:10%
and chronic fatigue
symptoms on the rise

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.120 align:middle line:10%
because of the
Roundup Ready crops,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.480 align:middle line:10%
because of how it kills off
the beneficial gut bacteria

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.010 align:middle line:10%
in animals and possibly humans.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's
the story in India?

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.340 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Oh, boy.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:25.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where farmers had
cows die and it wiped them out.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.280 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: In India, there is
genetically engineered BT

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.080 align:middle line:10%
cotton.

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.650 align:middle line:10%
Just like the corn chips produce
their own toxic insecticide,

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:10%
so too does their cotton
seeds and their cotton plants.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:10%
So first of all, the
farmers touching the cotton

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.170 align:middle line:10%
are getting rashes and
itching all over their bodies.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.130 align:middle line:10%
They allow their animals
to graze on cotton plants

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:45.943 align:middle line:10%
after harvest.

00:30:45.943 --> 00:30:47.110 align:middle line:10%
They've done that for years.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Animals eat cotton?

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.170 align:middle line:10%
I never knew that.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: They eat the
plants, the plants.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:50.610 align:middle line:10%
Kind of take the cotton out.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:50.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They take
the cotton out.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.060 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: They get the plants.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.143 align:middle line:10%
And I've actually seen it.

00:30:53.143 --> 00:30:57.220 align:middle line:10%
I've seen an entire herd of
sheep devour all the cotton

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.720 align:middle line:10%
plants after harvest.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:10%
But I also visited
a village where

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.200 align:middle line:10%
they allowed their buffalo
to graze on cotton plants

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:10%
successfully for eight years.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But they allowed
their Buffalo to graze

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.040 align:middle line:84%
on BT cotton plants, this
toxic producing cotton

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:84%
plants for one day, and all 13
buffalo died within three days.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.120 align:middle line:90%
They lost 26 goats and sheep.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of sheep,
thousands of buffalo

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.608 align:middle line:84%
have died as a result
of eating the BT cotton.

00:31:23.608 --> 00:31:25.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Didn't some
of these farmers

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.980 align:middle line:10%
commit suicide
because they were so

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.450 align:middle line:10%
despondent over what happened?

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, the suicide is
from something that's related.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.877 align:middle line:84%
They were convinced
that BT cotton--

00:31:34.877 --> 00:31:36.460 align:middle line:84%
this genetically
modified cotton-- was

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.140 align:middle line:90%
going to make them rich.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.620 align:middle line:10%
It was going to
have huge, huge--

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They were all excited.

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:41.648 align:middle line:10%
So they borrowed money.

00:31:41.648 --> 00:31:43.107 align:middle line:10%
They couldn't get
it from the bank,

00:31:43.107 --> 00:31:44.370 align:middle line:10%
so they go to the loan sharks.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.833 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: They buy
at 7% per month.

00:31:46.833 --> 00:31:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The money changers.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, the
money changers.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.992 align:middle line:84%
And then they buy the
genetically engineered seeds

00:31:51.992 --> 00:31:53.200 align:middle line:90%
and the associated chemicals.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.340 align:middle line:90%
And they plant them.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And because genetic engineering
creates unpredicted side

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.830 align:middle line:84%
effects, a lot of
the farmers ended up

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:84%
with yields they were unable
to even pay back their loans.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.355 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been a
vast amount of suicides.

00:32:06.355 --> 00:32:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Over 200,000 farmers committing
suicide who planted the--

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 200,000
farmers in India?

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: In India.

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Committing suicide.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Who planted
the BT cotton.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they're
financially ruined.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Because they're going to give
up their land that they've had

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:21.810 align:middle line:90%
in their family for generations.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a tremendous
source of shame.

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:26.233 align:middle line:10%
They can't pay for the
dowries of their daughters.

00:32:26.233 --> 00:32:27.900 align:middle line:10%
They don't want to
deal with that shame.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.298 align:middle line:10%
So they drink the pesticides.

00:32:30.298 --> 00:32:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the money
changers now own the land.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.407 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:32:33.407 --> 00:32:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And is this continuing?

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It is.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:10%
In fact, there was
one biotech company

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:40.900 align:middle line:10%
that was kicked out
of a state in India

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.610 align:middle line:10%
because of low performance.

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why doesn't that
get publicity in this country?

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.720 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge story.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.137 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: There's been kind of
a lockdown of the mainstream

00:32:49.137 --> 00:32:49.937 align:middle line:10%
media.

00:32:49.937 --> 00:32:51.354 align:middle line:10%
That's been going
on for 15 years.

00:32:51.354 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, we've
got to change that.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:10%
Let's take some questions
from our audience right here.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.590 align:middle line:84%
We'll take some of your
questions for Jeffrey Smith.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.340 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: My question
would be regarding

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.230 align:middle line:10%
the soil and the groundwater.

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.920 align:middle line:10%
So when you have
these GMO plants,

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.900 align:middle line:10%
are they studying
how much is actually

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:13.025 align:middle line:10%
getting into soil and,
subsequently, groundwater?

00:33:13.025 --> 00:33:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
great question, Jeff.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:16.550 align:middle line:84%
It permeates into the
system, doesn't it?

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:10%
The entire biosphere
is being affected.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.740 align:middle line:10%
These crops get
drenched with Roundup.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.165 align:middle line:10%
More than 80% of the GM
crops are herbicide tolerant.

00:33:27.165 --> 00:33:29.260 align:middle line:10%
And most of that
is Roundup Ready.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.650 align:middle line:10%
Now Roundup kills the
beneficial bacteria in the soil.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.950 align:middle line:10%
It promotes soil-borne
pathogens, diseases,

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:38.380 align:middle line:10%
that overrun the crops.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:10%
So the use of Roundup with
such high, high, millions,

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.590 align:middle line:10%
and millions of
pounds of Roundup

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.290 align:middle line:10%
has promoted more
than 40 plant diseases

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.020 align:middle line:10%
as a permanent feature
now of US agriculture.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.540 align:middle line:10%
It also kills some of the
bacteria which creates

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.490 align:middle line:10%
the spongy absorption quality.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.587 align:middle line:10%
And so you end up with
Roundup Ready fields

00:33:56.587 --> 00:33:57.920 align:middle line:10%
where the water doesn't go down.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.800 align:middle line:10%
It remains in puddles
and washes off,

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.450 align:middle line:10%
which can promote flooding.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.610 align:middle line:10%
And the Roundup
can remain active

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:06.070 align:middle line:10%
in the soil for months or years.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:10%
The longest recorded
half life for degradation

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:12.909 align:middle line:10%
of its active
ingredient was 22 years.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:15.730 align:middle line:10%
Then you have the BT
toxin which kills off

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:17.409 align:middle line:10%
certain aspects of the soil.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:19.510 align:middle line:10%
That binds with clay
and can remain active

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:20.830 align:middle line:10%
for months or years.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:25.000 align:middle line:10%
And then the Roundup can
get into the water supply.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.040 align:middle line:10%
It's actually in
the air samples.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:10%
It's in the rain samples.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.449 align:middle line:10%
It's in the surface water.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:29.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's everywhere.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.813 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: It's in the
urine of city dwellers.

00:34:31.813 --> 00:34:34.750 align:middle line:10%
It's in the blood of pregnant
women and their unborn fetuses.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.239 align:middle line:10%
And then you have the
BT toxin which gets

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:38.920 align:middle line:10%
washed into the river system.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.110 align:middle line:10%
And that kills
caddisflies, which are

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:43.000 align:middle line:10%
part of the marine ecosystem.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.768 align:middle line:10%
And so it is changing the
entire ecosystem in the soil,

00:34:46.768 --> 00:34:48.310 align:middle line:10%
in the water, and
in the marine life.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did
this happen so fast?

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:54.963 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, we have 94%
of the soybeans in the United

00:34:54.963 --> 00:34:56.380 align:middle line:10%
States are genetically
engineered.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 94%.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:01.990 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: 93% of the cotton,
95% of the sugar beets.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.920 align:middle line:10%
I mean it's huge.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.110 align:middle line:10%
When they take over,
they take over.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.530 align:middle line:10%
And it's sort of like I've
traveled to 34 countries

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.650 align:middle line:10%
and I have been amazed at
how the biotech industry has

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.860 align:middle line:10%
had a incredible influence
all over the world.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.160 align:middle line:10%
They capture certain
ministers of agriculture--

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, the
lobby must be huge.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:19.480 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: It's amazing.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.938 align:middle line:10%
And I've talked to
people that said

00:35:20.938 --> 00:35:23.230 align:middle line:10%
when they were meeting
with a biotech company,

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:24.690 align:middle line:10%
they said, oh, you
should be paid.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.890 align:middle line:10%
You should have a very
high paying job with us

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.510 align:middle line:10%
after you finish your work here.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.210 align:middle line:10%
Their work there was to
approve the company's products.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.030 align:middle line:10%
And the job was
going to be a reward.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:10%
In Canada, when bovine growth
hormone was being evaluated,

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.450 align:middle line:10%
the scientists there said
that they were offered a bribe

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.200 align:middle line:10%
by the company of $1
million to $2 million

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.620 align:middle line:10%
to approve it without
further study.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Indonesian officials,
140 of them,

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.950 align:middle line:84%
were given bribes or
questionable payments.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
fine to the company.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Have you ever been
approached to get bought out,

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:54.770 align:middle line:10%
to shut you up?

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:55.570 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: No.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:57.110 align:middle line:10%
But I'll tell you
what, I'm thinking

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:10%
that I have to have a price.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.030 align:middle line:10%
If they can give me so
many millions of dollars

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.572 align:middle line:10%
that I can then give
to our Institute

00:36:02.572 --> 00:36:04.980 align:middle line:10%
for Responsible Technology,
I'll walk and let

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:10%
the millions of dollars.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So if you turn
down an interview next time,

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:08.710 align:middle line:10%
I'll know what happened to you.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.725 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: I have a price.

00:36:09.725 --> 00:36:12.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's take some more
questions from the audience

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.160 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:10%
Yes, go ahead.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:16.890 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.320 align:middle line:10%
I've listened to Jeffrey Smith--

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.345 align:middle line:10%
George Noory, I usually
listen to him on YouTube

00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:24.720 align:middle line:10%
and it's great when I
can't stay up all night.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.830 align:middle line:10%
My question is so if you
eat a lot of GMO foods.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.300 align:middle line:10%
You start getting sick.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.370 align:middle line:10%
Your doctor tells
you not to eat them.

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.950 align:middle line:10%
Can you get rid of
the GMO, the poisons,

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.472 align:middle line:10%
the toxins out of your
system from eating them?

00:36:38.472 --> 00:36:39.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And first
of all, Jeffrey,

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.630 align:middle line:10%
the doctor probably
won't tell you not

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.380 align:middle line:10%
to eat it because most of
them aren't aware of this.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.050 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Thousands of doctors
prescribe non-GMO diets.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:52.830 align:middle line:10%
But many, many more have never
really heard of the problem.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:55.350 align:middle line:10%
Now it's a very common question.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:57.780 align:middle line:10%
What about the gut bacteria
that I have that might be--

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.238 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And how
long does it stay?

00:36:59.238 --> 00:37:01.260 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: How long-- we
don't know the answer

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.670 align:middle line:10%
to that question specifically.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.300 align:middle line:10%
But we do know that people are
getting better dramatically,

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.210 align:middle line:10%
very quickly from a variety
of diseases and disorders

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:10.920 align:middle line:10%
when they switch to non-GMO.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.250 align:middle line:10%
When mice were fed genetically
modified soy for eight months,

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.250 align:middle line:10%
they had damage to their
testicles, to their pancreas,

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.540 align:middle line:10%
and to their livers.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.540 align:middle line:10%
When the same mice were
switched to non-GM soy

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.590 align:middle line:10%
for the next month, a lot of
the damage started to reverse.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:10%
We talked to a pig farmer who
had massive problems with birth

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:34.230 align:middle line:10%
defects, ulcers, bloat,
diarrhea, low conception

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.910 align:middle line:10%
rates, low litter size.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.900 align:middle line:10%
Took the same animals off of
GM soy, put them on non-GM soy,

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.670 align:middle line:10%
and all of that reversed.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:10%
We saw animals in
South Africa that

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.300 align:middle line:10%
were put on GM soy,
massive health problems.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.100 align:middle line:10%
They put them on--

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:10%
I mean corn.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.460 align:middle line:10%
They put them on non-GM corn,
the problems disappeared.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:10%
The guy ran out, had to
go back to the GM corn.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.330 align:middle line:10%
The problems came back.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.310 align:middle line:10%
Then found that the
source of non-GM corn

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.070 align:middle line:10%
permanently and the problems
were permanently gone.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:02.340 align:middle line:10%
So there is a correlation
very, very rapidly

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.740 align:middle line:10%
in switching the diet and
changing the symptoms.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And that's important
because if you're off it

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.190 align:middle line:10%
for a while, your system
could clean itself out.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:13.280 align:middle line:10%
We don't know what it
means, though, long term.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.080 align:middle line:10%
That's the problem.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:14.940 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And some
people tell me they

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.760 align:middle line:10%
can eat soy and corn in Europe,
but not in the United States.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.647 align:middle line:10%
In Europe, it's non-GMO.

00:38:19.647 --> 00:38:21.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And we're going
to come right back.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.907 align:middle line:10%
"Beyond Belief," right
here with Jeffrey Smith.

00:38:24.907 --> 00:38:27.342 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:27.342 --> 00:38:29.290 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:39.030 align:middle line:90%


00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.840 align:middle line:10%
And welcome back to "Beyond
Belief" with Jeffrey Smith,

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.180 align:middle line:10%
our expert on genetically
modified foods.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.010 align:middle line:10%
Jeffrey, do you ever
wake up in the morning

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.850 align:middle line:10%
and feel like somebody
is watching you?

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:53.350 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: You know,
I wouldn't put it

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.560 align:middle line:10%
past the biotech industry
or their enforcement ring

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.110 align:middle line:10%
in Washington to
be reading my email

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:10%
and listening to my phone.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:02.850 align:middle line:10%
But I just don't pay
attention to that,

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.320 align:middle line:10%
because I'm pretty much
open with everything

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.210 align:middle line:10%
that I say and do.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.180 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes whistleblowers come to
me with pretty hot information

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.550 align:middle line:10%
and I have to make sure that
their information remains

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:13.570 align:middle line:10%
protected.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.980 align:middle line:10%
But you know, right now,
there is a wave going on.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.860 align:middle line:10%
There is a huge wave
of anti GMO sentiment.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.810 align:middle line:10%
And now I'm just
riding the wave.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has
been in your career

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:84%
the most heartening story
related to all of this

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.380 align:middle line:90%
that you've ever heard?

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, it's interesting.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.157 align:middle line:10%
I was on your show on
September 16, 2003--

00:39:34.157 --> 00:39:35.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, you
remember the dates.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.500 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Yeah, because it
was like a week after--

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You've probably
been on 40 times already.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.060 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: That's true.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.150 align:middle line:10%
And in the spring
of the next year,

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:46.240 align:middle line:10%
someone came up to
me in a bookstore

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.420 align:middle line:10%
and said I listened to
you on "Coast to Coast"

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:10%
and it changed my life.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:55.040 align:middle line:10%
And it was the first
time I had heard that.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.063 align:middle line:10%
I've heard it many
times since then.

00:39:57.063 --> 00:39:58.480 align:middle line:10%
People come up to
me and they just

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:10%
started to cry because they say
that the information that we

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.010 align:middle line:10%
presented saved their
kids or something.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.680 align:middle line:10%
But this was the first time.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:10%
And it was like a revelation
that what I'm saying

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:10%
is translating into people
changing their diet.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.380 align:middle line:10%
And that's translating
into people

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.750 align:middle line:10%
feeling better and
being healthier.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.380 align:middle line:10%
And it's changing their lives.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.920 align:middle line:10%
So thank you for
that opportunity.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.110 align:middle line:10%
And it gave me an
opportunity to really feel

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.310 align:middle line:10%
the blessing of that person.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:26.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, but the
thanks it goes to you,

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.220 align:middle line:10%
because you're the one
who sticks your neck out.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.770 align:middle line:10%
And we're merely
the facilitators.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.920 align:middle line:10%
You know, I've got to thank
Gaiam TV and everybody who's

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.970 align:middle line:10%
here to have the guts to want
to get this kind of information

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.180 align:middle line:10%
out.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.420 align:middle line:10%
We know how big
the lobby can be.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.480 align:middle line:10%
We know how strong
they are financially.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.780 align:middle line:10%
But there is a huge difference
between what's right

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.160 align:middle line:10%
and what's wrong.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.210 align:middle line:10%
And I'm concerned about my
children, and my grandchildren,

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:59.020 align:middle line:10%
and the kind of planet we're
going to leave behind for them.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And it is so important that
we at least give people

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:04.738 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to make
up their own minds.

00:41:04.738 --> 00:41:06.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not
going to be the one

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.130 align:middle line:84%
to say buy genetically
modified foods, don't buy it.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:09.970 align:middle line:90%
That's up to you.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.803 align:middle line:84%
You know, when people
come up to me and say,

00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:13.120 align:middle line:90%
do you get flu shots, George?

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.740 align:middle line:90%
I say, no, I don't.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.890 align:middle line:90%
But that's up to you.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.670 align:middle line:10%
If you want to get a flu
shot, you go ahead do it.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.870 align:middle line:10%
It's the same with this.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.150 align:middle line:10%
We need to give people
the information.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.100 align:middle line:10%
They need to be able to look
at packages like this and say,

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.430 align:middle line:10%
all right, it
doesn't contain GMO,

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.770 align:middle line:10%
I want to buy it or I don't.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.990 align:middle line:10%
Maybe that ear of
corn that is GMO

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.720 align:middle line:10%
only costs $0.05
an ear as opposed

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:10%
to a one that is organic
that might cost $0.15,

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.630 align:middle line:10%
but let them at least
make up their own minds.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so important
about what we're doing here.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going
to stop doing that.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:50.050 align:middle line:10%
With all that, as you look at
this, what's the future hold?

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.330 align:middle line:10%
What does your
crystal ball tell you?

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:55.450 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well,
there are 30 states

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.460 align:middle line:10%
that have
organizations that want

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:01.420 align:middle line:10%
to create mandatory labeling
bills or ballot initiatives.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:04.490 align:middle line:84%
There were 19 bills introduced
in the last 12 months.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.657 align:middle line:84%
None of them got passed
the influence, peddling,

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and lobbying of the
biotech industry--

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.800 align:middle line:84%
even blatant threats to sue
Vermont or Connecticut--

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.480 align:middle line:90%
if they required labeling.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.550 align:middle line:90%
But now, it's on fire.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I have never
seen the kind of enthusiasm,

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and deep education,
and knowledge

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:24.280 align:middle line:84%
that people have about
GMOs in the United States.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.890 align:middle line:84%
As I spent 3 and 1/2 months
traveling up and down

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:30.780 align:middle line:84%
California, people were
devoted to this issue.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.530 align:middle line:84%
It was front and
center for them.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think it should be,
because when in our lives

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.170 align:middle line:84%
have we been dealing
with a technology

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:40.120 align:middle line:84%
that it could affect
every living being

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.160 align:middle line:90%
and all future generations?

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.100 align:middle line:10%
Except for all out
nuclear war, there's

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:50.170 align:middle line:10%
nothing like this that has the
imprint or the impact on so

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.460 align:middle line:10%
many things.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.860 align:middle line:10%
And so we have
now an opportunity

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.350 align:middle line:10%
to do greater good
than our ancestors had

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:58.870 align:middle line:10%
by stopping this, because
we can then protect,

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:01.210 align:middle line:10%
all living beings, and
all future generations,

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.870 align:middle line:10%
and your grandchildren, and your
great-great-grandchildren, et

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:04.730 align:middle line:10%
cetera.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So that is dawning on
the minds of people

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:08.530 align:middle line:90%
who are now aware of this.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And I mean there's
religious groups that

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.720 align:middle line:90%
think GMO means God move over.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.990 align:middle line:10%
And we have a website
Faith and GMOs.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:18.010 align:middle line:10%
It's like a joke.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.410 align:middle line:10%
We had a rabbi, a
swami, and three priests

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:21.380 align:middle line:10%
walk into a studio.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:22.180 align:middle line:10%
And we did.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.110 align:middle line:10%
We videotaped them.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:26.570 align:middle line:10%
And they're all basically saying
this is against God's plan.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.170 align:middle line:10%
So my prediction is this--

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:32.110 align:middle line:10%
I think we are going to
see mandatory labeling,

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.610 align:middle line:10%
because I think
some of these states

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.120 align:middle line:10%
are going to be successful.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.050 align:middle line:10%
And I think either way,
there are so many people

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:41.640 align:middle line:10%
avoiding GMOs, looking
for the voluntary labels

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.560 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to see economic
pressure on the companies.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to say, OK,
we started to lose market share.

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:50.020 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to keep GMOs
because there's no consumer

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.040 align:middle line:10%
benefit.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.680 align:middle line:10%
We've already got rid of bovine
growth hormone out of Walmart,

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.230 align:middle line:10%
Starbucks, Yoplait, Dannon,
most American dairies

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.270 align:middle line:10%
because of the link to
cancer from the drug-injected

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:00.130 align:middle line:10%
into cows.

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:01.960 align:middle line:10%
We can see the same
kind of tipping point.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.480 align:middle line:10%
And I think it will happen
very soon in the United States.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I was going to ask you,
why aren't these companies that

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.100 align:middle line:10%
are making products like
this, that are making cookies

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.890 align:middle line:10%
like this, why aren't they
stepping up to the plate

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:15.400 align:middle line:10%
right now and saying we're
not going to accept this?

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.280 align:middle line:10%
We don't want your GMO products.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:10%
We're going to put in
natural ingredients.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.830 align:middle line:10%
It is price?

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:20.680 align:middle line:10%
What is it?

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.800 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, right now, if
you just buy commodity corn,

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.650 align:middle line:10%
it's genetically engineered,
because it's been mixed in.

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:29.710 align:middle line:10%
If they want to go to non-GMO,
they'll have to pay extra.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.630 align:middle line:10%
If everyone goes
to non-GMO, there

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:33.190 align:middle line:10%
won't be a price difference.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:35.500 align:middle line:10%
But the same companies
removed GMOs in Europe

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.570 align:middle line:10%
and didn't charge
consumers more.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.420 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to raise
prices, if they switch.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.600 align:middle line:10%
The same ADM and
Cargill, et cetera,

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.930 align:middle line:10%
they already have non-GMO
availability for soy and corn,

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.510 align:middle line:10%
they'll just expand that
and make it more available.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:52.330 align:middle line:10%
So the industry will adjust.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:55.870 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to be a
big economic problem.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:57.770 align:middle line:10%
But they just like
the status quo.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.430 align:middle line:10%
They just said we'll just hide
the fact that we're using GMOs.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:02.770 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the major
food companies

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:06.790 align:middle line:10%
contributed to over $47
million spent in California

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:09.070 align:middle line:10%
to disinform people
so that they can

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:12.160 align:middle line:10%
continue to hide the fact
that they're using GMOs.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The supermarkets
that coin themselves

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:19.750 align:middle line:84%
as being natural or organic, do
they still sell GMO-type foods

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.430 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in that store?

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:26.230 align:middle line:10%
There are some stores that have
eliminated GMOs completely.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:28.300 align:middle line:10%
But they're the exception.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:32.170 align:middle line:10%
Even the natural supermarkets,
maybe most of their products

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:36.175 align:middle line:10%
are non-GMO, but they haven't
yet eliminated the GMOs

00:45:36.175 --> 00:45:37.300 align:middle line:10%
as a policy.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:41.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So again, the
consumer needs to sort through.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So an event at the
store which normally

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:47.440 align:middle line:84%
would have taken 20 minutes
could take an hour, maybe two.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.270 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: The first
time, the second time.

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:51.580 align:middle line:10%
You basically, you
learn the brands

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.780 align:middle line:10%
and you know where to go.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:56.540 align:middle line:10%
So it may seem like
a daunting task.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:57.340 align:middle line:10%
It was interesting.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.140 align:middle line:10%
I was being interviewed
on another TV show

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.470 align:middle line:10%
and the guy said he tried
to get his parents to switch

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.670 align:middle line:10%
their foods for years.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.770 align:middle line:10%
And so they gave
him one of my DVDs.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.510 align:middle line:10%
And then the father
who was on the set

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:09.635 align:middle line:10%
said, and the next day, I
didn't recognize anything

00:46:09.635 --> 00:46:11.635 align:middle line:10%
in the refrigerator because
his wife had seen it

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:12.660 align:middle line:10%
and replaced everything.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Look, my son's wife--

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:15.970 align:middle line:10%
they have two little
grandchildren.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:18.340 align:middle line:10%
They're living in
St. Louis right now--

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:22.630 align:middle line:10%
has taken the two little
kids, three and one

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:27.850 align:middle line:10%
off sugar, which I'm convinced
was genetically modified sugar.

00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:32.800 align:middle line:10%
And she said, Grandpa George--
they call me Papa Giorgio--

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:39.190 align:middle line:10%
what a tremendous difference
that we saw in one day

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:41.180 align:middle line:10%
after taking them
off stuff like that.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.660 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, Papa Giorgio,
it works like that all over.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.980 align:middle line:10%
It works like that all over.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.460 align:middle line:10%
And sugar, most of the
sugar, is sugar beet sugar.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.538 align:middle line:10%
Sugar also by itself.

00:46:49.538 --> 00:46:51.580 align:middle line:10%
I mean even if it weren't
genetically engineered,

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.840 align:middle line:10%
it has some particular--

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.170 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of reactivity
among many children.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:59.110 align:middle line:10%
But right now, children
are most at risk

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.030 align:middle line:10%
from the potential
dangers of GMOs.

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.230 align:middle line:10%
They don't have a developed
blood-brain barrier.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.080 align:middle line:10%
They don't have
developed gut bacteria.

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.640 align:middle line:10%
They eat more per pound.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.730 align:middle line:10%
They have more reactivity
to toxins and allergens.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.230 align:middle line:10%
And what are we seeing
in the next generation?

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.530 align:middle line:10%
I have pediatricians
lining up saying

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:16.900 align:middle line:10%
we're seeing complex
diseases that we've never

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.640 align:middle line:10%
seen before in children.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.740 align:middle line:10%
Crohn's disease, irritable
bowel, allergies,

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:24.580 align:middle line:10%
allergic to everything, and
these are, what we think,

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.020 align:middle line:10%
are the canaries
in the coal mine.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:30.280 align:middle line:10%
These are the people who
are reacting to the GMOs,

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.920 align:middle line:10%
to the leaky gut, to the
toxins in the food supply.

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.632 align:middle line:10%
And so this is
where I think we're

00:47:35.632 --> 00:47:37.840 align:middle line:10%
going to see the greatest
resistance and the greatest

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.680 align:middle line:10%
change--

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.603 align:middle line:10%
parents protecting their kids.

00:47:40.603 --> 00:47:42.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I would say
that our "Coast to Coast"

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:47.930 align:middle line:10%
audience and our Gaiam TV
audience, they understand this.

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:49.300 align:middle line:10%
They know the subject matter.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.850 align:middle line:10%
But what percent of the
American public out there,

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:55.570 align:middle line:10%
or people in Canada and North
America, or all over the world

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:58.960 align:middle line:10%
don't understand the
possibilities of GMO foods?

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.820 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, three
years ago, if you

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.520 align:middle line:10%
asked the average
American how many of you

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.890 align:middle line:10%
have eaten a genetically
engineered food in your life?

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:07.460 align:middle line:10%
60% say no.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:08.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 60%.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:09.550 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: 15% say I don't know.

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:10.540 align:middle line:10%
And they say it while
they're reading a GMO.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's crazy.

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:12.610 align:middle line:10%
Jeffrey, give us your websites.

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:13.550 align:middle line:10%
People want to
get a hold of you.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:13.780 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:14.863 align:middle line:10%
