00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.580 align:middle line:10%
We have an amazing guest--
back with Nick Pope who worked

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:10%
for the British government
for 21 years at the Ministry

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:10%
of Defence, the UK equivalent
of the US Department of Defense.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:84%
He now works as a
broadcaster journalist

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and is one of the
world's leading experts

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
on UFOs, the unexplained,
and conspiracy theories.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Nick, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK POPE: Thank you.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be back.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are one of
the best investigators

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.210 align:middle line:90%
I have ever interviewed.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to know
that before we start.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Thank you.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Quite by accident.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.410 align:middle line:10%
I had been in the Ministry
of Defence for some years.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:10%
And they move you
around every few years--

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:10%
level transfer--

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: --promotion.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:10%
The UFO job became
available just at the time

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:10%
I was due for a move, so it
was right place, right time.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they label
it as the "UFO job"

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:90%
on the Ministry of Defence?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Colloquially, yes.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Officially, the title was
secretariat air staff 2A.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.515 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't really mean
much to anyone, so they just--

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:90%
does what it says on the term.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:84%
When you started
getting involved in this

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the files,
I mean, were you in shock?

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes, I was.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't really
know anything about this.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, it's
just crazy stuff, right?

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And then I
pulled out these files.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.990 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wait a minute.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Pilots?

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Our own pilots in the military
are seeing these things,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
chasing them, tracking
them on radar.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.968 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And see,
that's what's going on,

00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
with here in the
United States now,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
as they're revealing
some videos.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.567 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look at several
videos during the program.

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to want you to
talk about it with me as we

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:90%
look at them.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's truly remarkable
what's been going on.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if those
people who never believed

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:84%
those people in the
UFO field are now

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:90%
sitting back going, oh, my God.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
These people were
right, weren't they?

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: That's exactly what's
happened, that the narrative

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:90%
has been flipped 180 degrees.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
This subject has come out of
the fringe into the mainstream.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And we are in a totally
different ball game.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
it in the files

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.265 align:middle line:84%
that you first saw that
just blew your mind?

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:46.765 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I think it was
the Rendlesham Forest incident.

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:47.598 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great case.

00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Tell us quickly about that.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Britain's
Roswell, December 1980,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:90%
not just lights in the sky.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Something lands,
tracked on radar,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:84%
multiple military witnesses,
including the deputy base

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
commander and physical
trace evidence--

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:90%
burn marks in the trees.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Did they touch the object, too?

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: One of the
witnesses touched it.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:84%
The Defence Intelligence Staff
in the Ministry of Defence said

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
that radioactivity levels
at the landing site seemed

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:84%
significantly higher than
the average background.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And didn't somebody
get physically sick

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
from being too
close to the object?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Several of
the witnesses did.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is very interesting
and controversial.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.340 align:middle line:84%
It was referenced in a
classified British intelligence

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
assessment code named
Project Condign.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And it talked about
proximity to what

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
we call UAP radiation,
UAP being Unidentified

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Aerial Phenomena, the official
military term for UFOs.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some video
that I want you to look at.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And describe with me what you
think we're seeing, of course.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
The video was just published
by the Department of Defense.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:90%
It was truly just remarkable.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.217 align:middle line:90%
And it's been released.

00:04:08.217 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Why would you think
they would release

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.933 align:middle line:90%
what we're about to see?

00:04:10.933 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, this
is interesting,

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.330 align:middle line:84%
because these videos that are in
the public domain of Navy jets

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.130 align:middle line:90%
chasing--

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never I'd see this.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.829 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:90%
You hear the stories.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
But you think, well,
that sort of thing

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:84%
will never be
officially confirmed.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
The videos have been in the
public domain for a while.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But the US Department
of Defense itself

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
put them on their
own website and said,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:84%
we are confirming
that, previous,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:90%
it was unauthorized release.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But now, we're
making it official.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
let's look at this,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.530 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the
Department of Defense

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:90%
that supplied this video.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
looking at here, Nick?

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: What we're seeing
is a pilot's eye view.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is from
the plane of the pilot?

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: From the plane.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:10%
These are F-18
Super Hornets, one

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.998 align:middle line:10%
of the most advanced
naval jets in the world.

00:05:13.998 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Hundreds of
millions of dollars per jet.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.180 align:middle line:10%
And the pilots are
the best of the best.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.000 align:middle line:10%
I mean, these men and women
are literally the top guns.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:10%
And so what we're seeing is
forward-looking infrared camera

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:10%
video of these,
basically, objects

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:10%
that even the pilots have
no idea what they are.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:10%
They say the speeds and the
maneuvers are extraordinary.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:10%
This is born out not just by
their eyewitness testimony,

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:10%
but by the radar data as well.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are they trying
to catch this thing?

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they're
basically-- these are--

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:10%
I hasten.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:10%
I'm a little bit reluctant
to use the word dogfight,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:10%
but it is.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they're not
trying to shoot.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean, they
didn't fire on them.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.450 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: No, but
they're certainly

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:10%
trying to close on the
object to identify it.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:10%
And let's not forget.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:10%
These are incursions into
restricted military airspace,

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:10%
whether it's around the
aircraft carriers that

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:10%
have been involved.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.018 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then we saw
it zoom off, just whoosh.

00:06:15.018 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: And one of the pilots--

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:90%
he had a great quote.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I don't know what it
was, but I want to fly one."

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.495 align:middle line:84%
When a top gun
tells you that, you

00:06:22.495 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
know that you're dealing with
some pretty impressive speeds

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:90%
and maneuvers.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
some real concern

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that these might be
Russian or Chinese?

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yes, and
it's interesting.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
The acting chair of the
Senate Intelligence Committee,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Marco Rubio, has said
on this very point.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's an extraordinary
bombshell quote.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:84%
You would never think that
somebody in that position

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:90%
would say this.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I would
almost rather we

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:84%
were dealing with
something off planet

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.515 align:middle line:84%
than the Russians
or the Chinese."

00:07:00.515 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's scary to
think our enemies have that.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, we are not
comfortable with the position

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that an adversary might have
made a technological leap

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:90%
of that nature.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:90%
So I'd rather it was off planet.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm not quite so sure.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Because at least with the
Russians and the Chinese,

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.360 align:middle line:90%
you've got a handle.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:84%
They may be adversaries,
but you can talk to them.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:84%
If this is really
from off planet,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
we have no idea what they
are or what they want.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And we have no idea,
really, how to talk to them.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So I found it a
surprising statement.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that the chair
of the Senate Armed Services

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Committee-- or pardon me.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the chair of the
Senate Intelligence Committee

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:84%
is making a statement like that
and saying quite openly, well,

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather it was off
planet, is extraordinary

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
when you think of where we
were just a few months ago.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.047 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When you were at the
British Ministry of Defence,

00:07:59.047 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:10%
Nick, do you think pilots from
Britain went through the same

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:10%
thing that our Navy pilots did?

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes, absolutely.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And I know that because I've
spoken to a lot of them.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And what we didn't have--

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had some
old gun camera footage

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:90%
from the '50s, the '60s.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Really old.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Grainy.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Grainy.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't really tell much.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.790 align:middle line:84%
What we didn't have was this
modern, sophisticated stuff

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
that you're getting with the US
Navy now, where you know that,

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:84%
as well as just looking at it,
you can run all sorts of tests

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:90%
with the telemetry.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.500 align:middle line:90%
So these people came to me.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.929 align:middle line:84%
And they said, Nick,
we've seen these things.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:90%
We've chased them.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:90%
They run rings around us.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.930 align:middle line:84%
But they were reluctant
to go on the record,

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't have that
forward-looking infrared camera

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:90%
footage that--

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But now, we do.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Now we do.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now, we do.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if some of the pilots
from years gone back would say,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
after looking at this video,
that's exactly what I saw?

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I've heard almost
exactly that phrase.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard a
lot of pilots say

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
this is a vindication
of everything

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
that I saw and talked about,
maybe just in the crew room.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.540 align:middle line:90%
And people maybe laughed at me.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.725 align:middle line:84%
But now, they're not
laughing anymore.

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
make an assumption

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:90%
that these are extraterrestrial.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
They've been here since
the beginning of time,

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:90%
haven't they?

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:90%
This isn't new.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.040 align:middle line:84%
The new part is that
we've got it on video.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Pentagon is admitting,
we don't know what these are.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But these objects have been
here for, how many years?

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Since the dawn of time.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, absolutely.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.457 align:middle line:84%
And we say in relation
to that, I suppose, well,

00:09:45.457 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
if they wanted to wipe us out,
they would have done it by now.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Or if this was an
alien invasion,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:90%
it would have happened by now.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're forced to look at other
more imaginative possibilities.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:90%
And this is good, I think.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Because what it seems
to me, closest to--

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is a scientific,
anthropological interaction.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And again, people would
say, why don't they

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.833 align:middle line:90%
land on the White House lawn?

00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe we're
getting close to that.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
we're being observed,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:84%
the idea that as a newly
emerging civilization,

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:84%
we might be of interest, but
in an anthropological way.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So they're not coming
here to steal our gold

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:90%
or take all the water.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they
would have done that.

00:10:30.883 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Exactly.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But societies might
interest them.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Our political structures,
our religions,

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:84%
our philosophical beliefs,
our personal paradigms

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.552 align:middle line:84%
and worldviews-- those sorts
of more abstract concepts.

00:10:47.552 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- yeah, we're not
going to have anything

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
to teach them about science
and technology, obviously.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But those abstract concepts,
whether it's art, literature,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:90%
poetry, architecture.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I'm
convinced they seeded us.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming back
to watch their offspring,

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
how we're developing, how we're
growing, how we're turning.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think they did this to
us in the beginning of time.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:90%
They may be our gods.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, who are their gods?

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Probably "the God."

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.247 align:middle line:90%
But I think they seeded us.

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, that raises
an interesting question.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously,
we don't know answers

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:84%
to some fairly fundamental
questions like,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:84%
what position does altruism
have in the universe?

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that our
creators, the ancient gods,

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:84%
whatever we term these
things, are coming back,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.630 align:middle line:84%
poses the question, what
are they going to think of?

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:90%
How we've-- don't--

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say,
we made a mistake.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So are they coming
back to watch?

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.038 align:middle line:84%
Or are they coming back to say,
hey, people, what the heck?

00:11:55.038 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's going on?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And I'm joking
about it, but not.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if that
is the situation,

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
then maybe some correctional
action is going to be taken.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.560 align:middle line:90%
And what does that entail?

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:90%
That is exactly right.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Nick, the Senate
Intelligence Committee

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:84%
has some legislation
that they're considering,

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:90%
which calls for action on UFOs.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: An absolutely
extraordinary development.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:84%
The Intelligence Authorization
Act for fiscal year 2021

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
has, in parallel
with all the sorts

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:84%
of usual things about Russia and
China, and the insider threat,

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and Iran, and nuclear issues--

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.330 align:middle line:84%
there's a section on
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:10%
And they basically
say something serious

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:10%
is going on in our airspace.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:10%
We have multiple incursions into
restricted military airspace,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.825 align:middle line:10%
whether it's over bases
or in the vicinity of--

00:13:01.825 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Missile silos
all over the place.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And around these very
powerful Navy carrier

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:17.628 align:middle line:84%
groups, the "Nimitz," of course,
the famous incident from 2004.

00:13:17.628 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
Tic Tac evidence.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: That's the Tic Tac.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Intelligence
Committee has basically

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
said, we require from
the Director of National

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence, in consultation
with the Secretary

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
of Defense, a full report
into what's going on.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:84%
We are not happy with the
fragmented information

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:90%
that we have--

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:84%
different parts of the
intelligence community

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:84%
doing different things,
nobody putting the big picture

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:90%
We want to know what's going on.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:84%
We want a report within 180
days of this bill being enacted.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
We want it unclassified,
but possibly

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:90%
with a classified appendix.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:90%
So, unprecedented.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.425 align:middle line:84%
I mean, normally these sorts
of-- the senators who run--

00:14:10.425 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not this dramatic.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: --this committee-- they
don't touch this issue at all.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:90%
It's toxic.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're saying
things are getting so serious.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:84%
We want DNI and SecDef to do a
proper intelligence assessment.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
expect to be this close

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:84%
with videos, government
intervention, and things

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I don't
know, but this is.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting point.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.248 align:middle line:84%
We are as close as
we've ever been.

00:14:39.248 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ever, for disclosure--

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It's touching distance.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --and everything else.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.615 align:middle line:84%
You could reach
out and touch it.

00:14:44.615 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems to me, though,
that the right hand doesn't

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
know what the left
hand is doing.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Why would the Senate
be investigating,

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to get information
about UFOs if you and I know?

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:84%
We already know
about this stuff.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't that agency that
may be responsible for this

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.060 align:middle line:90%
telling them right now?

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:90%
Hey, let's come into this room.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:90%
We want to tell you something.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:90%
That's not happening.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.515 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:15:10.515 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I
think you can say

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that that's an issue
not just with UFOs,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
but many, many different
things, particularly when you

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.843 align:middle line:90%
get to the highly classified.

00:15:19.843 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Secrecy every door.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yeah, deeply
compartmentalized.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is, absolutely.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I lived in that world,
worked in it for 21 years.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:90%
It's always the way of things.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Not just with UFOs, but nuclear
issues, intelligence matters.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.770 align:middle line:84%
The other interesting
point is, I

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:84%
don't want to say there's a
dogfight over this in Congress.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yet.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But it is interesting
that both the Armed Services

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Committee and the
Intelligence Committee

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.660 align:middle line:90%
are both interested in this.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, normally, there
would be one clear lead.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not clear who's
leading on that.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And that does make me
wonder whether there isn't

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
behind-the-scenes tension

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:84%
over who's going to be
actually running this.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might they be
doing it for show, Nick,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:84%
just to trick the
American public that we're

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.830 align:middle line:84%
interested in trying to
find out what this is?

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.412 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's going
to sit there forever.

00:16:18.412 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, it might.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think that would pose
the question-- to what end?

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean,
normally governments

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:90%
don't touch this issue at all.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.000 align:middle line:90%
As I say, it's--

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At least publicly.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: At least publicly.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Because it's toxic--
the ridicule factor.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:90%
That's changing.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now, the president
is talking about this.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:84%
The senators are
talking about this.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.917 align:middle line:84%
The pilots are talking about
it, the radar operators,

00:16:42.917 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:90%
the intelligence officers.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.833 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: So maybe we're
in new territory.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you feel vindicated?

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.792 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you've
stuck your neck out

00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:90%
in the news for a long time.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I think I was
luckier than most.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Having done this
for the government,

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I was always less likely to
have people ridiculing me.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course,
I could always

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:84%
point to declassified files
from the British government

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:90%
that talked about this.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.678 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the UFO
community, more generally

00:17:10.678 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:84%
people that didn't do
it within government,

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
but as a private interest--
they are utterly vindicated

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:90%
by what's going on right now.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This act
seems to be centered

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.980 align:middle line:90%
around some kind of threat.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Did you pick that up?

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:90%
It's clever.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:90%
It's very clever.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
we're dealing with.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, we have no idea.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But they've
cleverly wrapped it up

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:84%
in the threat narrative, I
think, for a couple of reasons.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, you might be criticized
for taking an interest in UFOs.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But you won't be
criticized for being

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:84%
concerned about the integrity
of United States airspace.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:90%
You won't be--

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And safety.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Exactly.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:90%
You play it correctly.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:84%
You play it as a defense
and national security issue,

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and everyone is like, right,
we're on side with that.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.650 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, of
course, is resources.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.950 align:middle line:84%
If you talk about a threat
to the defense of the United

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:84%
States and then you say,
well, should we just

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
ignore that threat
or deal with it?

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.785 align:middle line:90%
People will say deal with it.

00:18:17.785 --> 00:18:18.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's going to--

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here's more money.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.403 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Here's more money.

00:18:20.403 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's cleverly done, I think.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's a nice, smart play.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a ruse?

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It's not a ruse.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Because in one sense,
I absolutely get it.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:90%
It sounds a little bit bizarre.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:84%
But in the military and
the intelligence community,

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:84%
there is an equation
that defines threat.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's capability
times intent.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.180 align:middle line:90%
We know the capability.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty darned impressive.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea
about the intent.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we can't say if
there's a threat or not.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And if we can't say
whether there's a threat,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:90%
we can't rule it out.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's worrying.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Years ago,
Steven Greer, who's

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
been investigating UFOs,
former emergency room doctor,

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.780 align:middle line:84%
devoted his entire
career now to ufology,

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
did some mock hearings
on, what would it

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:84%
be like if Congress started
to investigate UFOs?

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we're going to
really get to this possibility

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
where we'll have real
congressional hearings

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:90%
about this?

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I think we will.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, there have been some real
congressional hearings before,

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
but back in the
'60s, before we were

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:90%
in this modern high-tech world.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
What we have now that
we never had before

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:84%
is data, whether it's satellite
imagery that could pick up

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:84%
your water cup from
orbit or whether it's

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
measurement and signals,
signature intelligence that

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.380 align:middle line:84%
can discern all sorts of
things about an object.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Just from looking at those
forward-looking infrared camera

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.850 align:middle line:84%
videos, you could probably tell
us something about the energy

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:90%
source--

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.313 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: --the propulsion system.

00:20:11.313 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which
we'd love to know.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: We'd love
to know not just out

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.380 align:middle line:10%
of the pursuit of
knowledge, though that would

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.005 align:middle line:10%
be interesting in its own right,
but because we want that tech

00:20:22.005 --> 00:20:22.805 align:middle line:10%
ourselves.

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.780 align:middle line:84%
We want to reverse engineer
it and do it ourselves.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we already have.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Maybe.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And the other point
is that we want

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle line:84%
that before the Chinese or the
Russians get their hands on it.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's a good
point, because somebody will.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Germans were very
close to having technology way

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:90%
before us.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Weren't they?

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, the Germans
in many senses had--

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had the first
operational jet fighter,

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:90%
the Me 262.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:84%
They had effectively the world's
first ballistic missiles.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the V1.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The V2s?

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: The V2, particularly.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Had those been produced
just a little bit earlier,

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
before the Allied bombing
campaign flattened

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.283 align:middle line:84%
the factories and
the launch sites,

00:21:13.283 --> 00:21:14.450 align:middle line:90%
they could have won the war.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:15.283 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:21:15.283 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
They came close to
the atomic bomb.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Werner Heisenberg was
so close having it.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: There was
that very famous--

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.880 align:middle line:84%
not as widely known
as it should be,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.380 align:middle line:84%
because it was a
real turning point.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.410 align:middle line:84%
But that famous commando
raid on the heavy water plant

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:90%
in Norway--

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: --that had that raid
not succeeded, who knows?

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We lucked
out there, maybe.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe we didn't.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.285 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we knew.

00:21:39.285 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I don't know.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.118 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe we knew.

00:21:41.118 --> 00:21:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But It's
amazing how sometimes

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:84%
the fate of the entire
world seems to just turn

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:90%
on the tiniest point.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:90%
And that may be the true--

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:90%
with the UFO phenomenon, too.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Hence, these
congressional hearings.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And to go back to your question,
yes, I think we may get them.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And we may get them in
this era of big data

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and artificial intelligence.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And we can do so much
more with the information

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.820 align:middle line:84%
than we could do
back in the '60s.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an exciting
time in the field of ufology,

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: It is the most exciting
time in the 70-plus years

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:90%
of this modern mystery.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, it feels
like almost literally

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
every week, some new story,
some new development.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily just
a sighting, but I'm

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.990 align:middle line:84%
talking now about the
congressional interest,

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:45.170 align:middle line:84%
the statements that are coming
from the president, even.

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
The more and more pilots
and radar operators

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:84%
coming forward,
going on the record.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.360 align:middle line:84%
What's happening-- it's like
there have been the floodgates.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:90%
But now, they're opening.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:84%
When one pilot comes forward
on the record, even some people

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.520 align:middle line:90%
still in the service--

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.240 align:middle line:84%
others say, well, heck, if
they're going to say it,

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say it.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Nick, Rear
Admiral Thomas Wilson

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:10%
has documents, they claim, that
purport to be all about UFOs.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Richard Dolan, ufologist,
believes they're authentic.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, this is
a fascinating story--

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:84%
15 pages of notes purporting
to relate to a meeting that

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:37.010 align:middle line:84%
took place in 2002,
round and about,

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
involving former Defense
Intelligence Agency head

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Thomas Wilson
and Eric Davis,

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.220 align:middle line:84%
who had been involved in
the National Institute

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.900 align:middle line:84%
for Discovery Science,
which was an early Bigelow--

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: NIDS.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: --think tank.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.447 align:middle line:10%
And Edgar Mitchell
was involved--

00:23:57.447 --> 00:23:58.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Apollo 14--

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: --in some of this.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --late astronaut.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Mitchell had almost
been the facilitator of this.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who wouldn't
want to attend

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.277 align:middle line:90%
a meeting with a genuine hero?

00:24:11.277 --> 00:24:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Sixth man to walk--

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.978 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: --on the moon.

00:24:13.978 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
loved Edgar Mitchell.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was a great guy.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I met him
a couple of times.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Wonderful man, very interesting
on all sorts of levels.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But he set up some
of these meetings.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And these notes purport
to basically run

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:38.750 align:middle line:84%
through almost the origin
story of the modern UFO

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:42.380 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon from UFO crash,
possibly at Roswell,

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.850 align:middle line:84%
through to the attempt to
reverse engineer something.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And if these notes
are genuine, it

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:55.880 align:middle line:84%
would seem to confirm almost
every previously regarded as

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.220 align:middle line:84%
far-fetched claim
about all this.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.407 align:middle line:84%
And I have people saying,
maybe it's real after all.

00:25:01.407 --> 00:25:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got something
from "Strange Tales

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Weekly" about these
documents and some

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.583 align:middle line:90%
of the players involved.

00:25:08.583 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JESS ROGGE: Before you
start reading this document

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:84%
or getting into it, you want
to know who the players are.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:10%
The Wilson documents are named
after Admiral Thomas Wilson.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:10%
Admiral Wilson had a
long career in the Navy.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:23.560 align:middle line:10%
He worked as Director of Defense
for the Intelligence Agency,

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:10%
Director of Intelligence for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:10%
and Deputy Director
of Intelligence

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:10%
for the Joint Chiefs.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:10%
And he met with Dr. Eric
Davis, an astrophysicist who

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:10%
worked in the National Institute
for Discovery of the Sciences,

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.870 align:middle line:10%
also known as NIDS.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:10%
NIDS was funded by Robert
Bigelow of Bigelow Aerospace.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.790 align:middle line:10%
And NIDS was responsible
for scientific research

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:10%
in all areas of UFO, including
investigating the Skinwalker

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:10%
Ranch in Utah in which
Davis was involved.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:10%
And now, Eric Davis
is currently working

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:10%
with EarthTech which was
started by Harold Puthoff, which

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:10%
is a company that is contracted
to work with the To the Stars

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:10%
Academy.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:10%
What's a neat little
fact here, too,

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:10%
is Puthoff and Davis worked
on the remote viewing

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:10%
protocols for the
government back in the '70s.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, many of the
players you just mentioned,

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Nick.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: You could
draw a diagram.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And the same names pop
up again and again.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
interesting about this--

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and this is a story that
I know that "The New York

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Times" is interested in.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, they sure are.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And "The Times" broke the
"Nimitz" story, didn't they?

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: They did.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, Tic Tac story.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I've written
for "The Times."

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.287 align:middle line:84%
I know how vigorous
their fact checking is.

00:26:42.287 --> 00:26:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:43.715 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I mean, it's brutal.

00:26:43.715 --> 00:26:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It's brutal.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.503 align:middle line:84%
So they have to
be absolutely sure

00:26:47.503 --> 00:26:48.670 align:middle line:90%
before they print something.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They won't
publish fluff.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So they're interested in
this Wilson document story.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:03.760 align:middle line:84%
A number of other very serious
players are interested in this.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Previously, Admiral Wilson
had said, effectively,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:90%
no comment on this.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:16.520 align:middle line:84%
But possibly in an
attempt to kill the story,

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.730 align:middle line:84%
there's been a
more recent denial.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.770 align:middle line:90%
But I mean, it's fascinating.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the interesting
phrases in these documents

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:90%
is the phrase--

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:90%
core secrets.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:33.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this again gets
to the heart of, I guess,

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:90%
the whole origin story of UFOs.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, something like,
where is this being run out of,

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.360 align:middle line:90%
is a core secret.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And it seems,
trying to draw the--

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:84%
join the dots here, it seems
that it's no longer, if it ever

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.970 align:middle line:84%
was, run from within
government, but run out

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:56.170 align:middle line:90%
of the private sector.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is Admiral
Wilson saying about this?

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the guy is in his '70s.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.998 align:middle line:84%
Is he admitting that
these are his documents?

00:28:03.998 --> 00:28:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, it's interesting.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Because previously, his
line was no comment.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But when he became
aware that there

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:84%
was some very serious mainstream
media interest in this,

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:21.490 align:middle line:84%
he quickly moved to issue
an absolute denial on this.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting,
because the notes themselves

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:28.060 align:middle line:84%
say somewhere, if
this ever comes out--

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Deny.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I am going
to be denying this.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:90%
And these are notes which--

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:84%
the suspicion is that Eric
Davis wrote up these notes

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:90%
after a meeting--

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the admiral.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: --with the admiral.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But Davis himself has neither
confirmed nor denied this.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, probably
because two reasons.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, a non-disclosure
agreement of some sort.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: With Bigelow
Aerospace who,

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.930 align:middle line:84%
of course, had the AATIP
contract from the US government

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:06.730 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.490 align:middle line:84%
That was a multi-million
dollar deal, wasn't it?

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.905 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yeah, $22 million
that we know about.

00:29:11.905 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That Harry
Reid put together.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yeah, but the other
reason why he won't talk about

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and I completely agree
with him on this.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:24.130 align:middle line:90%
The law is very strict on this.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.777 align:middle line:84%
If you start talking
about classified--

00:29:26.777 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classified.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: --documents or matters--

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He may be
violating his oath.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Exactly.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And even if you are not the
one who has leaked something,

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:43.450 align:middle line:84%
if knowing it to be genuine and
knowing that it's classified,

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:44.980 align:middle line:90%
you start talking about it.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.820 align:middle line:84%
You yourself are
breaking the law,

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:90%
even if you didn't leak it.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: So I get why
he's being careful.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But, deny, deny, deny?

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Why doesn't he just
say, I can't comment?

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I think he's
trying to kill the story.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is interesting
in and of itself.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is anybody getting
to this guy, this admiral?

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yes, one or two
people have spoken to him.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I think a journalist called
Billy Cox got through to him.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And the admiral said,
if I met Eric Davis,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember him.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, basically
denying everything.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But there's no middle ground
with something like this.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:36.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't get into a car and
have a two-hour conversation

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.390 align:middle line:84%
with someone about
crashed UFOs and reverse

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.870 align:middle line:84%
engineering alien technology
and then forget about it.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's binary.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Either it happened or it didn't.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:84%
But you don't do something
like that and then forget it.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:50.450 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a fascinating
story, though.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost
as incredible

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.680 align:middle line:90%
as the Majestic 12 documents.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, the
Majestic 12 story

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
is part, really, of
this core secret.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And people have said, who
is keeping this secret?

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And in these Wilson documents,
the phrase is used--

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I think-- the gatekeepers,
a group of actually not 12

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.710 align:middle line:90%
people, but 3 who--

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:24.870 align:middle line:84%
the story is that Wilson himself
tried to get access to this

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and said, look, as a
former head of the DIA,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.870 align:middle line:90%
I should be read in on this.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And three people basically
met with him and said,

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:84%
no, you're not
going on the list.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.300 align:middle line:90%
You're not cleared for this.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.308 align:middle line:84%
And he was apparently
furious and said--

00:31:39.308 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As he should be.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Don't you know who I am?

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:84%
This is completely
in my ball park.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
we'll think about it.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And they got back to him
and said, no, it's not.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Past presidents have
been fascinated with ufology.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Ronald Reagan was.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:90%
Jimmy Carter was.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Richard Nixon was.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.170 align:middle line:84%
We hear about the
story where he took

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Jackie Gleason, the comedian,
to Homestead Air Force base

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:09.248 align:middle line:84%
in Florida and showed him aliens
that they had in glass cases.

00:32:09.248 --> 00:32:10.290 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible story.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Clark McClelland has
written about that.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of presidents have
been interested in UFOs.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Where does our current
president stand on that?

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:20.646 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:32:20.646 --> 00:32:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Yes, he's made some of
the most provocative statements

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.990 align:middle line:84%
about this that I've ever
heard a president make.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But you have to pick
through them carefully,

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:84%
because he starts
off very cautious.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, I'm
skeptical about this.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.898 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he doesn't
know anything, does he?

00:32:37.898 --> 00:32:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, we don't know.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
they tell presidents.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I'm not so sure.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.210 align:middle line:84%
His first statement
was very interesting.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:49.860 align:middle line:84%
He started off, as
I say, by saying,

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.540 align:middle line:84%
I am a little bit
skeptical about this.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't tend to believe it.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But then he said, our very
fine pilots see these things.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And that does seem
to be something

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.860 align:middle line:84%
a little bit different this
time around, and we're watching.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Then later, he was doing a
briefing with Reuters, I think.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And they were covering
a whole bunch of things.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:90%
And I think China came up.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of it,
they got on to the fact

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.130 align:middle line:84%
that the Pentagon had
just themselves released

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.260 align:middle line:90%
those three videos.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And President Trump said
words to the effect of,

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.730 align:middle line:84%
that's one heck of
a video, isn't it?

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:36.690 align:middle line:90%
And I wonder, could it be real?

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:38.770 align:middle line:90%
And he left that remark hanging.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And then he did a Father's
Day interview with his own son

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:48.010 align:middle line:90%
on his son's YouTube channel.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And he started dropping hints
about Roswell and Area 51.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And he basically said,
yeah, I know some things,

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not really
at liberty to say.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And then his son
said to him, well,

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.090 align:middle line:84%
do you think you might
declassify any of this?

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'll have
to think about that.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Barack Obama was on
some late night television

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.659 align:middle line:10%
talk shows during
his presidency.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And he was asked about
UFOs, and he didn't deny it.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.909 align:middle line:84%
Laughed about it, but
he didn't deny it.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But that's interesting,
because Barack Obama has

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.690 align:middle line:90%
been on those sorts of shows--

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.290 align:middle line:84%
"Jimmy Kimmel," I think,
and maybe some others.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Bill Clinton.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.980 align:middle line:90%
And they always joke about it.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.130 align:middle line:84%
The really interesting
thing about Trump

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:42.100 align:middle line:84%
is that even when he's
sounding skeptical about this,

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.130 align:middle line:90%
he isn't joking about it.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.429 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:48.520 align:middle line:84%
On the Gaia "Deep
Space" program,

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.730 align:middle line:84%
they explored the late
John F. Kennedy's interest

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:57.620 align:middle line:84%
in UFOs and some of the blocks
against him that he was facing.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.710 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE BARA: I look at
Kennedy's public attempt to go

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.470 align:middle line:10%
to the moon, the Apollo
program that he devised--

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Altitude 1,400 feet,
still looking very good.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.830 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE BARA: --what I see is a
president who came into power,

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.950 align:middle line:10%
knowing about aliens,
knowing about UFOs,

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:10%
wanting to find out
more, found himself

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.910 align:middle line:10%
blocked by the national
security state--

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.468 align:middle line:10%
the CIA, the NSA,
Majestic 12, and said,

00:35:20.468 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:10%
OK, you guys aren't going to
tell me what you're doing.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.520 align:middle line:10%
You're not going to tell
me what you're up to.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:24.950 align:middle line:90%
"F" you.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.270 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm going to do?

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to create my own
public space program which

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:31.340 align:middle line:84%
is going to have a
secret purpose, which

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:84%
is going to go to the moon and
retrieve the technology that we

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.020 align:middle line:90%
know is there.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to build
our own secret space fleet.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:42.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Man and his quest for
knowledge and progress is

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.830 align:middle line:10%
determined and
cannot be deterred.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.830 align:middle line:10%
The exploration of
space will go ahead.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.590 align:middle line:90%
We chose to go to the moon.

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:53.110 align:middle line:90%
We chose to go to the moon.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.601 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:54.601 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.430 align:middle line:10%
We choose to go to the
moon in this decade

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:05.980 align:middle line:10%
and do the other things,
not because they are easy,

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.330 align:middle line:10%
but because they are hard.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.821 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:08.821 --> 00:36:12.018 align:middle line:90%


00:36:12.018 --> 00:36:13.560 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a really
interesting memo.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.090 align:middle line:10%
It's called the burned memo.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:10%
And in the burned memo,
there's a sentence

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.045 align:middle line:10%
that's very, very chilling.

00:36:18.045 --> 00:36:21.840 align:middle line:10%
It says, "Of course, Lancer
has been inquiring about

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.110 align:middle line:10%
our activities, which is
something we cannot allow."

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.063 align:middle line:10%
Lancer was JFK's Secret
Service nickname.

00:36:28.063 --> 00:36:29.730 align:middle line:10%
So what they're saying
there, basically,

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:10%
is that JFK is trying to ask us
about what our activities are,

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.120 align:middle line:10%
which involve aliens and UFOs.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.260 align:middle line:10%
And we cannot allow this.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.330 align:middle line:10%
When they say, we cannot allow,
that implies they're going

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.295 align:middle line:10%
to do something about it.

00:36:42.295 --> 00:36:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
always been talk

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:47.930 align:middle line:84%
that Marilyn Monroe knew
secrets from JFK as well

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:50.606 align:middle line:84%
and was going to
talk about UFOs.

00:36:50.606 --> 00:36:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Sure, and
made people believe

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.660 align:middle line:84%
that there was a little bit
of pillow talk, shall we say?

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe a
lot of pillow talk.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: A lot of pillow
talk that she, therefore,

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:06.050 align:middle line:84%
somehow knew about
it, knew the secret

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:10.533 align:middle line:84%
and was bumped off and
then same with JFK.

00:37:10.533 --> 00:37:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Same thing
tragically happened, yeah.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Now, I don't
know about this.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's not
my area of expertise.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's maybe
unknowable these days.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.105 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I don't know.

00:37:23.105 --> 00:37:27.200 align:middle line:84%
But some people say, do
you think presidents know?

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And I disagree with
a lot of people.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I get that a lot of people say,
well, maybe some presidents

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:34.040 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Maybe no presidents know.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.810 align:middle line:90%
I disagree.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.347 align:middle line:84%
I think every president
would have to know.

00:37:39.347 --> 00:37:40.430 align:middle line:90%
The reason I say that is--

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:41.847 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
you say that.

00:37:41.847 --> 00:37:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I say it because
of the president's position

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.120 align:middle line:90%
as commander in chief.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the UK, we call it
the culture of no surprises

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And what we mean is that
on any big strategic issue,

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:59.930 align:middle line:84%
leadership always
has to be briefed.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Because what you couldn't
have is a situation where

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:05.120 align:middle line:84%
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
comes running into the Oval

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Office and says, Mr President,
the situation with the aliens

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.040 align:middle line:90%
has turned sour.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.630 align:middle line:90%
We need to take action.

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And the president looks
blank and says, what aliens?

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or what action?

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: What action.

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So if there is an
extraterrestrial presence,

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:26.480 align:middle line:84%
it's my firm belief that
every president of every party

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.880 align:middle line:84%
would have to be
briefed on day one.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they might have
to take the biggest

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.440 align:middle line:84%
single strategic decision
that any president

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.060 align:middle line:90%
would ever have to take.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.852 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the movie
"Independence Day."

00:38:39.852 --> 00:38:40.652 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Exactly.

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
truly anything we

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:47.160 align:middle line:84%
could do if we were being
invaded by extraterrestrials?

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Probably not.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:52.530 align:middle line:84%
But then you get into a
rather interesting theory

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.410 align:middle line:90%
of warfare idea.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is if you figure
out what the motive is,

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.420 align:middle line:90%
what is it they want?

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.690 align:middle line:90%
If you can then destroy that--

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "It's a cookbook."

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah, "it's a cookbook."

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remember that?

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes, I do.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They want to eat us.

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I do.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you can destroy
a thing and put it

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.890 align:middle line:84%
beyond the reach of the
enemy, even if that enemy

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.420 align:middle line:84%
is orders of magnitude above
and beyond anything you can do,

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.810 align:middle line:90%
suddenly you have the whip hand.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying or
advocating if there's

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:84%
a extraterrestrial presence
and if it's not entirely benign

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.610 align:middle line:84%
that we should get into a
shooting war with these people.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But we should try
and figure out what

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.280 align:middle line:90%
their strategic intentions are.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And if it revolves--
if it does--

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I say that
they're not here

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to steal our gold or our
water, but they want something.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe they want us.

00:39:51.955 --> 00:39:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Maybe they want us.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.788 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how
many stories have we

00:39:54.788 --> 00:39:57.020 align:middle line:90%
heard about alien abductions?

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: A lot.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Although, interestingly,
tying it back

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:84%
to the Wilson documents,
there's a line in there

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:84%
somewhere that it says UFOs
real, abductions not happening.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Say that to the
millions of people that

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:13.960 align:middle line:90%
claim to have been abducted.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: I know.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, there's an
intriguing possibility here.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:22.690 align:middle line:84%
If the Wilson
documents are genuine,

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:26.930 align:middle line:84%
then some of the information may
nonetheless be disinformation.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: So every time you
get into this shadowy world

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:36.670 align:middle line:10%

it's all smoke and mirrors

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.977 align:middle line:10%
and plans within plans

00:40:38.977 --> 00:40:40.810 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Nick, keep
doing what you're doing.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.460 align:middle line:10%
What drives you?

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.050 align:middle line:10%
What are you looking for?

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.490 align:middle line:10%
>>POPE: I'm looking for answers.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm looking for answers
to one of the biggest

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.250 align:middle line:10%
and most interesting
questions we can ask.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:55.210 align:middle line:10%
And I feel that we might
be as close to that answer

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.340 align:middle line:10%
as we've ever been.

beyond our own planet.

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Is it conceivable?

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible we
are being visited?

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.
