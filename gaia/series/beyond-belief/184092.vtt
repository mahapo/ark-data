00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:26.520 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.620 align:middle line:10%
A very special friend
and guest for you

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.300 align:middle line:10%
today, Catherine Austin Fitts.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Catherine has served as a
managing director and a member

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:84%
of the board of directors of
the Wall Street investment firm

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Dillon, Read & Company.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.190 align:middle line:10%
She has also been an
assistant secretary of housing

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:10%
and has served in the
first Bush administration.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Now she offers her Solari
Report to subscribers like you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:84%
in a very unique
perspective on how

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:84%
to navigate the
opportunities and risks

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:84%
of the global financial
system and political economy.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Catherine, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CATHERINE AUSTIN
FITTS: Thank you, George.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:84%
It's always a pleasure
to be with you.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have provided
us on "Coast to Coast"

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:84%
primarily some of the
greatest kinds of information.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:90%
How do you do it all the time?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I'm a great example of
your audience, curious people,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.420 align:middle line:90%
independent minded.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
They like to look
under the carpet.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:90%
They like to look into things.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And it started me on a
journey of helping people,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and I get questions why is
this way, always about money.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:84%
It was really funny, I was very
opposed to really understanding

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
space, and understand
that a lot of what's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:84%
happening here on the
planet is controlled

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:90%
from the orbital platforms.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.458 align:middle line:84%
So you opened my eyes to a whole
part of the planetary balance

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:90%
sheet that I hadn't understood.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you've opened
our minds to a lot of things

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:84%
For example, what we're going
to be talking about today,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
$21 trillion missing
from government.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, we're not
talking about chump change

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.222 align:middle line:84%
here. $21 trillion
over how long a period

00:01:56.222 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:90%
has this been going on?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: That is at two
agencies, Department

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
of Defense and HUD, from
fiscal 1998 to 2015.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:84%
It is a long period and it was
a period of explosive growth

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
and globalization, where the
United States was essentially

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
the leader of the entire
global financial system.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:90%
Now is it transit dollars?

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:90%
It's less than the bailouts.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So the bailouts, depending
on which estimate

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
you believe, as loans or
gifts of $24 to $29 trillion.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And you take the two
in total and you're

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:90%
talking $50 trillion.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you hide that
kind of money, Catherine?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: There are
many ways to hide

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:90%
that kind of money, George.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I wouldn't
have believed it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
if I hadn't lived
through the litigation

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:90%
with the federal government.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
But it requires enormous
control digitally

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:84%
of the financial and
information systems.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:84%
If anything,
globalization incurred

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
tremendous labor
deflation, which helped

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:90%
offset monetary inflation.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing is, when you
have very, very tight control

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
of the money, you can
basically ratchet down

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:84%
tremendous demand on Main Street
to the benefit of the insiders.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about inflation.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful website
called the Chapwood Index.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And according to
them, and this fits

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
with my personal experience
and that of my subscribers

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.322 align:middle line:84%
and clients, that
the cost of goods,

00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
the rise in the cost of goods
in America depending on where

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
you live, has run
from about 8% to 14%

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:90%
over the last five years.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
That's not hyperinflation, but
it's what I call the slow burn.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So if you look
at the people who have not

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
been able to keep up
with the cost of good,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:84%
they're basically getting slow
burned out of the middle class

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:90%
into poverty.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into poverty.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep, that's happening.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: And that's part--

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
the monetary inflation is part
of what has been doing that.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So that absolutely reflects
currency debasement.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of the
first revelations

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:84%
of this missing money came
really about a day before 9/11

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:84%
by Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Pentagon-- the
day before 9/11,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld declared war--

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:90%
not on foreign terrorists.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The adversary's
closer to home.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.800 align:middle line:10%
It's the Pentagon bureaucracy.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>> He said money wasted by
the military poses a serious

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:90%
threat.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, it could be said
that it's a matter of life

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:90%
and death.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Rumsfeld promised
change, but the next day,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:90%
the world changed.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go, let's go!

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the rush to
fund the War on Terrorism,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:84%
the war on waste seems
to have been forgotten.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:10%
>> My '03 budget calls for more
than $48 billion in new defense

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:10%
spending.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>> More money for the Pentagon,
when its own auditors admit

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
the military cannot account for
25% of what it already spends.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>> According to some estimates,
we cannot track $2.3 trillion

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:90%
in transactions.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> $2.3 trillion, with a T--

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:84%
that's $8,000 for every man,
woman, and child in America.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that was in 2001.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.548 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're at $21 trillion.

00:05:11.548 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, it's
very interesting.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I had been working
with a reporter

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:84%
at "InSight" magazine who,
for two years coming up

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to that press conference,
had published stories

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
about the money going
missing at HUD and DOD.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And we were more focused
on HUD, because I know--

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because you know it.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: --much more
about the HUD operations.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And she was about to
cover a huge cover

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.640 align:middle line:84%
story on the missing
money on the Friday

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.785 align:middle line:84%
following that
Rumsfeld's speech.

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So I remember
talking to her on Monday when

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:90%
the press conference happened.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And I assume Rumsfeld was doing
it to get ahead of the story,

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
because they all
knew it was coming.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
She'd been
interviewing everyone.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And I made the mistake of
saying to her, you know,

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:90%
nothing can stop this story now.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.892 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:55.892 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:90%
So I'll never say that again.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And look what happened.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look what happened.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When $1 comes into the
treasury, how do you hide it?

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Here's
the thing, George.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.487 align:middle line:84%
If you look at federal accounts
and financial statements,

00:06:10.487 --> 00:06:12.320 align:middle line:84%
it's a little bit like
"The Joy of Cooking."

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of recipes.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, if you want
to understand this issue,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:90%
you want to focus on examples.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let's start
off with the bailouts.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.475 align:middle line:84%
At the time of $24 to
$29 trillion of bailouts,

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
$8 trillion dollars
would have paid off

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:84%
all the single-family
mortgages in the country.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Done.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.680 align:middle line:90%
So whatever that--

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got free
debt-free houses.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: [LAUGHS] Whatever
that $24 trillion was about,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.830 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there
was very significant

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:84%
securities fraud involved
with the mortgage securities.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And certainly the
fact that the bailouts

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
were three times the outstanding
single-family mortgages

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:84%
would indicate that that
was probably the case.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:90%
So when $1 comes in--

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and remember, it can go into
an account in an agency,

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
or it can go into an
account in Treasury.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is that $1
doesn't go into Treasury.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
It goes into a bank account
at the New York Fed, which

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:90%
is depository for the Treasury.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's sitting
around somewhere.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's got it.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: In theory.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In theory.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: In theory.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So it can come in,
or it can go out.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.050 align:middle line:90%
And it can come in from taxes.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It can come in from sales and a
variety of other transactions.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.735 align:middle line:84%
Or it can come in from
selling treasury securities.

00:07:38.735 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So one of
the things we know

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:84%
about the undocumentable
adjustments-- we

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
know that there were
probably revenues in that.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So $21 trillion
is missing, or is

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
undocumented, but
that $21 trillion

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:90%
can be revenues and expenses.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So in theory, it could be $10
trillion in and $10 trillion

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.847 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And wouldn't you get
interest on the $21 trillion

00:07:58.847 --> 00:08:01.290 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in some bank?

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Only if that was
the terms and conditions

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:90%
of the account.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So we know, for
example, in Madoff--

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Madoff's had
extraordinary amounts

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
of cash balances sitting
in its bank, JP Morgan.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't appear that
they were earning much, if any,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:90%
interest.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Waste.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: No, not waste.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: $21 trillion dollars,
Catherine-- even if you got 3%,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.237 align:middle line:90%
you'd be making a lot of money.

00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, but
here's the thing, George.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at
what they're up to.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:90%
And this is just conjecture.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:84%
If I put $1 in a bank account
and part of my agreement

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm going to
leave that $1 there

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and you're free to use it,
then that's part of the deal.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you look at--

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.072 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the
scheme widens here.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Yeah, and I go back
to "The Joy of Cooking."

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds and
hundreds of recipes.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I came to believe that the
HUD accounts were probably

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
being used to launder
drug profits back.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You felt that.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I believe
that, and part of it

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.340 align:middle line:84%
was because of the
nature of the mortgage

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
fraud in the same neighborhoods
as the drugs were coming in.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Drug profits.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Right, so I go
back to Dillon Read here.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you talking about
illegal drugs or prescription

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:90%
drugs?

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Oh, I'm talking
about illegal drugs.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.115 align:middle line:84%
I would refer everybody
to "Dillon Read

00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:84%
& the Aristocracy
of Stock Profits."

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:90%
But there was--

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your book.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.898 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Yeah, there was
extraordinary patterns

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
of mortgage fraud in
South Central, LA,

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:84%
where the narcotics were coming
in during the "Dark Alliance"

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.527 align:middle line:90%
allegations.

00:09:33.527 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is horrible.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: [LAUGHS] So in
1998, Congress held hearings

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:84%
on the "Dark
Alliance" allegations,

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and I was helping a reporter
with the coverage of the story.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And she asked the spokesperson
for the Department

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:54.200 align:middle line:84%
of Justice questions
about what was going on.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And those spokesperson
had told her

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:84%
that the US economy at that
time launders $500 billion to $1

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:90%
trillion of all illegal moneys.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.146 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
narcotics trafficking.

00:10:04.146 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was giving a speech to
a wonderful group of people

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:84%
called Spiritual Frontiers
Foundation International,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and they talked about how they
can help evolve our society

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.397 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

00:10:17.397 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
middle of the speech,

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and I was explaining
what this person

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.372 align:middle line:84%
from the Department of
Justice had told the reporter.

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what
would happen if we

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
stopped being the global
leader in money laundering?

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.975 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: The audience-- we
had a little discussion.

00:10:30.975 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, you know, our
IRAs and 401(k)s would go down

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
because that money would leave
the New York Stock Exchange

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and go to Hong
Kong or Singapore.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.563 align:middle line:84%
And we'd have trouble financing
the government deficit

00:10:41.563 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
because we needed
to borrow money.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.687 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, well, let's pretend
there's a big red button up

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:90%
here in the lectern.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you push
that button, you can

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.238 align:middle line:84%
stop all hard
narcotics trafficking

00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:51.280 align:middle line:90%
in your city, your town--

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.088 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: --your state,
tomorrow, thus offending

00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:58.850 align:middle line:84%
the people who control $500
billion a year to $1 trillion

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:90%
a year of all dirty money.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So I said, who here
will push that button?

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And out of 100 people dedicated
to evolving our society

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, guess how
many would push the button?

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: None.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: One.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.972 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So I said
to the other, say,

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
99, why would you
not push the button?

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we don't want
our pension funds to go down.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.783 align:middle line:84%
We don't want our
government checks to stop--

00:11:20.783 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
think this is OK.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: --we don't
want our taxes-- well,

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
it's not that they
think it's OK.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:84%
What I discovered
that day was they

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.450 align:middle line:84%
felt a very strong conflict
between their fiduciary

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
obligation to their family
and doing the right thing

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:90%
for the whole.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And the problem, George,
was not that they

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.773 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't push the red button.

00:11:42.773 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:84%
The problem was
that they wouldn't

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:84%
go into the invention room
and say, well, how can we

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:90%
turn the red button green?

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:84%
How can we make money
pushing the red button?

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if we could make
money pushing the red button,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:54.810 align:middle line:90%
we could put--

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
so the problem was not that they
wouldn't push the red button.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
The problem was, we weren't
having an honest conversation.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.490 align:middle line:90%
And so you know me--

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I keep promoting transparency,
transparency, transparency.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons I met
you-- and I love the work

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:90%
that you've done.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to inspire
an honest conversation.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to
any of your shows,

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:84%
your attitude is, we're all
here to figure it out together.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying to
control the truth.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: You're not trying to
be guilty of material omissions.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.558 align:middle line:84%
So to a certain
extent, America is

00:12:29.558 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:84%
going to have to go
into the invention room

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and figure out how we
turn the red button green.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't
there supposed to be

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
accounting principle

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:90%
where they can see this money?

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's gone, and
somebody's supposed

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:90%
to report it to Congress?

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.763 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So we just
published a huge piece--

00:12:48.763 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I sent you a copy, we're putting
it in hard copy-- called,

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.530 align:middle line:84%
"The Real Game of
Missing Money,"--

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: --where we aggregate--

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.932 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well done, by the way.

00:12:54.932 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: Yeah, we
aggregate everything

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:10%
on the missing money, including
a series of seven briefing

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:10%
papers I've had some of
my attorneys write about

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.063 align:middle line:10%
how the law works.

00:13:04.063 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:90%
So here's how the law works.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to put it
in a simple nutshell.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
If you're interested
in the whole seven,

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:84%
it's all there in
its complete detail.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the government
is required to do two things.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Congress is required to approve
the money that's really spent.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed to spend
more than Congress agrees to.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.753 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: We can
borrow and spend more.

00:13:24.753 --> 00:13:27.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they give you
$100 limit, that's the limit.

00:13:27.045 --> 00:13:28.586 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: You're not
supposed to spend

00:13:28.586 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:90%
anything they haven't approved.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is you're
supposed to then report

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:90%
on what you spent.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So congress and the White House
approve, you spend, you report.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
we're spending money

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
that we're not appropriating
is what I believe,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're clearly
not disclosing it.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So we've had laws progressively
and rules progressively

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:84%
grown since the National
Security Act of 1947

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.095 align:middle line:90%
and the CIA Act of 1949.

00:13:58.095 --> 00:14:00.220 align:middle line:84%
We've made the money more
and more and more secret.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And now, we've had
a very new event.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.480 align:middle line:90%
And this is a very new event.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a material event, and
it's extremely important.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.697 align:middle line:84%
If you're a citizen,
if you're an investor,

00:14:10.697 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:84%
or if you're under the umbrella
of the global securities

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.430 align:middle line:84%
blanket of the United States,
this is very important.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a change in
accounting policy

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that, essentially, takes not
only the US government finance

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:84%
dark, but most of the US
securities market dark.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.648 align:middle line:90%
And so that's basically--

00:14:27.648 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's horrible.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well,
it's a coup d'etat.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a financial coup d'etat.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Essentially what
they've said is,

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.200 align:middle line:84%
we can make anything secret
we want by a secret process,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
by a secret group of
people, and you can't know.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's a complete
one-way mirror.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:84%
The NSA can watch your
smartphone, look into your TV,

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.290 align:middle line:90%
look into--

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're living
in "The Truman Show."

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And not only that--
we can borrow money

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:90%
from your pension funds.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:90%
We can tax you.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anytime
they want, anytime.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Not anytime
they want-- the pension

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.420 align:middle line:84%
fund trustees have to
agree to the process.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.415 align:middle line:90%
But basically--

00:15:03.415 --> 00:15:06.693 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, apparently,
they're all bought off.

00:15:06.693 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, I don't think
everybody's bought off.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:84%
But I always say
to people, look,

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:84%
this is not hopeless
at all, because you

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.238 align:middle line:84%
pay an enormous
number of people--

00:15:15.238 --> 00:15:17.530 align:middle line:84%
whether it's your pension
funds, your banks, your money

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:84%
managers, or government
employees-- to fix this.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:90%
And they know how to fix it.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.770 align:middle line:90%
They can fix it.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
When will the
population decide, OK,

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:84%
we want the red
button turned green?

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
FASAB 56, Catherine?

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: So I call it FASB 56--

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.540 align:middle line:84%
is a policy that
was implemented.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Mark Skidmore and I--

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michigan State
University, right?

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.856 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Michigan
State University.

00:15:42.856 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:84%
He heard me talking about
the fact that, in 2015,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Department of Defense
and HUD were missing

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
records amounts of
money-- in total almost $7

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:84%
trillion dollars--
between the two of them.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.088 align:middle line:84%
And he assumed I'd
made a mistake.

00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, that can't--

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: That's way too big.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:90%
That can't--

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No way, right?

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: That's no way.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So he went and looked
up the documents.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:84%
He found the footnote
on page 135--

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is--

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and discovered, no, I was right.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so he called me.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:90%
And he said, can I help?

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So we talked, and
I said, you bet.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.980 align:middle line:84%
After 30 years of
dealing with this,

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:84%
it was like the
cavalry arriving.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So he agreed that he would
get some of his students

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:90%
and do a survey.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And, George, I
and my subscribers

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:84%
had found 12.5
trillion of reports

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.850 align:middle line:90%
of undocumentable adjustments.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:90%
So he went through.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was just DOD and HUD,
not all government agencies.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds simple.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge job.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And I put up a website
with all the documentation

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:90%
so you can see it.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Go to missingmoney.solari.com
and you can see everything.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.060 align:middle line:90%
It's all public.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.978 align:middle line:84%
So he kept calling
me and saying,

00:16:58.978 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:84%
oh, my god, I found
another trillion.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He found
another, another.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: I found another.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was in
shock, because he's

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:10.175 align:middle line:84%
a very competent, capable
person with deep knowledge of--

00:17:10.175 --> 00:17:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the other agencies?

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: --government.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You only looked at two.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.349 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: We haven't
looked at those.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, so he
calls me up one day.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And we published the report
when he'd found 18 trillion,

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:84%
but we kept adding,
adding, adding.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, it hit 21
trillion-- which, at the time,

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.763 align:middle line:84%
was the same as the
US outstanding debt.

00:17:28.763 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Now, the debt
is growing very quickly.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:90%
It's in a--

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
little higher, now.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, we're in a
spiral up, which is dangerous.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Talk about inflation.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:90%
It's dangerous.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so the back and
forth between government

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:90%
and Dr. Skidmore and I started.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I told him is,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
before we publish
your report, I want

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to download all the
documents and put them

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.108 align:middle line:84%
on a separate website
with archives offline.

00:17:58.108 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, he thought I was paranoid.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.155 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] We launched
the website.

00:18:02.155 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you?

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: All the documents-- no.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:84%
The IT's office at DOD and HUD
took down all the documents.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They took them down?

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.773 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And you
should have seen him.

00:18:12.773 --> 00:18:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen-- he's
a serious scholar.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:90%
He's a very serious person.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:90%
He's a very serious scholar.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:84%
In a million years, he
didn't think it was possible.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.540 align:middle line:90%
And when it--

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's a believer, now.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, when it
happened, he was really shocked.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.415 align:middle line:84%
And then, I won't
bore you with the--

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
there were many,
many things that

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:90%
shocked him in the process.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.882 align:middle line:90%
It's quite a funny story.

00:18:31.882 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But we then made a
big deal about it

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:90%
in a variety of radio shows.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, I bitched to the
White House-- called them

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and said, put those
documents back.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So they put him up
on a different URL

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and said, oh, we're
reorganizing our website.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, for the HUD
IG and the DOD IG

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
to be reorganizing their
website at the exact same time

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:90%
was quite a coincidence.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, what happened was
there was back and forth.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And DOD said-- for what was far
from the first time-- oh, we're

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.798 align:middle line:90%
going to take care of this.

00:19:01.798 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do a real audit.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I have to tell you
is, if your bank told you

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:84%
that they were missing
$21,000 of your money--

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd go nuts.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, no, you wouldn't
leave them alone until you got

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.200 align:middle line:90%
the $21,000--

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely,
I'd be on them all the time.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Yeah, so if
they came back and said,

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.367 align:middle line:84%
well, don't worry, we're
going to do an audit,

00:19:18.367 --> 00:19:20.483 align:middle line:84%
it won't happen again,
what would you say?

00:19:20.483 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't care.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:90%
I want the money back in.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.884 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: With the $21--

00:19:22.884 --> 00:19:25.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING] Where is the money?

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Where is the money?

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you why this
is so important to me.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:84%
$5 trillion dollars
is the amount

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:84%
we're always told the US
pension funds are underfunded.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we can
disappear $21 trillion

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:90%
from the US government--

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: $5 billion's nothing.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: If we can disappear
$24 to $29 trillion

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.520 align:middle line:84%
during the bailouts
to banks who we

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:84%
have no legal obligation for,
why can't we fund $5 trillion

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:90%
on US, you know?

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.598 align:middle line:84%
So to me, this is
all about politics.

00:19:54.598 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had a chance
to talk with Dr. Joseph

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:90%
Farrell about this.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: So a lot of liability
cleaning up is happening.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.943 align:middle line:10%
DOD makes a big deal
about doing an audit.

00:20:05.943 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't mention that they're
not going to go back and find

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:10%
the $21 trillion.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Moves forward with
an audit, comes out

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.870 align:middle line:84%
with, ultimately,
disclosure saying

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:middle line:90%
they can't produce an audit.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:10%
And we see the Federal
Accounting Standards Advisory

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:10%
Board publish a proposed
policy in the summer saying,

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.880 align:middle line:10%
we need the ability
to do secret books.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly, exactly.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: And if we can't
do secret books where

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:10%
we need to do secret
books, then we're

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:10%
going to have to redact the
entire department of defense.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.557 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a perfect
way to launder money,

00:20:40.557 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: Absolutely.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a wonderful way to
take all that missing money,

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:10%
put it into a foundation, and
then let the foundation act

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.272 align:middle line:10%
as the cut out.

00:20:50.272 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that
exactly what they're doing?

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
They're laundering money?

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.745 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well,
here's my concern.

00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I just published-- and this
is part of this big collection

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.312 align:middle line:90%
that we've just produced--

00:20:59.312 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:84%
an article with
one of my attorneys

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:90%
called, Caveat Emptor.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what it says--
if you are an investor,

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:84%
we have had a material event,
and you must do due diligence.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:84%
The rating agencies
can't do this for you.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:90%
The broker dealers can't do it.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And you need to understand
this is a material event.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:84%
With FASB 56, George,
what I believe is--

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
our pension funds, by
Treasury securities?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
They can turn around and
take the assets purchased,

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.765 align:middle line:84%
or the money, and just
move it out into private--

00:21:27.765 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And just
take it away from us?

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.223 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I believe they
can just move it out

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:33.980 align:middle line:84%
into private corporations
and private hands.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot of accounting
detail on why they would say

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:90%
you can't.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, if
you have secret people who

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:84%
can do secret things, and
they've made this secret rule

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.953 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't obey
the last set of rules,

00:21:45.953 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:84%
it means they're not going
to obey any set of rules.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.912 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, look
what happened in Greece

00:21:49.912 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
where they, basically, took
half of everybody's savings

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:90%
right out of their bank account.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, and I go
back to the rape of Russia.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:84%
The rape of Russia
was, in my opinion,

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.330 align:middle line:84%
very much engineered
by the US intelligence

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:90%
agencies and treasury.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And they basically just emptied
the pension funds, emptied

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.980 align:middle line:90%
the government, emptied--

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
they call it privatization,
I call it piratization.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Piratization-- if I take a
piece of real estate worth $100

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and move it into
private hands for $1,

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:90%
that's not privatization.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.343 align:middle line:90%
That's piratization.

00:22:21.343 --> 00:22:22.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:90%
So that's my concern.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.050 align:middle line:84%
My concern, when I saw
FASB 56 is, basically,

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
planning on taking
everything else.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:84%
But part of it is we're talking
about a fundamental governance

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:90%
issue.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:84%
If I can-- through
the NSA, or the IRS--

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:42.350 align:middle line:84%
see everything you do,
say, write, whatever,

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and so you disclose 100% to me
of everything like "The Truman

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Show" and, meantime,
I, the government,

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:84%
can keep everything
secret from you--

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:84%
from you as an
investor and purchaser

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
of treasury securities,
as you as a taxpayer,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:84%
as you as a citizen
with responsibilities

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.890 align:middle line:90%
under the Constitution--

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
then the balance of
power has shifted

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:09.190 align:middle line:84%
into something which is
much more akin to sort

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.010 align:middle line:90%
of a friendly fascism.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are all these other
countries doing the same thing,

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:90%
or is it just us?

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I think there's
a variety of models.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But I think every
country in the world

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
is moving to what is
called technocracy--

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:27.250 align:middle line:84%
which Patrick Wood, who
runs "Technocracy News,"

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:90%
calls a digital despotism--

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:84%
which is basically highly
invasive ownership and control

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:84%
at a very intimate level
using digital technology

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:84%
to basically micromanage and
control and harvest your world.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But what we've seen
in the United States

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.230 align:middle line:84%
is a harvesting of
the American people,

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:90%
of the American middle class.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And the bailouts-- I call
it a financial coup d'etat.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And that if you take
the missing money

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:84%
from the federal government
and the bailouts,

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about an
extraordinary shift of wealth

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:84%
by means I would say
is outside the law.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, they would argue that
it's under national security.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.480 align:middle line:84%
But national
security laws become

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.910 align:middle line:84%
sort of a big joke, which is,
we can do whatever we want.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever we want.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: You can't do anything.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, OK, if
it's national security

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.500 align:middle line:84%
law, why do we need to make
everybody rich who's doing it?

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I'm playing
with government money,

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and I can rig the markets
and rig things the way

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I want, then I don't need to pay
myself a large margin, [LAUGHS]

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, not at all,
you already have it.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Right, I'm playing
with government resources.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So why do we need a small group
of people to get wildly rich?

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you have your
retirement, Catherine,

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and a private mutual
fund, can they touch it?

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.117 align:middle line:90%
Can they grab it?

00:24:47.117 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Well, it's interesting.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
At one point, one
of the gold groups

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:84%
wrote a letter to
Treasury and said,

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.007 align:middle line:84%
do you reserve the right
to confiscate our gold?

00:24:55.007 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And they wrote back and
said, we reserve the right

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:90%
to confiscate everything.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So let's talk
about the outstanding debt.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.133 align:middle line:84%
We have $22 trillion
officially outstanding debt.

00:25:06.133 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't include--

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On the books, right?

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.415 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Right, it
doesn't include lots

00:25:10.415 --> 00:25:11.970 align:middle line:90%
of other liabilities, as well.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you just take
the official number

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.320 align:middle line:84%
of the outstanding debt,
we're in a debt spiral up.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So last year, our
debt increased 6%.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:90%
This year, it's increasing 8%.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.760 align:middle line:84%
There was fear that
rising interest rates

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.740 align:middle line:90%
was going to compound that.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.310 align:middle line:84%
But we're in a debt spiral up
where we're going into a world

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
where the question
is, how are we going

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:90%
to finance the increasing debt?

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:90%
So for many, many years now--

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:84%
you and I are sort
of baby boomers--

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:84%
the boomers have been
working and putting money

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.210 align:middle line:84%
into their pension
funds, or putting money

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
into their bank account,
or putting in their money

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:90%
into insurance companies.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.742 align:middle line:84%
And all those entities
went out and bought

00:25:54.742 --> 00:25:55.950 align:middle line:90%
a lot of Treasury securities.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.575 align:middle line:84%
So we put our money
in social security,

00:25:57.575 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:90%
we buy Treasury securities.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.807 align:middle line:84%
Now, the boomers want to
take their money out--

00:26:01.807 --> 00:26:03.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They want to use it.

00:26:03.015 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: --because
they're retiring.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.800 align:middle line:90%
They want to use it.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.980 align:middle line:10%
And that gives the
national security state

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.158 align:middle line:10%
a problem, because they
need a new $1 every year.

00:26:11.158 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To replenish it.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
If we take $1 out,
that's a $2 problem.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.045 align:middle line:84%
So next year, social security
turns negative cash flow.

00:26:21.045 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that what
happened to Bernie Madoff?

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:90%
That's how he collapsed?

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same way.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, but here's
what's interesting.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed one
of the attorneys who

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.850 align:middle line:84%
was an investor in Madoff
and then represented

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.810 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the Madoff victims.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.020 align:middle line:90%
And she sued the bank.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So I was interviewing her
on the "Solari Report."

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.290 align:middle line:84%
This was one of those
shocking moments

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:46.980 align:middle line:84%
that I know it happens to
you at "Coast to Coast".

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in the middle, and
she had sued the bank.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And under bank secrecy laws
and Know Your Customer,

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.840 align:middle line:84%
banks aren't supposed to be
doing the kind of shenanigans

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.007 align:middle line:90%
they were doing with Madoff.

00:26:59.007 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So Madoff had one bank account
from the mid-'90s on, and all

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.140 align:middle line:90%
the money went in there.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And her name was Helen
Shayman-- amazing woman.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.688 align:middle line:84%
And so all the money went in,
and then all the money went out

00:27:13.688 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:90%
of that one bank account.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So was I was interviewing
her, and I said,

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Helen, who was the
securities custodian?

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:84%
She said, there was
none, because there

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.060 align:middle line:90%
were no securities.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So here you have a $60 billion
money management business,

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
securities, and there's

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.943 align:middle line:90%
no securities custodian.

00:27:30.943 --> 00:27:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And the bank knew,
because all the money

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.527 align:middle line:90%
went in, and went out.

00:27:33.527 --> 00:27:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And the bank knew
over all those years.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was over 10 years.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the
bank use the money?

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Yeah, there were
huge balances sitting, not

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:90%
earning interest.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.035 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So something
else is going on.

00:27:45.035 --> 00:27:48.583 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I would love
to know what was going on,

00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know what.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.200 align:middle line:84%
It was clearly an
officially-sanctioned

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:90%
operation, in my opinion.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I was on the board of
the First American Bank.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the
Clark Clifford bank in--

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So Harry Albright,
who'd been a client of mine

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:90%
and was a wonderful man--

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Morgenthau had made him
the trustee of the bank.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is all part
of the BCCI mess.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.480 align:middle line:90%
So Harry calls me.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:84%
He says, I need a
ringer on the board.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if you want
me, Harry, I'm there.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm there.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So had this huge glass
house in McLean, Virginia.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And Harry has the law firm
bring the documents out.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:90%
I had a very steep driveway.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:84%
This huge Brink's truck spends
an hour getting up my driveway.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.128 align:middle line:84%
And then, they back out
box after box of books.

00:28:40.128 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And I had this living
room that was--

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're supposed
to look at all these?

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, I'm
a speed reader.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:10%
So it was on a Thursday,
and I spent four days just

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.910 align:middle line:10%
speed reading all
those documents.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: And it changed my life.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in this huge
glass living room.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm overlooking
the Potomac River.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And I got the boxes spread out
all over in this living room.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And I read thousands and
thousands and thousands

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.270 align:middle line:90%
of pages.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And when it was
over what I realized

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:84%
is, whatever they were doing
had approval from the Fed.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.010 align:middle line:84%
It had approval from
the New York Fed.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.578 align:middle line:84%
It had approval
from the Treasury.

00:29:13.578 --> 00:29:15.870 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're talking
about something that had

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.390 align:middle line:90%
to be officially sanctioned.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.980 align:middle line:90%
It's frightening.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: It was frightening,
it was frightening.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:90%
And part of it was the fight.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And the reason Harry
wanted some ringers--

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.400 align:middle line:84%
the Department of Justice was
trying to seize the proceeds,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and Harry wanted the proceeds
to go back to the depositors.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who won?

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: I think Harry won--

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.730 align:middle line:90%
yeah, if I remember.

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:37.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
particular case,

00:29:37.105 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:84%
you're one of the few people
talking about this publicly.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Are you looking
over your shoulder?

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.548 align:middle line:84%
Because you should
be, Catherine.

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, during
the litigation,

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:46.825 align:middle line:90%
I had to look over my shoulder.

00:29:46.825 --> 00:29:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It was very dangerous, and it's
quite a miracle that I'm alive.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of money.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, but
here's the thing--

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.235 align:middle line:84%
we all come into this
life with a purpose.

00:29:56.235 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I would love to see
America turn around.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons I ended up

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.340 align:middle line:90%
in such an enemy of the state--

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.422 align:middle line:84%
litigation with the
federal government--

00:30:09.422 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:84%
is, when I saw what
they were doing

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.460 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s was
stealing the money,

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:84%
the thing that bothered
me the most was the HUD

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and the Department
of Justice were

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:84%
dropping SWAT teams into
black neighborhoods,

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.590 align:middle line:84%
rounding up innocent kids,
stuffing them in prison.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.073 align:middle line:84%
My old firm was making
money on the prison stocks.

00:30:27.073 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:84%
If you read the
Dillon Reed story,

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:29.780 align:middle line:90%
it describes all of that.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.450 align:middle line:84%
But basically, if you look
at what they were doing--

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:84%
both with globalization and the
re-engineering domestically--

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.990 align:middle line:84%
the world I was
part of had a plan,

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and I thought their
plan was going to fail.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And so when I left the
Bush administration,

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.218 align:middle line:84%
I had created Hamilton
Securities to come up

00:30:47.218 --> 00:30:48.260 align:middle line:90%
with an alternative plan.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.233 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I said,
look, we can't--

00:30:51.233 --> 00:30:53.150 align:middle line:84%
people want to be part
of something excellent.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to be
part of organized crime.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
at some point,

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:84%
you've got to decide
between, are we

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:04.190 align:middle line:84%
going to run this clean or are
we going to run this dirty?

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And if you have to choose--

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I've always said, civilization
is the biggest capital gains

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.140 align:middle line:84%
opportunity on the
planet, [LAUGHS]

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.030 align:middle line:84%
because I really do
believe in markets.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't think technocracy
is going to work.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But their plan was
basically technocracy.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.418 align:middle line:84%
And if you looked at it,
as a financial matter,

00:31:23.418 --> 00:31:24.710 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was going to lose.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I don't want
to be a part of it.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:28.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny--

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that was
smart on your part--

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: But no, I didn't--

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --but dangerous.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Yeah, but
here's the thing--

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:90%
I didn't come here to be safe.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I came here to live a
free and inspired life.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And if you go back--

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Christian--
and particularly,

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.400 align:middle line:84%
if you study Jesus
and what he taught,

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.720 align:middle line:84%
if you read his letter to
the Galatians, he said,

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.970 align:middle line:90%
reject the yoke of bondage.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just wrote a book
called, "Dillon Read & the

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.320 align:middle line:90%
Aristocracy of Stock Prophets."

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at this in depth.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.910 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: There's an old
New Jersey street saying--

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.860 align:middle line:10%
make a law, make a business.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.220 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
this story is about.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.880 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the
popsicle index.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:84%
The popsicle index
is the percentage

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:16.660 align:middle line:84%
of people in a
community who believe

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:84%
a child can leave their
home, go to the nearest place

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to buy a popsicle, and
come home alone safely.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.430 align:middle line:10%
When I was a little girl, the
popsicle index was very high.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Today, it is much lower.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:37.220 align:middle line:10%
During this time, the Dow
Jones index rose by over 6000%.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.390 align:middle line:10%
Why are the popsicle index and
the Dow Jones index at odds?

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:10%
Cui Bono?

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.090 align:middle line:90%
Who benefits?

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Who makes money in the stock
market from a falling popsicle

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.300 align:middle line:90%
index?

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:53.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the story of my search
for answers to these questions

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and of my hope for a
world that preserves

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:58.930 align:middle line:84%
the promise of a rising
popsicle index for our children

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.526 align:middle line:90%
and generations yet unborn.

00:33:00.526 --> 00:33:03.442 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:03.442 --> 00:33:06.360 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
popsicle index, huh?

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So I discovered
this when I was

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Assistant Secretary of Housing.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.210 align:middle line:84%
The first month, I
kept being lobbied

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:18.560 align:middle line:84%
by all the home construction
industry and the mortgage

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.005 align:middle line:90%
finance industry.

00:33:20.005 --> 00:33:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized
is, everybody

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.630 align:middle line:84%
was lobbying me to do whatever
made their stock go up.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.088 align:middle line:84%
And nobody cared about whether
neighborhoods worked or not,

00:33:26.088 --> 00:33:28.080 align:middle line:84%
or whether families
were successful.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, this is strange.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized
is, there was

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:36.690 align:middle line:84%
no place-based optimization,
because government money

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:90%
was running places.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And government money
was running places

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:84%
in a way that had what I call a
negative return on investment.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.380 align:middle line:84%
It was using the government as a
device to sort of launder money

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.895 align:middle line:84%
into people who have made
money in the stock market.

00:33:48.895 --> 00:33:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let them make more.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, to me, I love making money
in the stock market, George.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:55.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm an investment banker.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:90%
So to me, that's--

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sure,
that's what you do.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah, yeah, it's great.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized is we
have a win-lose relationship

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:06.870 align:middle line:84%
between the Dow Jones
index and communities.

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:09.969 align:middle line:84%
So all my work at Hamilton
was, how do we change that?

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's part of making
the red button green.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.150 align:middle line:84%
How do we make
money turning this

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.469 align:middle line:90%
into a win-win relationship?

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're going to
make America great again,

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:22.080 align:middle line:84%
we're either going to gentrify
Americans out of existence

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and destroy them, or we're going
to change that relationship

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.330 align:middle line:90%
to win-win, lose-lose.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.330 align:middle line:84%
We used to have a saying, what's
good for General Motors is

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:90%
good for America.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.254 align:middle line:90%
That was a time--

00:34:33.254 --> 00:34:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: --when there was
a win-win relationship

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:39.659 align:middle line:84%
between the Dow Jones
and the communities.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, how
do we change that back?

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.409 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In 1989, when you
were the Assistant Secretary

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:49.230 align:middle line:84%
of Housing and
Urban Development,

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.900 align:middle line:84%
did you foresee the
housing bubble that

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.570 align:middle line:90%
happened 20 years later?

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:56.409 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: No.

00:34:56.409 --> 00:35:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened
was I started

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to discover the
extent of the fraud

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.900 align:middle line:90%
when I was Assistant Secretary.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.317 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
that come to you?

00:35:06.317 --> 00:35:07.275 align:middle line:90%
What did you see first?

00:35:07.275 --> 00:35:09.359 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, I'll tell
you one of the first ways

00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:10.290 align:middle line:90%
it came to me.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:11.460 align:middle line:90%
I met with the secretary.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And the secretary said,
I am furious about all

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:90%
this corruption.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:84%
I want all this
corruption stopped.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:20.010 align:middle line:84%
We just finished both the
Iran-Contra scandal and the S&L

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:23.910 align:middle line:84%
crisis, so I was there to clean
up and stop the corruption.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want all
this corruption stopped.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there was a
program called coinsurance,

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.990 align:middle line:90%
a very famous example of this.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want this all
stopped and shut down.

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So I said, yes, sir,
left his office.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.710 align:middle line:90%
And I had a deputy.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.830 align:middle line:84%
He called the
deputy in and said,

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:90%
I just told Fitts to stop this.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Make sure she fails.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: So we used to have--

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mixed signals.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: [LAUGHS] Well,
because he needed to tell--

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.798 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He set you up.

00:35:49.798 --> 00:35:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: He needed to tell
the press that he was stopping

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.250 align:middle line:84%
the corruption, but he needed
to keep delivering money

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.860 align:middle line:84%
to the political constituents
in the black budget.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had no plans to stop
it, did he, from the get go?

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: He didn't
have the power.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:11.430 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the Secretary
of HUD does not run HUD.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:14.460 align:middle line:84%
HUD is run by the
banks and defense

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.818 align:middle line:90%
contractors who run HUD.

00:36:15.818 --> 00:36:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course, always was.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So for example, both
when I was Assistant Secretary

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and then, years later when I
was the lead financial advisor,

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I would ask the defense
contractors for data.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.030 align:middle line:84%
They would refuse
to give it to me.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:90%
So it was very interesting.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.140 align:middle line:90%
When I first got to HUD--

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm very big on
understanding what

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.970 align:middle line:84%
your scope of
responsibilities are,

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.270 align:middle line:84%
so I read the law
and the regulations

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to know what the Assistant
Secretary of Housing

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.080 align:middle line:84%
federal housing commissioner
is required by law to do.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So I made a detailed
thing of my scope--

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.740 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's my scope of work.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.585 align:middle line:84%
And one of my biggest
responsibilities

00:36:51.585 --> 00:36:54.570 align:middle line:84%
was running the
Single-Family Insurance Fund.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was required by law to run
it on a self-supporting basis.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.378 align:middle line:84%
So the premiums you
charge for the insurance

00:37:00.378 --> 00:37:01.545 align:middle line:90%
have to cover the defaults--

00:37:01.545 --> 00:37:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They got
to stand on its own.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: --and the expenses.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.233 align:middle line:90%
So I go in.

00:37:06.233 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is very much like
the First American story.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So I ask my budget officer
for all the budgets.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.760 align:middle line:84%
It almost could
go to the ceiling,

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.030 align:middle line:90%
the budget justifications.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I sped read it all weekend
long and called him

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.400 align:middle line:84%
back in on Monday and
said, nowhere here

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:84%
does it say if we're
making or losing money.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.180 align:middle line:90%
Cash in, cash out?

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.110 align:middle line:90%
I can't--

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.093 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, well,
that's not in the budget.

00:37:27.093 --> 00:37:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, where is that?

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.228 align:middle line:90%
He said, the accounts have that.

00:37:30.228 --> 00:37:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, where
are the accounts?

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.937 align:middle line:84%
He said, they report to
another assistant secretary.

00:37:33.937 --> 00:37:36.010 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed
to talk to them.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So I always tell
people, George, I

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.380 align:middle line:84%
raised a lot of money for
the president and what I got

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.070 align:middle line:84%
was a pair of cuff links
and the accounts moved over.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they basically
used you to create this image

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.765 align:middle line:84%
that things are going to change,
things are going to get tough.

00:37:49.765 --> 00:37:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, they never stopped
doing what they were doing.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, actually, it's
like a pendulum, and it swings.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.050 align:middle line:84%
You bring in the clean
team, they clean it up.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Then, you bring the dirty
team in, you harvest it.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.745 align:middle line:84%
It's like the planters
and the harvesters.

00:38:02.745 --> 00:38:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you know that the
dirty team was still out there

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:06.510 align:middle line:90%
doing what it was doing?

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.780 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I did not
understand the extent

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:15.602 align:middle line:90%
to which the finances were run.

00:38:15.602 --> 00:38:17.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
official reality,

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.710 align:middle line:90%
and then there's a reality.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I
left, I was certainly

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:25.280 align:middle line:84%
grappling with the
tension over the gap.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.653 align:middle line:84%
But I had a hard time
understanding how--

00:38:29.653 --> 00:38:31.070 align:middle line:84%
what I couldn't
figure out is, how

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:84%
could they steal that much
money and me not know?

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was only after
I started to litigate

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.300 align:middle line:84%
with the Department of
Justice that I had access

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.960 align:middle line:84%
to the people I needed
to be able to estimate

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.550 align:middle line:90%
the covert flows.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that was
a mixed blessing.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.650 align:middle line:84%
It was dangerous,
but it was wonderful,

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.990 align:middle line:84%
because if you're
going to understand

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:56.090 align:middle line:84%
the global economy or
the American economy,

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.610 align:middle line:84%
you've got to see
the covert flows.

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm always telling
people, our world's

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:02.390 align:middle line:90%
a little bit like Disney World.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:04.670 align:middle line:84%
You've got an upstairs world
with Minnie and Mickey.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, you got
a downstairs where

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.880 align:middle line:90%
everything's being engineered.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going
to understand,

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.980 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand
both together.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is everything
rampant now?

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Is it just out of control?

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, I would
say that what we've had

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.440 align:middle line:84%
is a huge debasement
of the culture that

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.332 align:middle line:90%
has made it much harder.

00:39:25.332 --> 00:39:26.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're a financial
professional,

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:29.580 align:middle line:84%
if you're in bank,
if you're insurance,

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.858 align:middle line:84%
if you're in brokerage, it's
much harder to do your work.

00:39:33.858 --> 00:39:36.150 align:middle line:84%
One-- because there's so much
more fraud in the system.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Finding people of integrity
is a bigger challenge,

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.608 align:middle line:84%
finding institutions
of integrity.

00:39:46.608 --> 00:39:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see
institutions too, now,

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:84%
that I would have
thought was unthinkable.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always telling my
clients and subscribers,

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:59.810 align:middle line:84%
you can't depend on the Federal
Credit to bail everything out.

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.420 align:middle line:84%
In all these different areas
of your financial life,

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.147 align:middle line:84%
you've got to find people in
companies with real integrity.

00:40:05.147 --> 00:40:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think they
use this money for, Catherine?

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.305 align:middle line:90%
The $21 trillion-- where is it?

00:40:09.305 --> 00:40:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, this is
how I met you, George.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.860 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] I don't
know if you remember.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I did my first interview
with you in 2005.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I remember that.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.723 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And you
said, don't you think

00:40:18.723 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:84%
they're using it to deal
with whatever is going on

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:24.050 align:middle line:90%
with the UFO phenomenon?

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.092 align:middle line:84%
I said no, George, I think
they're just stealing.

00:40:26.092 --> 00:40:28.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] And I think it's both.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they lining
their own personal pockets?

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So we're talking about
far too much money to be just

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.710 align:middle line:84%
a group of guys on Wall Street
with Ferraris and off-shore--

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And nice houses, yeah.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So I'm not
saying that people haven't

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:43.820 align:middle line:90%
made an awful lot of money.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:44.660 align:middle line:90%
They have.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So you've had kind
of a gold rush.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And what you've done
is you've used money

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.950 align:middle line:90%
to incentivize people.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's
amazing to me is--

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.640 align:middle line:84%
if you throw enough
money at people,

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.070 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing what you
can get them to do.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's no doubt
that making people rich

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:06.010 align:middle line:84%
has been very helpful in
getting them to destroy--

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.390 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
freedoms that we enjoy here

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:11.480 align:middle line:84%
versus other places in the
world, it's extraordinary.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.345 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:41:12.345 --> 00:41:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course,
it feels wonderful.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah and it's hard.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:16.770 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a perfect example.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.130 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a great article
called, "William Diefenderfer,

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:21.380 align:middle line:90%
The Hit Man of Student Loans."

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I had a former partner
who was very instrumental,

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe, in engineering
the destruction of consumer

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.060 align:middle line:84%
protections for student
loans so that kids

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.340 align:middle line:90%
can't declare bankruptcy now.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.270 align:middle line:90%


00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the article,
I talk about how hard

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:42.230 align:middle line:84%
it is for me to
believe that someone

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:46.010 align:middle line:84%
who was such a high quality
person that I would want him

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.310 align:middle line:90%
on my board would do something.

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, here's someone who--

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's beyond anything.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: The United States
has been so wonderful

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that he has been
so blessed in terms

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.800 align:middle line:84%
of professional accomplishments
and making money.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Why would you turn around and
destroy the next generation?

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do that?

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Because it's an entrapment.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's shocking to me that
someone I know and cared about

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:11.537 align:middle line:90%
would do that.

00:42:11.537 --> 00:42:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And that was the problem
I had in Washington

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.970 align:middle line:84%
with what we were doing in
the poorer neighborhoods.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Because what we were
doing was lawless,

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and it was shocking
to me that people

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.030 align:middle line:90%
would go along with that.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So I just think, when you
have this much secret money,

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:84%
the problem with
secret money, George,

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:34.520 align:middle line:84%
is it's impossible to
optimize it and use it well.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.410 align:middle line:90%
It goes out of control.

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's something happening
that's out of control.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, what
are they dealing with?

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of it is going
into secret military expenses.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely--
space programs.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: A lot of it's
going into space programs.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you saw
this, but at the D-Day--

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:52.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Festivities.

00:42:52.915 --> 00:42:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: --the president
made a reference to,

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.173 align:middle line:84%
we got a man on the moon,
and then we went beyond.

00:42:58.173 --> 00:42:58.973 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:42:58.973 --> 00:43:00.053 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, oops.

00:43:00.053 --> 00:43:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Then he tweets
out that he wants NASA

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.460 align:middle line:90%
to focus on getting to Mars.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.462 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's really
funny, because he

00:43:06.462 --> 00:43:07.670 align:middle line:90%
doesn't like keeping secrets.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:09.890 align:middle line:90%
He wants to share something.

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think a lot of the money
is has gone into space programs.

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:16.568 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
percentage of the GNP

00:43:16.568 --> 00:43:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and the federal
budget that was going

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:22.460 align:middle line:84%
into space at the end of
the Kennedy administration

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.485 align:middle line:84%
and the end of the Johnson
administration, it's gone down.

00:43:25.485 --> 00:43:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
because of the secret.

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:28.777 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The secret
went up, absolutely.

00:43:28.777 --> 00:43:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Right, so I think
the trajectory continued,

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:middle line:84%
but the gap between
what's public

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.930 align:middle line:84%
and that trajectory
has been part of this.

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:39.753 align:middle line:84%
To do that, you've needed
a vast underground.

00:43:39.753 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Network, yep.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So I've
tried to understand

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:43.610 align:middle line:84%
what the underground
installations

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:44.943 align:middle line:90%
and transportation networks are.

00:43:44.943 --> 00:43:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
unbelievably expensive.

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I was in the Netherlands
a couple of years ago,

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:52.820 align:middle line:90%
and this wonderful--

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.320 align:middle line:84%
we had a little luncheon for
subscribers as I travel around.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.840 align:middle line:90%
We have luncheons.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And this wonderful guy
from the city of London

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.780 align:middle line:84%
who had been a trader in the
city of London came over.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
tell me about you.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.405 align:middle line:84%
How did you get hooked up
with the "Solari Report"?

00:44:06.405 --> 00:44:09.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, all those
years I was trading in London,

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I kept looking at the mining
companies and the elevator

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.120 align:middle line:90%
companies.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.542 align:middle line:90%
And I kept thinking, really?

00:44:15.542 --> 00:44:17.000 align:middle line:84%
How are they making
all this money?

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Where are they getting
the money from?

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered
the "Solari Report."

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, that's
where they're getting it.

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's where it's at.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:24.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
take a look at some

00:44:24.027 --> 00:44:26.558 align:middle line:84%
of the things
you've talked about.

00:44:26.558 --> 00:44:29.330 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:33.770 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: We are facing multiple
tsunamis of change that are

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:37.030 align:middle line:10%
coming all at the same time.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:38.780 align:middle line:10%
And it's not like mom
and dad are up there

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.880 align:middle line:10%
planning for this to go right.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.410 align:middle line:10%
So one is the rise of Asia.

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:45.710 align:middle line:10%
We just did the second-quarter
wrap up on the rise of Asia.

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.770 align:middle line:84%
The second is the reshoring of
capital to the United States

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and a shift to a
multipolar world.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.030 align:middle line:84%
We talk a lot about that
on the "Solari Report."

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:55.400 align:middle line:10%
Another, I believe,
is you're seeing

00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:01.430 align:middle line:10%
a real move in the United
States to privatize

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.530 align:middle line:10%
a tremendous amount of
government operations.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:07.127 align:middle line:10%
So all the corporations that
help create the negative return

00:45:07.127 --> 00:45:08.960 align:middle line:10%
on investment, you're
going to double down--

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.370 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] negative
return on investment.

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:12.890 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest
tsunami is the one

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.500 align:middle line:84%
that you've done the most work
on the "Solari Report" about,

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.710 align:middle line:90%
and that is AI.

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Deep learning AI is
rolling out at high speed

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.840 align:middle line:84%
in multiple systems
across this society,

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.753 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
anybody is ready for it.

00:45:26.753 --> 00:45:27.920 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm not ready for it.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying
to understand it.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.930 align:middle line:10%
You and I called
it the AI invasion,

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.750 align:middle line:10%
and I think every
aspect of our life

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:38.810 align:middle line:10%
is going to be invaded by AI.

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And we can't fathom what this
change is going to be like.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.770 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.620 align:middle line:10%
But one of the rules
of thumb I always

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.810 align:middle line:10%
use is an expression
from scripture-- faith

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:51.905 align:middle line:10%
is the substance of things
hoped for, but not yet seen.

00:45:51.905 --> 00:45:54.530 align:middle line:10%
And you hear this a lot when you
listen to the interviews we've

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:56.970 align:middle line:10%
done with John Rappoport.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:00.740 align:middle line:84%
The building block
of reality is created

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.970 align:middle line:90%
from a cement called faith.

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.850 align:middle line:90%


00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.710 align:middle line:10%
Many of us are
trained to believe

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:09.890 align:middle line:10%
we have to understand
where the world is going

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.500 align:middle line:10%
and align ourselves to
match it-- so in line

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.810 align:middle line:10%
with the primary
trends, which is fine.

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:21.110 align:middle line:10%
But the reality is, our world
is created through our faith.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:24.980 align:middle line:10%
You have to-- and I've told
you many stories about where

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.260 align:middle line:10%
I was told it was hopeless,
and I had to go along.

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.360 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm not going along.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.300 align:middle line:90%
So kill me, I'm not going along.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.440 align:middle line:90%
You stand on faith.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Faith is the substance.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the building
blocks of reality.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:38.690 align:middle line:90%
It's our faith.

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you really
believe AI is going

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.830 align:middle line:90%
to have a big effect on us?

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Huge.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:43.690 align:middle line:90%
It's having a--

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It already is.

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: It's had a huge effect
for the last 10 years, yeah.

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
every possibility.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It's involved in
privacy, financial.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:53.840 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So I'm going to grossly
oversimplify to make a point.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.790 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't for the
distribution of smartphones

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and AI, we would be
having hyperinflation.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question about it?

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Are you concerned about
the future for all of us?

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the $21 trillion
aside that they're hiding.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.040 align:middle line:90%
What about other things-- wars?

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So one of the
greatest comments I ever got--

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I used to work for somebody
who was very non-critical.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.273 align:middle line:84%
But only occasionally
would he criticize.

00:47:27.273 --> 00:47:29.190 align:middle line:84%
But one day turned to
me, and he looked at me.

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:30.390 align:middle line:84%
He says, you know
what your problem is?

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:31.470 align:middle line:90%
You fret too much.

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:33.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:37.500 align:middle line:84%
So I worry about the future
in the sense that, to me--

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm a risk manager.

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know, what can I
do to teach my subscribers how

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:44.070 align:middle line:90%
to lower the risk?

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot about
making money or being free

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:48.000 align:middle line:90%
is lowering your risk.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, and being ready.

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Well--

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:52.247 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's so important.

00:47:52.247 --> 00:47:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I don't think you
can predict the future.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I think the future is
invented, not predicted.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.122 align:middle line:84%
But the more you
can identify risks

00:48:00.122 --> 00:48:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and know how you're
going to handle them,

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:02.738 align:middle line:90%
the more you can be--

00:48:02.738 --> 00:48:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Be ready for it.

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.013 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah, know how to duck.

00:48:06.013 --> 00:48:07.680 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
to know how to duck.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.097 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a risk manager, because
I like to know how to duck.

00:48:10.097 --> 00:48:15.330 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe
that the future

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:20.220 align:middle line:84%
is defined by our
spiritual power and faith.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And whatever happens,
it's going to be

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:27.390 align:middle line:84%
what our spiritual power
and faith make happen.

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:30.062 align:middle line:84%
So I'm much more focused
on inventing the future

00:48:30.062 --> 00:48:31.020 align:middle line:90%
than worrying about it.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're concerned
about finances, health,

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.340 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of issues, aren't you?

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Yeah, and one
of the reasons, George,

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:39.210 align:middle line:90%
is for 11 years I was an--

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I still do screening as
an investment advisor,

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:45.220 align:middle line:84%
but I don't do individual
consultations anymore.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.040 align:middle line:84%
But when I did,
one of the things

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.490 align:middle line:84%
I discovered is the thing
that was most harming people's

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:54.240 align:middle line:84%
finances were
non-financial things.

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So you can't look at somebody
just as a financial matter.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the points I
always made was-- people

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.890 align:middle line:84%
would tell me that they
couldn't afford really

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:07.240 align:middle line:90%
good, fresh food, organic food.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.180 align:middle line:90%
I was like, are you nuts?

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Because while they're
having millions

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:13.650 align:middle line:84%
sitting in their
brokerage account,

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.470 align:middle line:84%
they're literally
getting physically

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:20.850 align:middle line:84%
toxic from the
pesticides or whatever.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So I said, look, you've got
to look at your balance sheet

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:30.660 align:middle line:90%
in a holistic way.

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to look at
your children and your family.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you know this
story, but the reason I'm alive

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:41.070 align:middle line:84%
was when I was on Wall Street--
you know, I love making money.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Whenever anybody in my family
or friends were in trouble,

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.595 align:middle line:84%
I would give them
or loan them money.

00:49:45.595 --> 00:49:46.395 align:middle line:90%
And when--

00:49:46.395 --> 00:49:47.655 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never to get it back.

00:49:47.655 --> 00:49:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, when the
Department of Justice

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:55.470 align:middle line:84%
came after me, they tried to
shut off my income, my credit.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And they would throw make-work
at me to just evaporate them.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:01.230 align:middle line:84%
They would come up with a
make-work that would cost me

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:03.060 align:middle line:90%
a quarter of a million dollars.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So everybody got together and
said, well, she helped us,

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:09.180 align:middle line:90%
so we should help her.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I had a wealthy uncle who
really financed me for 11 years.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really, that long?

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.630 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:17.588 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: But he said,
she helped everyone else,

00:50:17.588 --> 00:50:18.840 align:middle line:90%
so I'll help her.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.730 align:middle line:90%
I was able to pay him back.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:22.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you, Cath.

00:50:22.995 --> 00:50:25.975 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: But I counted up--

00:50:25.975 --> 00:50:28.100 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them then paid me
back because, they said,

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.440 align:middle line:90%
you need it back.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
didn't have much money,

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:34.840 align:middle line:84%
but they'd send me $50,
$100 a month, or whatever.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:35.640 align:middle line:90%
It adds up.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.723 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just to help you.

00:50:36.723 --> 00:50:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: But I counted it up.

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I had gifted or loaned a
quarter of a million dollars,

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:44.067 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly what
got gifted and paid back.

00:50:44.067 --> 00:50:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was that quarter
of a million dollars

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:46.765 align:middle line:90%
that saved my life.

00:50:46.765 --> 00:50:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So my best
investment that I ever

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.715 align:middle line:84%
made was gifting and loaning
money to family and friends.

00:50:52.715 --> 00:50:53.965 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Helping other people.

00:50:53.965 --> 00:50:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:58.110 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is, I'm a big
investor in people. if you

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:01.470 align:middle line:84%
are in our quarterly wrap-ups,
there's a donation page.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you come to Solari, every
week, we're posting donations.

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:07.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's my way of saying--

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:08.188 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you.

00:51:08.188 --> 00:51:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah, thank you.

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:12.420 align:middle line:84%
But also, here are good
people doing good things.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Let's help them.

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the reasons
I love crowdfunding,

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:20.130 align:middle line:84%
because lots of people
can get together, and all

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:22.712 align:middle line:84%
give a little bit, but
really make things go.

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's
assume the $21 trillion

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.910 align:middle line:90%
dollars is never discovered.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:28.946 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:51:28.946 --> 00:51:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to be OK?

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:32.358 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: It's not gone, George.

00:51:32.358 --> 00:51:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Those assets are real, and
they're running around right

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:35.525 align:middle line:90%
in front of our face.

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:43.640 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And the companies that
engaged in those transactions--

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.360 align:middle line:84%
so you have both defense
contractors, IT contractors,

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and banks--

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:50.410 align:middle line:90%
they're liable for that money.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So you could say, OK, well,
the money's on the moon.

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:55.613 align:middle line:84%
They're liable, and
they have assets.

00:51:55.613 --> 00:51:56.655 align:middle line:90%
They have balance sheets.

00:51:56.655 --> 00:52:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're liable only
if somebody discloses this.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Yes, but
there is such a thing

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.300 align:middle line:90%
as a political negotiation.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So when we come to
Congress and negotiate--

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.310 align:middle line:84%
whether it's social
security, or pension funds,

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:14.780 align:middle line:90%
or any of these things--

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.260 align:middle line:84%
as a political matter, we
can put that on the table.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.498 align:middle line:84%
That fact can go on
the table as part of--

00:52:20.498 --> 00:52:22.040 align:middle line:84%
they can say, well,
there's no money.

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well,
well, wait a minute.

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Where's the $21 trillion?

00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:26.570 align:middle line:90%
That's our--

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's our start.

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: That's our money.

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Our money, so don't--

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:31.993 align:middle line:90%
and not only that.

00:52:31.993 --> 00:52:33.410 align:middle line:84%
You're running
secret books, so we

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:35.660 align:middle line:84%
don't know these assets
aren't disappearing.

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's our money.

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can either do an
audit and get that money back,

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:42.140 align:middle line:90%
or you can fix this.

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:47.300 align:middle line:10%
So as political leverage,
that information--

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.090 align:middle line:10%
Nicholas Negroponte once
said, in the digital age,

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:52.700 align:middle line:10%
data about money is
worth more than money.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.700 align:middle line:84%
That data in the political
process, used effectively,

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:56.827 align:middle line:90%
is worth a lot.

00:52:56.827 --> 00:52:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.300 align:middle line:84%

And thank you for

00:53:01.495 --> 00:53:02.787 align:middle line:90%
you've given me over this year.

00:53:02.787 --> 00:53:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:06.140 align:middle line:10%

00:53:11.442 --> 00:53:13.070 align:middle line:90%
