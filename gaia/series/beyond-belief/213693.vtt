00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome to
this edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:10%
Lisa Barnett back with us, the
founder of the Akashic Knowing

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:10%
School of Wisdom, where she
teaches students worldwide

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:10%
to transform their lives
through quantum healing

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:10%
and by accessing
their Akashic Records.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
She is also the author of
four internationally known

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
bestselling books about
the Akashic Records.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.083 align:middle line:84%
Lisa, welcome back
to the program.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LISA BARNETT:
Thank you, George.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure to
be with you again.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us, what
are the Akashic Records?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:10%
>>BARNETT: So the
records are the recording

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:10%
of your soul's journey through
all time-space continuum, which

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:10%
means that from the
moment you individuated

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:10%
from source until you eventually
return home, everything

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:10%
your soul does, every place,
plain, dimension it lives in,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:10%
is recorded in
this etheric energy

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:10%
that we refer to as the
Akasha or the Akashic Records.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By a little magic, we
have a picture of your book.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at that, Lisa.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that something?

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.468 align:middle line:90%
Who did your artwork?

00:01:23.468 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] A lovely
person that my publisher

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:90%
picked out for me.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And I just love that.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the big library.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:10%
It's a great way to imagine
the Akashic Records,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:10%
is the library of your soul.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
Akashic Records, who

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
puts the information into it?

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Your
soul automatically

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
uploads everything
you have ever done.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
So it would be like, if you
had a videotape always running

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
in your head and it
was uploaded every day,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.180 align:middle line:84%
so that was recorded in
your etheric library.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are
the record keepers?

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: The record keepers
are the beings of light

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:84%
that keep your specific
Akashic Record.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, the beautiful thing
that very few people really

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:84%
are aware of, is that you have a
team of half a dozen or a dozen

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Akashic Record
keepers or librarians

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:84%
keeping your Akashic
library organized.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Must you die to
enter the Akashic Records?

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely not.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
The record keepers say that
it is everyone's birthright

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
to have access into their
own personal Akashic Record,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
so you can understand
your life, why you came

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and who you've been
in other times.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
heard of soul contracts.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
What are they and who
do we sign them with?

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [CHUCKLES]
So we actually sign them

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:90%
with other souls.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Before you are born, we
write a whole big plan.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:90%
So you write the soul plan.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
You might write 50
or 100 soul contracts

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:84%
with all these souls
that you would like

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:90%
to be in relationship with.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So you actually contract
them before you all embody,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:90%
each lifetime.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
break the contract

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:84%
or are we stuck
with them forever?

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: The good news is,
is that they are breakable.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And often they end because
not only are they all--

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
they're not meant to be like
a lifetime of contracts.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you might have
a half a dozen contracts

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:90%
instead of 100 contracts.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:90%
So many of them end.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
They might be short
term learning,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
they might be short term
support or long term support.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
contracts that we write,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:90%
do we have an input into them?

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So, again, if you can
imagine that your soul says,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going back to Earth again
and I have so much I want to do.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:84%
We are very excited about
coming back to Earth and all

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
that we can accomplish
when we're here in a body.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So we want to
support other people,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:90%
and they want to support us.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
We want to teach and share
wisdom that we've learned.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
They want to share some of
their own wisdom with us.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we often
have challenges

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
with some of these
other humans, and that

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
would be a karmic pattern that
you wanted to work through.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:84%
You actually chose to bring
that challenge into your life

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.405 align:middle line:90%
so you could learn as a soul.

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In one
of your readings,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
you address a client's
question about her husband

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:84%
that has been very close
to death several times.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.712 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:04:41.712 --> 00:04:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TIKA CALDWELL: I feel
like the angel of death

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
was here and left
a couple of times.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:90%
What do the records say?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel that, and
maybe this is not accurate,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.790 align:middle line:84%
but it's almost like I've been
through some type of initiation

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of embodiment for the healing
journey that he's been on

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.780 align:middle line:90%
and we've been living through.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.270 align:middle line:90%
He's 20 years older than me.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it didn't make a
difference until several years

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:90%
He's 85.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm 65.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%
But the amount of courage,
intuition, strength and presence

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:84%
that it has required, while I
wouldn't wish it on my family

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
member or enemy, I do believe
that I'm more grounded, embodied

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:90%
for what we have lived through.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've had to face his
passing squarely and willing.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And ask myself, who
am I in his absence?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And then now he's
sticking around some more.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: I love it.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because what the
record keepers are saying

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:84%
is that this has been a
passage for both of you,

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:90%
really, of choice.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:90%
For him, do I want to do this?

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:90%
Can we do this?

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Is this possible, him having
to really search more his soul?

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And then when he chose, yes,
I'm willing, then, of course,

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:84%
then the body is following
along and saying,

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:90%
OK, then we'll get better.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts of
ways we can get better.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the way I hear
it is, his soul just

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:84%
wasn't sure he had it in
him that the world was

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:84%
going to pull it
together in time,

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:90%
that it was worth his staying.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:84%
All of those kinds
of things I'm hearing

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
were part of his
decision and his choices.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And for you, it's beautiful
because you've come through.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Also, is that I can hold this
energy with or without him

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:90%
if need be.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is profound in
you grounding yourself

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and holding the
light and knowing

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that you are truly
that, that it's not only

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:90%
with him or with other people.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
You are that huge, ancient,
beautiful, angelic being

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
of light who has
come to do this work.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And you've done it again
and again and again

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:84%
in all these other
worlds and sacred sites

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and different times
and other planets.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And you could step into
that and really own that.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.475 align:middle line:84%
And that's their
really biggest message.

00:07:44.475 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lisa,
when somebody dies

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:84%
from an illness or some
kind of motorcycle accident

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of situation,
is that predetermined?

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: It often is.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we make a
very complex plan

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish many, many things
and bring our gifts and talents

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.180 align:middle line:84%
back to humanity and love
certain people and be supported.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't always
work out that way.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So the way I hear it
from the record keepers

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.430 align:middle line:84%
is that most of us
have a couple, they

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:90%
say, five to seven exit points.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So there are times where we
maybe get really far off plan

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:90%
because we're very unconscious.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And we may choose that
motorcycle accident

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.770 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes the
illness is to say,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I really want to come back soon
and redo what I meant to do

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't accomplished
yet in this life.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so there are times
where they're written in,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they're these
exit points that we also

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
put into our records
as a possible--

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So are you
saying we have the right

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:90%
to choose our own life destiny?

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, which
is absolutely huge,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.990 align:middle line:84%
because not only are you
writing that plan before you

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.920 align:middle line:84%
embody, but you are
also, when embodied,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
you can write new soul
contracts that you didn't

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:90%
write before you came here.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
You can end some because
I've learned this.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The other person is
not going to come

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:90%
on board with that contract.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we choose to really
consciously end that contract

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:90%
for this lifetime.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
We may come back and
work with them again,

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes that
other person will

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.600 align:middle line:84%
do some work with someone
else to complete the contract.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.520 align:middle line:90%
So we have absolute free will.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Do the Akashic
Records take us back

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:90%
into our family origins?

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes, you can.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So we can look at the ancestral
lineage of our family.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So often when a client
comes to me, they say,

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm experiencing this illness.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Some of this emotional pain and
trauma in my life, some of this

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:90%
comes from my childhood.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Where else is it coming from?

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And often the record keepers
will say that some of it

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:90%
comes from past lives.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So we bring some of the
challenges from other lives

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.700 align:middle line:84%
into this life to
complete those challenges.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And we often may pick
a specific family

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:33.470 align:middle line:84%
for that actual health
challenge or emotional challenge

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:90%
or experience.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually,
in the quantum void,

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
do quite a bit of
healing on these sorts

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
of ancestral lineage energies
and past life energies.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So things are also
not written in stone.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:90%
They are malleable.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your new book covers
stories by other people,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:90%
I think at least 15.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes, absolutely.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So I was very excited to
do this new book, where

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:84%
many of my students
wrote stories

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:84%
about experiences they have
had by accessing the Akashic

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Records.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it gives
people a great idea

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
of how you might even
use the Akashic Records.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:10%
One of my students, I remember,
was having a challenge

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.010 align:middle line:10%
with the land, her family land.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:10%
And she wanted to sell
it, but it wouldn't sell.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.495 align:middle line:84%
And yet there was a lot of
negative and dark energy

00:11:33.495 --> 00:11:34.295 align:middle line:90%
in the land.

00:11:34.295 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Animosity.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yeah.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So literally, working
in the Akashic records,

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
she got so much information,
how to heal the land,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
how to change things that
eventually then, her property

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:90%
sold.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And she and her family moved
on with greater ease and grace.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And so lots and lots
of amazing examples

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.492 align:middle line:84%
of how people use the Akashic
Records in their everyday life.

00:11:58.492 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in even

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:90%
reading Akashic Records?

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
You didn't just wake
up one day and say,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm going
to do for a living.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So I had a
little healing center,

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing energy
readings and healings.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I was more intuitive.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, one day, I
heard this big energetic voice,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and they gave me all
of this information.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, I had been
reading more the energy

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:84%
fields, the chakras, the
higher self of a client

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:90%
and doing healing.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But this was like this infinite
information and wisdom.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
All of these other
lifetimes, the soul plan

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.580 align:middle line:84%
was coming through, some of
their future possible choices.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, holy moly,
that's just amazing!

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
took quite a while.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Back then, nobody was really
talking about the Akashic

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Records really back
much in the '80s, '90s.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Even 2000s, when I started
to really bring the work out,

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:84%
often people would
still say, Akasha,

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:90%
what are you talking about?

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:16.650 align:middle line:84%
So I naturally was called
into the Akashic energy

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:90%
by the record keepers.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the Akashic
records your book of life?

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Is that the same thing?

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Yes,
it absolutely is.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And so many different
religions have

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.680 align:middle line:84%
written about, in different
ways, the book of life.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And it had been known of,
and we were very aware of it

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:84%
thousands and
thousands of years ago.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But during the Dark
Ages, the people

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:84%
were using it for
their own gain.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the energy of the
Akasha was literally pulled

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:84%
from the planet, so that people
could not access it any longer.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we forgot about
it over that last 1,000 years.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And so when the record
keepers came to me, they said,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:90%
it's time.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the time, we're
moving into this new age.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move
into higher dimensions.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
It's time that
humanity has access

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:84%
again into this expansive
wisdom of their soul.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do we have
full access now, Lisa?

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: We have
pretty full access.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:84%
The bigger galactic Akashic
Records are opening.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, so most of what
we see in the regular Akashic

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Records, that we call the
Akasha or Akashic Records,

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:84%
are mostly about
our human lives.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Lot of detail in there about
the last 5000, 8,000 years,

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.010 align:middle line:90%
all of these different lives.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're old.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: We are very old.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we are, George.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the
galactic, of course,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:84%
the more deeper information
about the other worlds,

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say that
all of us are starseeds.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So whether you're from Sirius
or the Pleiades or Arcturus

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:84%
or whatever other
world you're from,

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:84%
the information and
those connections

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.590 align:middle line:90%
are opening and deepening.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually get more
information about past lives

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:90%
from some of these other worlds.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we tap into
somebody else's Akashic Records?

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, so we only
access someone else's Akashic

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.743 align:middle line:84%
Records with their full
consent and permission.

00:15:31.743 --> 00:15:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They have
to let us know.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course,
I do readings.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.280 align:middle line:84%
That's what I do with clients,
is I open their Akashic Records.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
They get to ask me the questions
that they're curious about.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
We all have those big questions,
and I can answer them.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I can talk to, hear, see, feel
their Akashic Record keepers,

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and answer their
questions for them.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With these records,
we chose what we want to do,

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.600 align:middle line:90%
where we want to go?

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Part of
our plan, absolutely.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, because
we're infinite

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:84%
souls and we really
have intentions

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
to either do something
great with humanity,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:84%
maybe to support some humans
that become our family

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
or to create a new invention
to change the world.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.630 align:middle line:84%
We're often really coming
here to help humanity wake up

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and to start to
transform the world.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the most of the
people you have on your show

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:84%
are those lightworkers who
are here to help us transform.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could we have
originated on other planets?

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
brought us here?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, that's
always such a great question

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:84%
because I believe
that it's usually

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
much easier on other
worlds and planets.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And we come to Earth
for this very specific

00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:00.980 align:middle line:84%
physical experience, the love
that we have in this realm.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
physical, 3D world,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
where we don't have
that anywhere else.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So this experience
can be very fulfilling

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.599 align:middle line:84%
if you spend a lot of
your lifetimes in a more

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:84%
etheric, non-human form
or less dense human form.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:90%
So we think it's fun.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:90%
And we also learn and grow.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the records,
Lisa, etched in stone,

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.329 align:middle line:90%
or can they be changed?

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:84%
What if we did something
horrendous a long time ago?

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Can we get in
there and erase it?

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS]
In a way, George,

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:84%
we actually can, because
they're not written in stone.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine
that everything

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:84%
is held, of course, in the
quantum field of source,

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:90%
everything is always happening.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.980 align:middle line:84%
We can, in that energy
of the quantum void,

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.970 align:middle line:90%
go outside of time and space.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
This is how I do
healing for clients.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Go outside.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:90%
I can see that lifetime.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And less erasing it because
we did something horrific,

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:84%
but more about helping
to release emotional pain

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and trauma that we've
created for ourselves

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and is actually affecting
our personal life.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So often, people have
all these blocks,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming from past
lives in other different times

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and spaces that
we're still feeling

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.393 align:middle line:90%
in this life and this body.

00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
In a reading that you
had with another one

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:90%
of your many clients--

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you tap
into the wreckage

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.510 align:middle line:84%
to discover this person's
galactic origins.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.092 align:middle line:90%


00:18:44.092 --> 00:18:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: And I see,
you definitely have

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:90%
some Sirian, Arcturian iron.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And it makes sense because
you have a lot of them.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going to say,
older kind of starseed

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:84%
lives because you actually came
in from the Andromeda galaxy.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So Andromeda's whole
another galaxy.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.660 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, it's supposed
to eventually come in,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.410 align:middle line:84%
or we're supposed to merge
the Milky Way and Andromeda.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.200 align:middle line:84%
But that'll probably
take billions of years,

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.960 align:middle line:84%
so I don't think we'll really
be around for that show.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So Andromedans are really,
because they're even so from so

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:56.210 align:middle line:84%
far away, so ancient,
such kind of travelers.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.603 align:middle line:84%
You're definitely a
galactic traveler type.

00:19:59.603 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you use that prayer, the
galactic traveler access prayer

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:90%
to open the records?

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah, I'm used the--

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I started with galactic,
the first course,

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and then I moved
to the Andromeda.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So that makes sense, because
you are those types of worlds.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's not just that.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:84%
It's you've been Arcturian,
Sirian, lived a lot of places

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:90%
because we are so infinite.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even know that we
can believe or understand what

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:90%
that means in our human brain.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:84%
But I love a lot of those
different kinds of energies

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
which are very much about
helping humanity to wake

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:90%
up at this point.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I always feel the
Arcturians have

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
such a mission to
also help us go

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:90%
from war to peace to awakening.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So big, big energy around
that bringing peace

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:84%
to humanity,
greater spirituality

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:84%
with wonderful tools like sacred
geometry, advanced technologies.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So I get that you really hold a
lot of that even in this life So

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
kind of saying,
you're very infinite.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
You can't even put a number
on how many lives it is.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But as an Andromedan, as
an Arcturian, as a Sirian.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:22:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But that Arcturian aspect of
helping to rewrite, rewire,

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of ways, our world.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Unprogram, deprogram, our world,
that's a lot of the kind of work

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:90%
that you've come to do.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways you've come
to do it by inventing new.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you are doing
that, is that a reading

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.890 align:middle line:84%
or where's that
information flowing?

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Yes, so I call
that an Akashic reading.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:10%
And earlier on in the
session with that gentleman,

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:10%
I used a vibrational key to
energetically open the door

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:10%
into his Akashic library.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And then he was asking
me different questions,

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and I was answering
his, where am I

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.770 align:middle line:84%
from, galactically
type of question.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: And so I hear them.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very clairaudient.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:90%
I usually see some images.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of information comes
through claircognizantly.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.970 align:middle line:84%
It's that very
clear knowingness.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm basically
just speaking

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:84%
what I'm hearing,
feeling, seeing, to him.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can he
use the information

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:90%
you give him to better himself?

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So we were also
working with part

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:90%
of purpose, what's his purpose.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And I always like
people to realize

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:90%
that we have many purposes.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Even if we live 60,
70, 80, 90 years,

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
there is so much to
do in that much time.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And so he really
was here in part

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to work with helping humanity to
awaken through energetic means.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And so he's working
by creating, inventing

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.290 align:middle line:84%
some new different
sorts of technology.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
he's actually doing.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So he was very validated by the
information I was giving him

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:84%
when he realized that,
oh, you're very galactic,

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and you come to help us invent
new technology for humanity.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lisa,
what is a starseed?

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So we just consider
that someone from another world,

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:06.990 align:middle line:90%
planet, plane like--

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could I be a starseed?

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely
George, you are.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could tell?

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a couple
of different things.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:84%
One is that your desire to
bring this wisdom and light

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:84%
to humanity is a big
mission for all starseeds,

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
really helping people to
awaken to new information

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:84%
to other worlds, to really start
to actualize our greater truth.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And so you are
definitely, I would

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:44.420 align:middle line:84%
say, from a much further
world like Andromeda, a very,

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:90%
very, very, very ancient soul.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't I
remember that life?

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Why is there a block here?

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
we have amnesia.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes, absolutely.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.940 align:middle line:84%
It's actually part of
the human programming.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So when we decided to
create a world where

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:84%
we could have these specific
type of human experiences,

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:84%
we actually programmed ourselves
to not remember before.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And so even though you make a
very big, complex soul plan,

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.610 align:middle line:84%
you come in, you have
complete amnesia.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:84%
We go through this whole
years of being a small child.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Although what I do
find interesting

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:84%
is that small children will
often have some kind of memory,

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:84%
around maybe two
or three or four.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But then that amnesia really
kicks in and we forget.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember the case of
James Leininger, the little boy

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
who was a World War
II pilot, and he

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:84%
remembered specific
things about what

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.230 align:middle line:90%
happened during that battle.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.640 align:middle line:84%
His plane, the tires
that would blow out

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.650 align:middle line:90%
upon landing, his crew members.

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
They took him to a
reunion years later,

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:12.580 align:middle line:84%
and he met the guys who were in
his unit, from the other life.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.400 align:middle line:90%
And he remembered who they were.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Joe.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Pete.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.855 align:middle line:90%
-

00:26:16.855 --> 00:26:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS]

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
astounded by that.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.005 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:26:21.005 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, I
would say that there

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.170 align:middle line:84%
are those rare souls who
have been on this planet,

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say,
many, many, many times.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And they actually do have
a better type of memory.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I
believe that we come

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.890 align:middle line:84%
to a point in our
human existence is,

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.830 align:middle line:84%
where we can start to
override this programming.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And even for myself,
I was awake at three.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I could remember
not being in a body.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:53.650 align:middle line:84%
I could realize, I was like,
no, I'm back in a body!

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:54.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these
past lives sometimes

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:90%
overlap, where you get confused?

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: I haven't
seen confusion,

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:84%
but there are times where
there will be two or maybe even

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:90%
three aspects of the soul.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Now the soul is huge.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And so you could
have a small aspect,

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and we just have small
aspects in our bodies.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:20.120 align:middle line:84%
You could have two or three
on the Earth at the same time.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say that
we very rarely ever bump

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.760 align:middle line:90%
into ourselves.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:30.500 align:middle line:84%
But there are times where we
may have a kind of a weird--

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and I've noticed
this in readings,

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.940 align:middle line:84%
where I'll be telling
somebody about a past life,

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and then the record keepers will
come in with another past life.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, that's weird.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Those are overlapping lives,
but same soul, two bodies

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:90%
overlapping time.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does our soul purpose
change from one lifetime

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.440 align:middle line:90%
to another?

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: I'm going to
say it does in some ways.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way the record keepers
explain the soul is often there

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:84%
are kind of specific,
more specific desires.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.300 align:middle line:90%
One soul may be very technical.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.240 align:middle line:84%
They may come back
again and again

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.840 align:middle line:84%
in technical aspects
and creating new things

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and really living in that more,
maybe physical, technical world.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Someone else may be very
much about the meditation,

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.770 align:middle line:84%
the vibration,
more like a sound,

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and they may come in much
more in meditative type lives.

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have an overview
energy of a soul,

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.700 align:middle line:84%
but we like to come and
play in every arena.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So we literally come and do
everything, from being a farmer,

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:52.100 align:middle line:84%
to living in caves,
to being often,

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:57.360 align:middle line:84%
spiritual meditators, often
having lives in government.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.830 align:middle line:84%
We do it all because most of us
live 500 to 800 lifetimes here

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.160 align:middle line:90%
on Earth alone.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes the
Akashic Record readings

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.790 align:middle line:84%
can offer advice about your
career path, the direction

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.350 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go
in our current life.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at an
example of that.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CALDWELL: What I was
told is that living design

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:90%
is a substrate.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And as we collaborate with
many, the flavors of how

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.890 align:middle line:84%
it can move out into
the world, whether it's

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:84%
in the agricultural
community, whether it's

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.720 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual
community, whether it's

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.750 align:middle line:84%
in the technological
community or the business

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:44.680 align:middle line:84%
community or the holistic
healing community,

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:84%
it allows for this connection
that you're talking about--

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yes.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CALDWELL: --to bridge
this net of golden light.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that's-- do you have any
suggestions about next steps?

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Yeah.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So what they just showed me,
which is funny but really cool,

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:16.680 align:middle line:84%
is that they say, you
will have so much support

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:84%
from all of these
different walks of life.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you'll meet people
who will bring the work

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:90%
into every different area.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And then what they showed
me was your little house kit

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:90%
in every hardware store.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.050 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CALDWELL: OK.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.000 align:middle line:90%
We'll get from here to there.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Somehow the mystery
is unfolding.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Right.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's just like growing and
growing in different areas.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's that kind
of energetic process.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you're meeting
some people who have names

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and who have probably
some great places

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:09.520 align:middle line:84%
to connect you up for the
next marketing person.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Or how do I market more
to the general public

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:84%
because it will help your
house and all the EMFs

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and all of the things that
many, many, many people are

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:90%
worried about?

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.988 align:middle line:84%
They might not care about
a golden grid, but--

00:31:23.988 --> 00:31:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CALDWELL: You're right.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.613 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: --they
care about the EMFs.

00:31:26.613 --> 00:31:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we're speaking
to those people

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:32.770 align:middle line:84%
to help them heal their
home and keep their children

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and their families
and their pets safe.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.610 align:middle line:90%
So really that aspect.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the spiritual people

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.920 align:middle line:84%
who are maybe more
about, yes, that,

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:90%
but I see the golden grids.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.910 align:middle line:90%
I see that energy expanding.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it
expanding, but it's

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.970 align:middle line:84%
connecting and interweaving
and intertwining.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So that it is really
creating this grid

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:01.590 align:middle line:84%
around the world, which will
activate more and more grids.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And so being pieces of how
do you awaken a humanity.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the important pieces,

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:90%
this work that you're doing.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Akashic
records, do they always give

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:90%
advice about your career path?

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well,
people get to ask

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.880 align:middle line:90%
their own specific questions.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And so you actually can access
the soul of your business.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So if someone has their own
business like this woman does,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.960 align:middle line:84%
then she can ask about the soul
of her business, the business

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.170 align:middle line:84%
path, maybe even
sometimes, information

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.180 align:middle line:84%
like what's coming
through, and marketing,

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:90%
and different aspects.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But of course,
most of my clients

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:84%
come for personal readings
because they're maybe

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.300 align:middle line:84%
interested in knowing more
about their relationships

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:58.280 align:middle line:84%
with their parents, their
children, their best friends

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.132 align:middle line:90%
or what their purposes are.

00:33:00.132 --> 00:33:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost
like you're psychic.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [LAUGHS] Well,
it's a different realm.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So the thing with
being psychic is

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.260 align:middle line:84%
there's very much of this
life, this energy field,

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.630 align:middle line:84%
higher self to higher
self-communication.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, that is
in play with the Akasha.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Although the Akasha
is the Library

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.390 align:middle line:84%
of your soul's journey
through all time space,

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:84%
not just this more realm, this
body, which is a little bit more

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.400 align:middle line:90%
of the psychic realm.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the Akashic
Records are primarily

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.380 align:middle line:84%
aimed at the record-keeping
of your soul path

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning of time.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.453 align:middle line:90%
Am I correct?

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Absolutely.

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.955 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what it is.

00:33:44.955 --> 00:33:45.755 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:33:45.755 --> 00:33:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had 1,000 souls,
those lives would be in that

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.380 align:middle line:90%
book.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Yes, there
would be 1,000 libraries.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Every single soul has
its own Akashic library

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and its own set
of a half a dozen

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.500 align:middle line:84%
or a dozen Akashic
Record keepers.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So you've got your own library,
as do I and every one of those

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.010 align:middle line:90%
1,000 people.

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Instead of just being
a name in a book,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.600 align:middle line:90%
they would have a library.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what happens
if things just fall apart

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:90%
when life collapses around us?

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.770 align:middle line:90%
What's causing that?

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: So it's
interesting, because we

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:84%
are such ancient and
infinite souls, that we often

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.909 align:middle line:84%
come to learn either a
challenging lesson, which

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.400 align:middle line:84%
is possible to be
around your health

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:84%
or maybe your business
collapses or possibly we're

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.520 align:middle line:84%
a place in the
world where there's

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.630 align:middle line:90%
an earthquake or a flood.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes life
really falls apart.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:49.429 align:middle line:84%
And there are times
where, again, there's

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:51.780 align:middle line:90%
collective contracts.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So there are areas
in the world that

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.370 align:middle line:84%
may have a collective
contract about being part

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:03.860 align:middle line:84%
of a big earthquake and
how they come together

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and how they fix it and how they
rebuild and how they go forward.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And so as infinite souls, we
really have plans about many

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:15.750 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And really, the
record keepers say

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.110 align:middle line:84%
the important piece
is that instead

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:84%
of falling into a space
of feeling like a victim,

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.810 align:middle line:84%
instead of falling
into that energy of,

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.880 align:middle line:90%
my town has been destroyed--

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.330 align:middle line:84%
of course that's
traumatic and terrible.

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:40.180 align:middle line:84%
But again, how can we
recreate it better?

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.130 align:middle line:84%
What can we do different
so that everyone is living

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.030 align:middle line:90%
in a healthier, safer place?

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Where can we build?

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And so there's information
in your Akashic Records

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that helps you to understand why
you might pick that scenario,

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.250 align:middle line:84%
why you would put that
challenge in your life

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.600 align:middle line:90%
and how you can come out of it.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:84%
It really may be with
greater ease and grace.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does it
do to us as individuals?

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Do we become better when
we access the records?

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: [CHUCKLES] I would
say we can become better.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or we
should become better.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:21.361 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: Well, it's a
process, and we are human.

00:36:21.361 --> 00:36:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you access the
Akashic records-- so most of us

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.590 align:middle line:84%
humans live in a
very emotional world.

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Much of the planet lives--

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.620 align:middle line:84%
if you looked at a
vibrational scale,

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.200 align:middle line:84%
like Dr. David
Hawkins used to talk

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.680 align:middle line:84%
about in power versus force,
the scale of 0 to 1000.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of humanity is
around 50, 100, 150, 200.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.450 align:middle line:84%
We live in a very low
vibrational, low frequency

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:53.510 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And when we open
our records, we're

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:03.440 align:middle line:84%
actually moving into the energy
of love and grace and peace.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.380 align:middle line:84%
That's where the Akashic
Records are stored.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So we literally get
that healing energy.

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:14.670 align:middle line:84%
We get to spend time in the
energy of pure source love.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.180 align:middle line:84%
We get to receive the
information and wisdom

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.850 align:middle line:84%
from our Akashic
Record keepers who

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:24.090 align:middle line:84%
are sharing with us how
to transform our lives,

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.570 align:middle line:90%
how to create a better world.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:90%
And so it really does.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:35.670 align:middle line:84%
If we use the Akashic
access as a process,

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:84%
if it's something we do on a
regular basis for ourselves

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand our lives,
who we are, why we've come,

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.460 align:middle line:84%
what we've come to, maybe how
we've come to support humanity,

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.710 align:middle line:84%
we really do eventually
start to see the world really

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:56.740 align:middle line:84%
through brighter eyes,
through more love and grace.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And so it can be very, very
emotionally and energetically

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:04.210 align:middle line:90%
transformative.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lisa, what
is quantum healing?

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: The Akashic Records
are part of the quantum field

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So we know that everything
is part of quantum.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Source is part of quantum.

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And so what I see in
the Akashic Records

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:84%
is that when we move into this
beautiful, high vibrational

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.390 align:middle line:84%
energy, we're actually
moving more consciously

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:32.260 align:middle line:84%
into this expanded
quantum void, which

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.890 align:middle line:84%
is a space of,
actually, nothingness,

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.540 align:middle line:90%
but of infinite possibilities.

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And so in that space of the
quantum void, where everything

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.150 align:middle line:84%
is possible, where we
can create from nothing,

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:50.650 align:middle line:84%
we actually can recreate
some of the lives,

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe where we
made a big mistake.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.970 align:middle line:84%
We can learn and grow around
some of these challenges.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:84%
We can release some of the
emotional, just the pain

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.050 align:middle line:90%
and challenges that we've had.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And so in this beautiful quantum
void space of source energy,

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:84%
we can start to
transform ourselves.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your client asked you
once at the end of a session,

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.150 align:middle line:84%
if she had cleared her
internal blockages.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen in on
that answer from you.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CALDWELL: Have I
cleared any blocks

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:32.400 align:middle line:84%
that could need to be cleared
for the safety of myself

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and living design,
moving forward?

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:42.170 align:middle line:90%


00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BARNETT: Beautiful question.

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just watching
all of this energy

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:53.310 align:middle line:84%
as we were even
speaking about it.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:59.570 align:middle line:84%
The flow from the center,
right from the heart of Gaia,

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm watching it wash up
right through the planet,

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:07.640 align:middle line:84%
through you, your heart,
your head, your mind.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Really all of that
just expanding up

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:15.620 align:middle line:84%
into the higher realms,
your higher self and on

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and really just releasing any
old worries, stories, fear.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Just see that just
dissipating, just like a fog

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:36.920 align:middle line:84%
would dissipate from the Earth
as you breathe into your heart.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And know that you truly
are an ancient soul

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.420 align:middle line:84%
with divine guidance and
wisdom and amazing talents

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.080 align:middle line:90%
to help at this time.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And so it looks really
clear and smooth.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit of the old
energy just dropping away.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, yes, you
are clear, you are ready,

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.790 align:middle line:90%
you are in service.

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, discernment is
always part of the process.

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people might show
up, and they're excited but not

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.190 align:middle line:90%
quite ready.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's a timing
issue, a little divine timing.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:28.865 align:middle line:84%
But you are, and you know
it's really their message.

00:41:28.865 --> 00:41:32.180 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CALDWELL: What a gift!

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.360 align:middle line:90%
What a gift!

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she's
right, what a gift.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:84%
These records that you
tap into, etherically

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.730 align:middle line:90%
speaking, where are they?

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: You're part of
source, which is not a place.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:53.730 align:middle line:84%
It is certainly not part of
this time-space continuum.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what I've
seen is that there

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:02.210 align:middle line:84%
used to be some physical forms
of the Akasha on the planet,

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.340 align:middle line:84%
like in ancient Egypt,
underneath the Sphinx.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:12.000 align:middle line:84%
But all of those have
been, whatever, depleted.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the Akasha
is in source energy,

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.010 align:middle line:84%
in this quantum
field of the all.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, they have been
in the Library of Alexandria,

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:23.580 align:middle line:90%
and hence it burned down.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe somebody was trying
to do something heinous.

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: There
is a possibility.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe, that some
of those, Alexandria,

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.950 align:middle line:84%
there's a place
also in Egypt where

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:40.760 align:middle line:84%
I went to see the Serapeum,
which had actually

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.260 align:middle line:84%
spaces in the wall,
like they were books.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into
that space, and I just

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:51.270 align:middle line:84%
had huge energetic downloads
of the information that

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:53.530 align:middle line:90%
had been stored in that space.

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe it was held
on Earth in a variety of ways

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:03.190 align:middle line:84%
to help us as we were continuing
forward after the Ice Age.

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
older than the Ice Age.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it
important for an individual

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.750 align:middle line:90%
to access their Akashic records?

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BARNETT: It gives
you really the ability

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:18.960 align:middle line:84%
to know who you are as the
infinite soul that you are.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, the
experience of seeing

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:27.300 align:middle line:84%
past lives in which I was part
of an ancient mystery school,

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and I did have some
lives in also in Egypt

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and in Persia and China, and
many of these lives, very

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.310 align:middle line:90%
ancient lives.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:41.160 align:middle line:10%
I know I was part of
the Druid community

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:44.470 align:middle line:10%
at some point in Scotland,
a very long time ago.

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:48.420 align:middle line:10%
So it helps us to
actually embody

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:53.310 align:middle line:10%
the wisdom and the energy that
is held in our Akashic Records,

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:56.790 align:middle line:10%
so that we can integrate
it into our physical body

00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:00.720 align:middle line:10%
and start to energetically
remember and access

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.940 align:middle line:10%
that information.

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your website
