00:00:24.278 --> 00:00:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Lauren Cielo back with us,
a clairvoyant healer, teacher,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:10%
and author who helps people tap
into their own special gifts

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:10%
and gain back energy that
they might have lost.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Lauren, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN CIELO: Thanks, George.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.278 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for inviting me.

00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I continue
to get great response

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:84%
from your appearances in
previous "Beyond Belief" shows.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.447 align:middle line:84%
So do you still get that
reciprocal response too?

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Even from the very first
show back in, I think, 2013?

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.843 align:middle line:90%
Yes, way back.

00:00:52.843 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's great.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Thank you.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.502 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
clairvoyant healer?

00:00:57.502 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: Well,
think of other types

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:10%
of healers in this industry,
like maybe a massage therapist

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:10%
or a Reiki master.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.980 align:middle line:10%
They can't really see the energy
that they're trying to move.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.550 align:middle line:10%
So by turning on
your third eye, you

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:10%
can actually see what you're
trying to shift and know

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:10%
if it does shift or not.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's something
more important than that.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
just seeing someone,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:90%
to witness someone.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when that
happens, the person

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:90%
starts to shift and change.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
We call it like a spirit
to spirit hello or namaste,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the god in me sees
the god in you.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that's the
most powerful healing.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the person
who is being healed

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:90%
have to be a believer?

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: No, and they don't
even have to know they're

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:90%
being healed.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.987 align:middle line:84%
You can do this without them
knowing what's going on?

00:01:44.987 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that work?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, the contract,
if we thought of it

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that way, that I have with
the person that I'm working on

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:84%
is really with
their higher self.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So if they make it
all the way to where

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.787 align:middle line:84%
I'm casting my clairvoyant
awareness on them,

00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:90%
then there's already a contract.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I would never
be motivated to do it.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So them here on Earth, they
may not know I'm doing it,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:90%
but their higher self does.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go all the way
back when you were a child.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:90%
Did you have this ability?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Gosh no.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did not.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:90%
So it came later in life?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I'm trained
I'm formally trained.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to be
shown how to do it.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.408 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who trained you?

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I was trained at the
Psychic Institute in San Diego.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So the teaching
that I was taught

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.852 align:middle line:84%
and that I teach other people
all over the world, teachers

00:02:29.852 --> 00:02:31.060 align:middle line:90%
all over the world, for sure.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.477 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
have an epiphany?

00:02:32.477 --> 00:02:34.135 align:middle line:84%
What made you get
into that field?

00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: No, I tricked
myself into it.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yes, of course
I was an engineer.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a flyer at Whole
Foods for a Psychic Institute.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.967 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A flyer at Whole Foods.

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And that's what
started this whole thing.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So I never thought I
would leave engineering.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.640 align:middle line:90%
I was 44 years old.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.590 align:middle line:90%
You don't leave a career at 44.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So I was playing with
this psychic technique

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:90%
and I got laid off.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.808 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, maybe I should
try to hang out my shingle.

00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was your calling.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: So I did, and the rest
is history, with your help.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us a little
bit about how it works.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: OK, so I think the
words are deceiving, George.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.270 align:middle line:84%
When I say that I see energy,
that's not the right word.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:84%
To see means that
photons are hitting

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:90%
the optic nerves of my eyes.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
not the way it is.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.368 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: That's not it.

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is energy
is hitting my third eye.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So probably the closest I could
compare it to is dreaming.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
know how a blind person

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:90%
can see by touching.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:84%
They can't obviously
see with their eyes.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:90%
They're blind.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But when they touch
a face or an object,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:90%
they can see it in their mind.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.725 align:middle line:84%
Is that a little bit
like what you do?

00:03:47.725 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: That's exactly it.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And the mind's eye, I always
wonder why do we have it?

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Why do Homo sapiens--
why can they

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:90%
imagine an image in their mind?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it's
really important.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I think probably
before we could even

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
speak, before we
evolved into language,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
that we were communicating by
showing each other pictures--

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:90%
telepathy.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, the cave people would
make etchings on cave walls.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: The abstract
ability to think.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does everybody
have this ability or can

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:90%
they have this ability?

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Well, I think so.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But if you're raised around
people who never walk upright,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:90%
then you don't walk upright.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a lot
more that human beings can do

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:90%
but they just don't realize it.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:90%
So I think everybody can do it.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I could give you
a little demonstration.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Excellent.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:90%
So if you could close your eyes.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And then just like a child does,
imagine out in front of you,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, let's
say a yellow circle.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And it may not look to
yellow and it may not

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
look too much like a
circle, but right now

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
that's how your clairvoyance
sees a yellow circle.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And then next to it, maybe
you'll imagine a blue triangle.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And it may not look
too blue and it may not

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:84%
look too much like a
triangle, but right now

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that's how your
clairvoyance sees it.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the trick.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Would you now please allow--

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and we'll say the supreme
being, the highest

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:90%
energy that you recognize.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Would you allow
the supreme being

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to create, I don't know,
let's say, a green oval.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may not look
too green and it may not

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
look too much like an
oval, but right now

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:90%
that's how you see it.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So the difference between
the first two shapes

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and the third shape is
you created the first two,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
but you read an image
that somebody else created

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:90%
in the third one.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So you have to kind of get used
to what your clairvoyance looks

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.143 align:middle line:90%
So practice helps.

00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was going to say.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.967 align:middle line:84%
The more you do it,
the better you get.

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I think so.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a muscle.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clairvoyancey--
there are four clairs

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.500 align:middle line:90%
that people refer to.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well it's
claircognizance,

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.030 align:middle line:90%
which is the crown chakra.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.863 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's one.

00:06:05.863 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Clairvoyance,
clairaudience,

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.737 align:middle line:90%
and clairsentience.

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And which one
is the most important

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.487 align:middle line:84%
or do they all work in
tandem with each other?

00:06:14.487 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: They actually
do work in tandem.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:84%
When I'm reading somebody,
I use the upper three.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:90%
So I'll get information.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it's what's
easiest for me to pick up.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So can we do another
little example?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: OK, so let's pick a--

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do I have to
close my eyes again?

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.515 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: If you want to,
or you can keep them open.

00:06:32.515 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's pick the
Archangel Michael.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's say you want
to talk to Michael.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's best to start by asking
questions of him about him.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:90%
See what he says.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: About
Archangel Michael?

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, and then once
you get a communication channel

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:84%
with him, then you can
start asking about you.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's say right
now that you're

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
going to ask the
Archangel Michael what's

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:90%
his favorite color.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And then notice how
you got that color.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Something came to you.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.208 align:middle line:90%
Did you see it?

00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it remote viewing?

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Did you hear it
or did you just know it?

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And then let's say you ask
him, if you had a favorite day

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:90%
of the week, which would it be?

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, everybody watching
this got a day of the week,

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.593 align:middle line:90%
but how did you get it?

00:07:18.593 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Did you know it, did you
see it, or did you hear it?

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that with
a being that you know--

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows
Archangel Michael--

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.540 align:middle line:84%
then you start to
get your confidence.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, oh, when I talk
to Michael, I hear his answers.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So now that I got that down,
I'm going to ask about me.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's really not
difficult at all.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I think the only
thing that holds

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:84%
people back is they don't
trust what they're getting.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the "Open
Minds" Gaia program,

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:84%
intuitive Mariana Cooper
talked about an exercise

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:84%
that people can do to
establish what you're talking

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:90%
about this clair ability.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:10%
>>MARIANA COOPER: We're all
born with all four clairs.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:10%
So we're born with the
capacity to all of them,

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:10%
but we usually have what I
call one screensaver clair.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.550 align:middle line:10%
One default, one that
we kind of naturally--

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:10%
and one of the best examples
that was taught to me

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:10%
is to ask yourself, when
you go to a movie, what

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:10%
do you remember the most?

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:10%
So when you walk
out of the movie,

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:10%
do you first comment
on the relationship

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:10%
that the characters were having?

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:10%
Do you first comment on
the score or the music?

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:10%
Are you the one who always
knows the set, the curtains,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:10%
and the furniture?

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:10%
Or are you the one who knew the
end of the movie before it got

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:10%
started?

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:10%
From the beginning,
you knew the end.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.490 align:middle line:10%
If you're the type
that looks at the set,

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:10%
you're more likely
that you're defaulting

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:10%
on clairvoyance, your visual.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:10%
If you remember the score,
and that's how you are moved,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:10%
clairaudience is
your dominant clair.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:10%
If you knew the end of
the movie before the end,

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.850 align:middle line:10%
your claircognizance,
kind of that knowing,

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:10%
was your dominant clair.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:10%
And if you were sobbing
and thoroughly involved

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:10%
in the relationship
with the characters,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:10%
that's your clairsentience.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.350 align:middle line:10%
So when you know what
that dominant clair is--

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: That's
a good little exercise

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:10%
for people to go away
with and think about.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:10%
And then you know what
to start looking for.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:10%
Yeah no, that's very
good distinction.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.865 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes you're
all of the above.

00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:11.990 align:middle line:10%
>>COOPER: Eventually, you
do have all of the above.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.782 align:middle line:10%
So if you want to be
a professional channel

00:09:13.782 --> 00:09:16.835 align:middle line:10%
or professional at this,
you do develop all four.

00:09:16.835 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:10%
And that's how when
you go to a psychic

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:10%
or a professional intuitive,
that's what they're doing.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:10%
They're using all four.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.608 align:middle line:10%
They may say, oh,
I'm a clairvoyant.

00:09:25.608 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:10%
When they sit with you
or they're listening

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:10%
to you on the phone, they're
getting all four about you

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:10%
in some way, shape, or form and
just concentrate on the one.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: And is
that the case with you?

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:10%
>>COOPER: Yes.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.250 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: That's
all of the above.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COOPER: Yeah.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lauren, if
Mariana is correct,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:84%
if people have the ability
to capture all four

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
of these so-called clairs,
what does that make you?

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's got
to make you pretty

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.543 align:middle line:84%
proficient in the
clairvoyant field.

00:09:49.543 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Well I'll tell you.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
What I think is all
of us are picking up

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:84%
the very same
information, but it's

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.790 align:middle line:84%
about where your
awareness is pointed.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So the more you start-- and
it's very subtle, George.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
It's much more
subtle than anything

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:90%
here on the Earth plane.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.275 align:middle line:84%
So you got to catch
it when it's hot.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm reading
somebody, I already

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.817 align:middle line:84%
know the answer to the
question before they're

00:10:12.817 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:90%
done phrasing the question.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:20.273 align:middle line:84%
So it comes fast and
it's really easy to do.

00:10:20.273 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could just sit
everybody down and show them

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.565 align:middle line:84%
their clairvoyance the way
somebody showed me mine.

00:10:24.565 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it like intuition?

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I do think
that intuition is probably

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:84%
a word that describes
all four of the clairs.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:84%
But what I think the biggest
difference for the viewers

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:84%
is to think of intuition
as opposed to logic.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So if I was teaching a
logic class like calculus,

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:84%
the student would have
one correct answer,

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:84%
out of all of the things
in the world, one number.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But in intuition, there's
never just one answer.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a while for
our logical left brain

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.362 align:middle line:90%
to catch on to that.

00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
are afraid, when

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.358 align:middle line:84%
they read other people, that
they're going to get it wrong,

00:11:06.358 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:84%
but know what you're
going to pick up

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:84%
is what that person
needs to hear.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's never
just one answer.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.390 align:middle line:90%
There's many.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do most people
know they have this ability?

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I didn't.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You didn't?

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely not.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you think it
was just part of your being?

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I think until
somebody sat me down and talked

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
me through it step by
step, and then said, OK,

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
what are you
experiencing now, Lauren?

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:90%
What are you picking up?

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh my gosh, I
am picking something up.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And once the person
who was teaching me

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.680 align:middle line:84%
validated it for me, then
I'm like, this is it?

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:90%
This is what clairvoyance is?

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.688 align:middle line:90%
This is super easy.

00:11:45.688 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
the signs out there

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:84%
for people to realize
they have this ability?

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think, first of
all, desire to have it grow,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.880 align:middle line:84%
to learn more about it,
because we're all clairvoyant.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
We just don't realize that we're
picking up that information.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that
probably most of us

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
are more used to
the other clairs.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Like when you think
of a song and you

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.080 align:middle line:84%
turn on the radio,
that kind of thing.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think personally that
clairvoyance is a little bit

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
more, I don't know-- maybe
you need help to perfect it.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.075 align:middle line:84%
To really trust
what you're seeing.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To polish it?

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.647 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah, to polish it.

00:12:23.647 --> 00:12:24.870 align:middle line:90%
That's the word.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, but once you
do, you can do amazing things

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:90%
with that stuff.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I still
freak myself out.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things
I see, sometimes I

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
think, well, maybe I
shouldn't comment on that.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I kind of
get hung up on it.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, OK I got to say it.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I say it, the
person goes, oh my gosh,

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.960 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe you knew that.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:90%
And I can't believe it either.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm just doing the same
thing I do all the time

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:90%
the way I was trained.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It's very much like
a sport or maybe even

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
a military exercise where
you just train over and over.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So you're just really
doing the same thing.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But the way the
person reacts to it

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.138 align:middle line:90%
is always kind of surprising.

00:13:02.138 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you had
this gift for a long time.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:90%
You just didn't realize it.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:84%
You didn't look at the
signs that were there,

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.363 align:middle line:84%
and probably you're more
tuned into that now.

00:13:12.363 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And maybe
I didn't really

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:90%
think of it as a valuable tool.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:90%
What would I do with it?

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a good
hunch thing though too.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:84%
To have this ability, you can
use it in your everyday life.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Well,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think the great
thing about being clairvoyant

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
is it takes your awareness
from the daily things that

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
are going on and it
gives you a bigger

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:90%
overarching understanding.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a good example.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I do end of the year
readings, like helping

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.000 align:middle line:84%
people look at the
energy for the next year.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And so when our lives
changed so quickly

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of 2020, I
went back to those readings.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:90%
So what was I picking up?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.400 align:middle line:90%
And

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.982 align:middle line:84%
I do remember a very
interesting energy

00:13:59.982 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:84%
that kept showing up
on people's readings

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.470 align:middle line:90%
that I'd never seen before.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was a global
community healer.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:84%
That the people I was reading
would be needed for some reason

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to heal their
community or the world.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And I never saw that in
those readings before.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:84%
They might do healings
with their family or maybe

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.132 align:middle line:84%
a professional healer, but
nothing on a worldwide scale.

00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So when I went back
and looked, I'm

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
like that's the shift
that we're living through.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.410 align:middle line:84%
But the way I saw it wasn't
that something terrible

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.560 align:middle line:84%
No, you're going to
get a chance to be

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:90%
a healer to the entire planet.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
clairvoyance does.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
It might take the nitty
gritty of the day,

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
but then puts it into a really
big tapestry that you can maybe

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:84%
get a better understanding of
your role in what's coming up.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that
trauma accentuates this or does

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.852 align:middle line:84%
it diminish it, the
ability to be clairvoyant?

00:14:56.852 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Well, I'll say this.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that people
that go into it,

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.530 align:middle line:84%
that search out this type of
ability, have been traumatized.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:90%
It's the wounded healer.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Something has to
motivate you in your life

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to seek out more than just
what you see in front of you,

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.400 align:middle line:90%
and that's usually trauma.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I do think that
people who have been hurt--

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.697 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we write
those contracts, to be hurt.

00:15:18.697 --> 00:15:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the big
question about trauma

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:84%
is there's a rocket scientist
and self-help author, Olympia

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:84%
LePoint, who talks about
trauma and its ability

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.082 align:middle line:90%
to really magnify clairvoyancey.

00:15:31.082 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:10%
>>OLYMPIA LEPOINT:
What trauma does

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:10%
is it turns off our
frontal brain lobes.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:90%
It freezes it up.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.695 align:middle line:90%
So take a simple example.

00:15:39.695 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
studying mathematics

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.768 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
how to do it--

00:15:42.768 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Brain freeze.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.010 align:middle line:10%
>>LEPOINT: Brain freeze.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:10%
And you're like, oh my god.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.412 align:middle line:10%
And that was the reason
why I wrote my first book

00:15:48.412 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:10%
"Mathaphobia" was
because there's

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:10%
so many kids freezing
their brain when

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.860 align:middle line:10%
they go to mathematics.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:10%
But then amplify
that 1,000 times.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.430 align:middle line:10%
Whenever we go through
a stressful situation,

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:10%
our brain freezes
up 1,000 times more.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:10%
And it's like paralyzing.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:10%
And so we have a couple
of different responses.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.740 align:middle line:10%
And so when I was
writing this book,

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:10%
I was really
writing it because I

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.960 align:middle line:10%
wanted to understand
how I got through this.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:10%
And the science, it
was fascinating to me

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:10%
because I didn't know how I
overcame these situations.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.060 align:middle line:10%
And I was like, how could I
explain this to somebody else

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.450 align:middle line:10%
so they can overcome
their situations too.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.820 align:middle line:10%
And the only way that
I knew how to do it

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:10%
is to apply the math to it.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:10%
And what I realized is
that we have a brain flow.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:10%
It connects us.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:10%
Our frontal brain lobes connect
to our striatum in our brain,

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:10%
and brain connects
us to our body.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:10%
And not only that,
our brain connects us

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:10%
to this outside world, this
gigantic field around us

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.998 align:middle line:10%
that we have this
power to walk in.

00:16:57.998 --> 00:17:00.040 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: And the way
you put it, after trauma,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:10%
the brain can either go into
shutdown mode and freeze

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:10%
or you can go to
rapid expansion mode,

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:10%
but it really becomes a
matter of will and choice.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.040 align:middle line:10%
And talk about how this
complex works together now.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:10%
>>LEPOINT: Thank you so much.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:10%
I created a term
called the triabrain.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.869 align:middle line:10%
It is a three-sided brain.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:21.609 align:middle line:10%
It's the left,
right, and center.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:23.859 align:middle line:10%
And the left side
is very logical,

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:10%
what I've been doing for
years with the science

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:10%
and technology,
engineering, mathematics.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:10%
The right side is
very expressive,

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:10%
the ability to public
speak and to be

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:10%
out there and share messages.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.165 align:middle line:10%
But going through my
mother's situation

00:17:36.165 --> 00:17:38.332 align:middle line:10%
and going through all that,
I've realized that there

00:17:38.332 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:10%
was a faith side of the brain.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:10%
That will, that drive,
that part of you

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:10%
that comes out in
the middle of chaos.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.970 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: The divine
expression of self.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LEPOINT: Yeah.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And that part is
embedded in the brain.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly, a
scientist's interpretation.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Wow, that was
really interesting.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably why
I'm clairvoyant, the trauma.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you
don't go through trauma?

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.113 align:middle line:90%
Do you miss something?

00:18:05.113 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:90%
Do you lose something?

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: You know what, I
think we're all traumatized.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Even being born is a trauma.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
trauma-- being born.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:84%
So comfortable for nine months,
and then here we are, right?

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: It's downhill
from there, some might say.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.263 align:middle line:84%
So I think all of us
have been traumatized.

00:18:23.263 --> 00:18:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on whether we
want to pull it out and take

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.450 align:middle line:90%
a look at it or not.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody has
had some past traumas, how

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.423 align:middle line:84%
can clairvoyance
help them heal that?

00:18:35.423 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well when
I read, there's

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.630 align:middle line:90%
really only two things I see.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
energy that looks

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:84%
like a color or information
that looks like little images.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's all you are.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So if I use my
clairvoyance, I can

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.770 align:middle line:84%
see where you're
traumatized and it's just

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:90%
little pieces of information.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So then I switch over
to be the healer,

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and I send Ankaijia,
the healing master,

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.970 align:middle line:84%
in to start to try to remove
all of them from your field.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably easiest to
think of a clairvoyant healing

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:90%
as a talk therapy on steroids.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
go to talk therapy,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.365 align:middle line:84%
you're describing one of
those pictures, your trauma.

00:19:12.365 --> 00:19:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're telling
it to somebody else.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And you're releasing
a lot of energy.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Until finally, when
you look at that event,

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.772 align:middle line:90%
you're not hurt anymore.

00:19:20.772 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
to go to therapy.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Or you could just have a
clairvoyant healer take

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.202 align:middle line:90%
that information out of you.

00:19:27.202 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to look at it.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:90%
It was there, now it's gone.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So a lot of concern
with people nowadays,

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:84%
people are upset about just
about everything, Lauren.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And how did they get through
this without falling apart?

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think
bigger pictures.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again, that's
what clairvoyance does,

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.310 align:middle line:84%
it shows you that we're not
in a dangerous situation

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
towards our extinction.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Instead, there's this
new world emerging.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And just like talking about
mothers and their children,

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
neither one of them had a great
experience during that birth,

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:09.720 align:middle line:84%
but what comes after it
enriches their life forever.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:90%
So we're on the forward lean.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:84%
It may feel like we're back
on our heels but we are not.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take of all of this.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:84%
How long have we
had clairvoyancey?

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Since the beginning of mankind?

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.653 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Before language.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it a gift from God?

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think it's
built into the design.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's my body that's
psychic, not my awareness, not

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:90%
my conscious.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think
it's a natural thing?

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: If I can calm Lauren
down enough and stay in Lauren

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and use Lauren's chakras to
read, then it's really easy.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But if Lauren's excited
or anxious, I can't get in

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:90%
and I can't stay in.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of the
first training idea,

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.270 align:middle line:84%
is to show somebody how
to stay in their body

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.952 align:middle line:90%
and use their chakras.

00:20:58.952 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
some people who don't

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:90%
react to their clairvoyancey?

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.230 align:middle line:84%
They have it but they don't
listen to that little voice.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, I think
it's probably fear.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
When we arrive, we
arrive with information

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.810 align:middle line:90%
from all of our other lives.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
But then as we're
socialized in our society,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
there are certain things
that, again, aren't valued.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
being clairvoyant

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:90%
isn't really valued.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's pushed off to the
side, and you may not even ever

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
know that you're receiving
clairvoyant information.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.348 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an
incredible gift, though,

00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:33.240 align:middle line:84%
if you can continually
use it for just about

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:90%
everything you do.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I'm telling you,
it has changed my life.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:90%
I have learned so much.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
The people that I read,
that watch your show,

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:84%
their higher selves
are so super genius.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.180 align:middle line:90%
They're my teachers.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I've learned how the
universe works, I think.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a working model.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:84%
I think I understand better
what happens when we pass away.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I think I understand
better how we get here.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:90%
And they're the teachers.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can one
experiment with us, Lauren,

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:84%
where you can perfect it
and get better and better?

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I've thought a
lot about that, George.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.670 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I'm interested
in now is chakra settings.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So if I read
somebody's chakras--

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I usually start a reading
by scanning their chakras.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell, by the
way the chakras are set,

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:90%
what they're going to ask.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So what I think would be really
interesting is to do a research

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:84%
experiment where people
write in and tell me maybe

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.710 align:middle line:84%
they have a physical
disease or mental disease.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or bad luck.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Or bad luck, anything.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And let me read your
chakras and then tell me

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:90%
what your disease is.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I can
start to correlate,

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
oh when a Homo sapien's
chakras are set this way,

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.673 align:middle line:84%
this is likely what's going to
result. It's so fascinating.

00:22:49.673 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about the program

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:84%
you run for people to access
their psychic and clairvoyant

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:54.180 align:middle line:90%
gifts.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Thank you.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for letting me.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Well again, it all starts
with mastery of our own energy

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:84%
field, to be able to
sit inside of ourselves.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And who we are reading
is way over there.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:90%
So getting comfortable.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And that would mean to be
able to control your energy

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.150 align:middle line:90%
and your information.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm reading
you and you ask

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:84%
me to scan your body
for cancer, well Lauren

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.150 align:middle line:84%
has been told that
Lauren's probably

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:90%
going to die of cancer too.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So if I start to go, oh my
gosh, George just asked me

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:middle line:90%
about cancer, do I have it?

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, I can't read you.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.380 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I've got to keep my
energy fields set and calm.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first thing.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
most challenging part

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.830 align:middle line:84%
because the technique is
so metaphysically sound

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that it sets your energy field
to where you're basically

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:47.320 align:middle line:84%
a really neutral
psychic reading machine.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:84%
So as long as you
stay balanced--

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of tools that
help you during the reading

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:84%
if you feel you're
losing your space.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But the actual reading
of somebody else

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.240 align:middle line:84%
is very, very easy once you've
mastered your own field.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say in eight weeks--

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:90%
I teach a six month program.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.417 align:middle line:84%
In eight weeks, students
are reading fluently

00:24:06.417 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:84%
like they've been reading
their whole lives.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly amazing.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Why are some people better
than others with this ability?

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.353 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think it has to
do maybe with motivation.

00:24:17.353 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:90%
I definitely thought--

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about belief?

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Maybe belief.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, by the
time somebody gets to me

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and is asking questions
about how to get trained,

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.770 align:middle line:90%
they pretty much do believe.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some time
ago I interviewed

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:34.050 align:middle line:84%
noted author Jeffrey Mishlove
about intuitive abilities.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:90%
This guy's incredible.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.120 align:middle line:10%
Tell us, first of all, what your
gut tells you about intuition.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:10%
What is it?

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:10%
>>JEFFREY MISHLOVE: Intuition
is the natural ability

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:50.340 align:middle line:10%
of the human mind to directly
perceive reality around us.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.405 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Taught by what?

00:24:51.405 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:10%
How do we get this ability?

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: We're born with it.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.990 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is how children
learn a language, for example.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.260 align:middle line:10%
They don't go to school
to learn how to speak.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:10%
They pick it up.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:10%
It's very natural.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.930 align:middle line:10%
But as we get older, especially
as we become more schooled,

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:10%
we develop our
other capabilities.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.770 align:middle line:10%
Our logical mind takes
precedence over intuition,

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.510 align:middle line:10%
often to our own detriment.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why are some
people better at intuition

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:10%
than others?

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: Well, sometimes it's
just sort of beaten out of you.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.450 align:middle line:10%
If you're a young
boy, you probably

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.430 align:middle line:10%
remember this yourself.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.052 align:middle line:10%
Big boys don't cry.

00:25:28.052 --> 00:25:29.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'm not supposed to.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.460 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah, don't be in
touch with your inner feelings.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I think I get more
emotional the older I get,

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:10%
by the way.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah, sure.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:10%
It's because we allow ourselves
to get in touch a little more

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.540 align:middle line:10%
with the inner child,
which you could

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.865 align:middle line:10%
say that's the intuitive part.

00:25:43.865 --> 00:25:45.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How many
people, though,

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.250 align:middle line:10%
do not act on their intuition?

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.820 align:middle line:10%
And something happens to them
and they go, oh, I knew it.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.630 align:middle line:10%
I knew it.

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:52.530 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: Doesn't
that happen often?

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All the time.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:10%
>>MISHLOVE: Yeah, our culture
is heavily out of balance.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.210 align:middle line:10%
We emphasize the sensational.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:10%
We emphasize the intellect.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:10%
We emphasize emotions,
but intuition

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.222 align:middle line:10%
is the least emphasized
of our human talents.

00:26:10.222 --> 00:26:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I absolutely agree.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.280 align:middle line:84%
He said it much
better than I did.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, you do a
good job doing it too.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Thank you.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But he's into that.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, if
you have chakras--

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.792 align:middle line:84%
and everybody does--
then you're psychic.

00:26:24.792 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where are the
chakra points on our body?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: The crown, third eye,
throat, heart, solar plexus,

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.818 align:middle line:90%
second, and first.

00:26:32.818 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
chakras do we have?

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.625 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Well, seven main ones.

00:26:36.625 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And can you
tell if somebody's

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:90%
sick by feeling their chakras?

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.880 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: Well, what I could
do to feel their energy,

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.030 align:middle line:10%
either I'll step in,
and that was pretty much

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:10%
the clairsentience, where
I'll step in and go,

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:55.110 align:middle line:10%
what does this feel like
to be you right now?

00:26:55.110 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, I don't
know, moving more and more

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.160 align:middle line:84%
towards the potential
of humanity,

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.400 align:middle line:84%
of what each individual
person is capable of,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I think we have gifts that we
don't even have names for yet.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:12.960 align:middle line:90%
So more exciting stuff's coming.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it easier for
you to read other people,

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.243 align:middle line:90%
or to read yourself?

00:27:18.243 --> 00:27:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Other people.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Other people that I don't know--

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say this, but
it doesn't sound as bad

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.283 align:middle line:84%
as it really is-- that
I don't care about.

00:27:25.283 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is that I don't have

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:90%
investment in their contracts.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.070 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do this
or that, that's fine.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm neutral and I'll
read it for you.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you say
about people who say,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.950 align:middle line:90%
I knew this was going to happen.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:90%
I just knew it.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think that's
the most frustrating thing.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Well maybe this, to
know something and not

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.310 align:middle line:90%
prepare for it.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:54.613 align:middle line:84%
We all get those bolts of
information where we're like,

00:27:54.613 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, something's
going to happen,

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.610 align:middle line:84%
but not to prepare for it or
to act on that information,

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and then when it does happen,
you kind of beat yourself up.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So anytime I get that flash
of intuition on something,

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.440 align:middle line:90%
I take steps.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.630 align:middle line:84%
For example, I
adopted two kittens.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.402 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing
with the kittens.

00:28:15.402 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, I was
thinking, oh it's

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.440 align:middle line:84%
so great you're going to
get to grow up together.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And I instantly knew
that one of them

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.342 align:middle line:84%
was going to pass
really, really early.

00:28:23.342 --> 00:28:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You felt that?

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: It came crashing.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.910 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.177 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't thinking about it.

00:28:28.177 --> 00:28:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I was
like, oh my gosh, one of them

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.020 align:middle line:90%
is going to die really young.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So I loved those kittens
as much as I could

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:84%
every day until
one of them died.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:38.610 align:middle line:90%
And one did.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.527 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had a guest
on "Coast to Coast."

00:28:40.527 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:90%
His name is Joseph Gallenberger.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And he has done
experiments in Las Vegas

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:90%
with two sets of folks.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:52.290 align:middle line:84%
He has two groups, a happy
group and a very unhappy group.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me that almost
every time, the unhappy group

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:84%
leaves Las Vegas losers,
but the happy people,

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.520 align:middle line:84%
the happy go lucky people,
always seem to win.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does that have
to do with intuition

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:90%
and clairvoyancey?

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.087 align:middle line:90%
Something's going on here.

00:29:12.087 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: You know what
I really think it Is?

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it's being in
connection with your contracts.

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So if I know that my higher
self is always writing really

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
fun contracts,
like coming to Gaia

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and talking to
George Noory, then

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:84%
my perception of all
the energy in my field

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.180 align:middle line:90%
is the cup is always half full.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing connection
with my higher self.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
not in connection,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.920 align:middle line:84%
you're like, well, why
hasn't this happened for me?

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.295 align:middle line:84%
And when is this
going to happen?

00:29:45.295 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:90%
And why can I do that?

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So the energy in our
field is cup half empty.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what
you're experiencing,

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:84%
whether you win or not, you're
still not going to be happy.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you do this
self reading of your own body?

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well first of all,
I'm very aware of Lauren now,

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:90%
much more than I ever was.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.310 align:middle line:84%
More of my awareness comes
into Lauren because--

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Physically
and mentally?

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Energetically.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So if the size of me that
comes into Lauren is this big,

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.580 align:middle line:84%
now it's getting
bigger and bigger.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I feel more
comfortable in Lauren

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.960 align:middle line:84%
because I've done a
lot of energy work

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and I've tried to make
it a safe place in here.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:90%
So that helps in a lot of ways.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, to see that what's
unfolding around us

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:90%
is a miracle.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we're
on our demise.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.043 align:middle line:90%


00:30:41.043 --> 00:30:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there anything
that could go awry,

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.820 align:middle line:84%
anything that could
go wrong when you

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.573 align:middle line:90%
do this self-check of yourself?

00:30:47.573 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Probably not.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.323 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or get
misinterpreted or something?

00:30:50.323 --> 00:30:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Probably not go
awry, but you miss things.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a big problem.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.223 align:middle line:84%
It's called unconsciousness
and humans are great at it.

00:30:58.223 --> 00:30:59.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you're
talking to friends

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and they say, oh you always
do this, and you're like,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.255 align:middle line:90%
I never do that.

00:31:03.255 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And they laugh at
you because you

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:90%
don't know you always do it.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I think is
really the biggest problem,

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:84%
is that people are unconscious
to what's in their field.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So as you start to sit down
and move in and say hello

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:84%
to yourself and get
to know yourself

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:23.855 align:middle line:84%
from the seventh layer of your
aura in, then life is easier.

00:31:23.855 --> 00:31:24.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Much easier?

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Much easier.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Much.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
can you tap into this,

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.130 align:middle line:90%
whatever we're tapping into--

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: That's
a great question.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.058 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to make this work?

00:31:35.058 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I spend most
of my time stopping it.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It happens that often?

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I'm pretty much
blocked off energetically

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.620 align:middle line:90%
from everybody else.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And it started when I was on
your radio show the first time.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I think my website had 100,000
hits in an hour and I felt it.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:55.860 align:middle line:90%
I was so uncomfortable.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So I had to really
beef up my tools that

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.170 align:middle line:84%
keep me energetically
separate from other people.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the ways
that I think I'm thriving.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.422 align:middle line:84%
Since you've been doing
this, and how many

00:32:07.422 --> 00:32:08.630 align:middle line:90%
years have you been that now?

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: 15.

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 15 years?

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen a
difference with yourself?

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.510 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.310 align:middle line:90%
I have changed.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed this
trip, coming here--

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.860 align:middle line:90%
I've been here several times--

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.990 align:middle line:90%
and I'm really relaxed.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my body.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying it so much more.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're excited
about it, aren't you?

00:32:28.105 --> 00:32:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I was
excited, very excited.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Instead of thinking,
OK, this is work.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:84%
I got to do this,
step one, step two.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I'm just going
to relax and enjoy it.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And I do think that the older
we get, the better life gets.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
do we call all this?

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:84%
What Is the term for
this clairvoyant ability?

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think it's
just your natural senses.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And we've been taught
five bodies since--

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
god-given senses?

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: They're anatomy.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so when Homo
sapien was designed,

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.180 align:middle line:84%
it was designed into
the Homo sapien.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there's
nothing unusual about this?

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.105 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: No, I think it's
more unusual not to use it.

00:33:10.105 --> 00:33:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's why we've
kind of gotten ourselves

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.170 align:middle line:90%
into the situation we're in.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think animals
have this ability too?

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes, absolutely.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.197 align:middle line:84%
They can sense things sometimes
better than we, I think.

00:33:22.197 --> 00:33:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.987 align:middle line:84%
How many times your dog or
cat looking up in the corner?

00:33:25.987 --> 00:33:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's something.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: That's
something or someone.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or animals
during a tsunami.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.540 align:middle line:84%
They head for the hills
way before anybody

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.670 align:middle line:84%
has an opportunity to
know what's going on.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:38.778 align:middle line:90%
How do they sense this?

00:33:38.778 --> 00:33:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think because
their left brains aren't

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.450 align:middle line:90%
overdeveloped like ours are.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.100 align:middle line:84%
They're still much more
watching the energy

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:84%
that's moving through
them and around them.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
a survival thing.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When
somebody comes to you,

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Lauren, for a reading,
what are they looking for?

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:84%
What kind of answers
are they seeking?

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: My clients, if I
could put it in a nutshell,

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I think they want to know how
to help themselves and others

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:90%
the most.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.239 align:middle line:90%
What can they do?

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:11.000 align:middle line:84%
What one or two
steps could they do

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that would help
the most the most?

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we use
this to help the planet?

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, instead of
watching small trends,

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.471 align:middle line:84%
whether they're economic or
political or social, when

00:34:25.471 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:84%
you start to use
your clairvoyance,

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:29.540 align:middle line:84%
you're reading from
such a high perspective

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:35.060 align:middle line:84%
that you start to see Earth
history in like millennias, not

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:84%
election cycles or
fiscal quarters.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So it gives you a
much bigger view

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.090 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening to
our planet in relation

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.469 align:middle line:90%
to the whole universe.

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the one as
powerful as the many,

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.080 align:middle line:84%
or do you have to
have a group of people

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.330 align:middle line:90%
in order to change things?

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.219 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think we're
all changing things

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.960 align:middle line:90%
whether we realize it or not.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.340 align:middle line:90%
And I'll just say this.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.530 align:middle line:84%
That you would not
be on this planet

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:04.310 align:middle line:84%
right now if you hadn't
purposefully incarnated

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.910 align:middle line:90%
for the change that's coming.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you're here,
you're a light worker.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.280 align:middle line:90%
That's why you came.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
when I was younger,

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I had this feeling that
something really big

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.250 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen
in my lifetime.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what,
and I was afraid of it

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and hoped for it
at the same time.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I still feel that way.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But we're right
up against it now.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So for everybody
listening, everything

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.130 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
through has trained you,

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.200 align:middle line:84%
has made you ready for what
we're doing going forward.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So it might be best to think
that you're not depleted,

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:84%
that you're building energy
towards where we're going next.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we're right on the
cusp of a great new way

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.570 align:middle line:84%
of living together and
interacting with our planet.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's full speed ahead.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For somebody who comes
to you for training, what is it

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.690 align:middle line:84%
about what has happened
to them in their life

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:90%
to even necessitate that?

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:06.110 align:middle line:90%
What has happened to them?

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think
it's "unknowingness".

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not understanding
why things are happening.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how,
but in learning to read

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and reading for so long
and reading so many people,

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.980 align:middle line:84%
I've been able, I
think, to piece together

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:26.540 align:middle line:84%
what's really going on here
instead of, again, obsessing

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.900 align:middle line:84%
about the daily activities, like
how much money is in your bank

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.900 align:middle line:84%
or what your boyfriend
or girlfriend's doing.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So students that
come in, they want

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.220 align:middle line:84%
to see the world in a
different perspective.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're tired of the
world their parents lived in.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And we know we're
going into a new world.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So maybe people want to be
able to see that new world

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:51.200 align:middle line:90%
from a clairvoyant perspective.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And do they?

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Do they ultimately open
up their eyes to see this?

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: The biggest
thing in training someone

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is that when they finally catch
on to what clairvoyance is,

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.830 align:middle line:90%
it was just like my reaction.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.120 align:middle line:90%
This is it?

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.290 align:middle line:90%
I could totally do this.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.070 align:middle line:90%
This is so easy.

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I should have
been doing it for years.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.730 align:middle line:84%
You really can change your
life if you tap into it

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:14.653 align:middle line:90%
and do it well.

00:37:14.653 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yes, and you can
not just change your life,

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:20.900 align:middle line:90%
but change the whole creation.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much of it,
Lauren, is common sense?

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: That's a
really good question

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.340 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of times when I'm
reading, the answers they get

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.010 align:middle line:90%
are not common sense at all.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.950 align:middle line:84%
If we think of our common
sense as how our society has

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.500 align:middle line:84%
programmed us, then I
remember this one time

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
Ankaijia, and I said--

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who?

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Ankaijia.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.208 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's Ankaijia?

00:37:43.208 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: He's the spirit
guide I work with.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.900 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that does
all the heavy lifting.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.700 align:middle line:90%
I just read.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.325 align:middle line:84%
He goes over and does
all the healings.

00:37:49.325 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he a human
or is he's in the--

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, he's
an invisible person.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
we get that name?

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I'll tell you what,
it took me forever to get

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.470 align:middle line:90%
that name when I first met him.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.060 align:middle line:84%
It's actually two
names put together

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.720 align:middle line:90%
from two different lifetimes.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So once I got that, he's
very, very comical guy.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's like a
spirit guide for you?

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, his
title is healing master.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So everyone that I train
gets a healing master.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.070 align:middle line:90%
So we're the readers.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're
reading something

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and we see something
that needs to change,

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:26.470 align:middle line:84%
we send our healing
master into the image.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And we can tell how
well the healing went,

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.000 align:middle line:90%
if the energy is moved or not.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And really what's great about
it is that the healing master

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.510 align:middle line:90%
works when I don't.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'll look at you for
half an hour or an hour,

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.090 align:middle line:84%
but what's really
happening in those readings

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:45.750 align:middle line:84%
is your higher self is signing
more contracts with Ankaijia

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.390 align:middle line:84%
to walk around and follow
you on the Earth plane

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and to keep working on
whatever we saw in the reading.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So I really am just
the mouthpiece.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:55.320 align:middle line:90%
He's the healer.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you say to
somebody, Lauren, who says,

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.990 align:middle line:90%
oh come on, clairvoyancey?

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Nah, rubbish.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:03.970 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.120 align:middle line:84%
How do you change
a non-believer?

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.517 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think their
life has to change.

00:39:08.517 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:84%
The contracts that
their higher self--

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.892 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because it's
not about you, is it?

00:39:11.892 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:90%
It's about them.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So for those of us who have been
wounded, have had a hard time

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.810 align:middle line:84%
or want to understand more
about what's really happening,

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that's what drives us into
the clairvoyance and all

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.270 align:middle line:90%
the other spiritual techniques.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
dreams in clairvoyancey.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, so people have me
read their dreams all the time.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.750 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the big things.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:37.550 align:middle line:90%
I saw this dream.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.110 align:middle line:90%
Could you interpret it?

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's usually
two parts of a dream.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:46.220 align:middle line:84%
There's the part that is actual
experiences that are happening

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.150 align:middle line:84%
on the astral, and then
even in that same dream,

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:53.510 align:middle line:84%
there's daily processing of what
the Homo sapien went through

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.710 align:middle line:90%
during the day.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So to be able to
kind of pull out

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.280 align:middle line:84%
from the dream what's a real
astral experience and what's

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.920 align:middle line:90%
just kind of brain doing a dump.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And once we do that,
then the person

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.310 align:middle line:84%
understands what
part of the dream

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.710 align:middle line:84%
is really the message
and the other part that's

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:15.020 align:middle line:84%
just not to really be deciphered
or worried about maybe.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It works.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.960 align:middle line:90%
It truly does work.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.750 align:middle line:84%
What message would you like
people to take with them,

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.350 align:middle line:90%
watching this show for example?

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well I think now,
it's easiest to really optimize

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.640 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.970 align:middle line:84%
We have pushed out in
so many directions,

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:35.430 align:middle line:84%
whether it's physical
health or emotional health

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:90%
or mental or spiritual.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So now is the time
to really optimize.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I think about
optimizing human performance

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and experience, I'm
talking about it

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:50.160 align:middle line:84%
from a very granular
metaphysical standpoint where

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:55.950 align:middle line:84%
each chakra is activating and
working as well as possible.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:58.020 align:middle line:90%
And they're all optimized.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So again, I think
we haven't even

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:02.700 align:middle line:90%
tapped into what humans can do.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So we need bigger
language because we

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.343 align:middle line:84%
can't think of anything
until we have words.

00:41:07.343 --> 00:41:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's probably
a lot of gifts

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.160 align:middle line:84%
that you and I have that
go unnoticed because we

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.990 align:middle line:90%
don't have a word for them.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:16.110 align:middle line:90%
So just watch the next 20 years.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:17.930 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
some breakthroughs.

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I have clients that
are trying to bring together

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.080 align:middle line:84%
the technology of today
with all the metaphysics

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.660 align:middle line:84%
that the quantum physicists
are bringing out.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So in the next
couple decades, we

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.540 align:middle line:84%
are going to see things that,
well, our grandparents would

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:36.090 align:middle line:90%
have never thought possible.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been
in your career, what

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.270 align:middle line:84%
are the most remarkable
healing stories that you've

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.986 align:middle line:84%
come across involving
you, of course.

00:41:45.986 --> 00:41:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I had a client come
in and she had one question

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.450 align:middle line:90%
and one question only.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And the question
was, will I ever find

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.970 align:middle line:90%
happiness in this life?

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And what ended up happening with
her asking that one question is

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.450 align:middle line:90%
she decided to take my program.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.520 align:middle line:90%
She's a clairvoyant now.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:84%
She's also a real estate
agent and a wife and a mother.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And is happy?

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: She sells more
houses using her clairvoyance

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.500 align:middle line:90%
than she ever did before.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.470 align:middle line:84%
She's able to match
clients with properties,

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:21.340 align:middle line:84%
able to go into the background
to help negotiate the deals.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So this person came
to me as a woman

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.610 align:middle line:84%
who was suffering
from child abuse

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.277 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know she would
ever enjoy her life.

00:42:30.277 --> 00:42:32.110 align:middle line:84%
She was married and had
children at the time

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:33.277 align:middle line:90%
and was a real estate agent.

00:42:33.277 --> 00:42:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But not happy.

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Not happy.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.650 align:middle line:90%
And now, everything has changed.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:41.110 align:middle line:84%
She's on a forward
lean of her life.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:44.740 align:middle line:84%
She actually is
grateful for the abuse

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:47.530 align:middle line:84%
that she suffered as a child
because of where she's at now.

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's learned it.

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I couldn't imagine
a bigger shift in somebody's

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.230 align:middle line:84%
life, from going from,
will I ever be happy to

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:58.360 align:middle line:90%
will this happiness ever end.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if somebody
wants to get a hold of you,

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.850 align:middle line:84%
if they want a training program,
if they want to learn this,

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:04.780 align:middle line:90%
what do they do?

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.877 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Probably either
go to laurencielo.com.

00:43:07.877 --> 00:43:09.085 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Spell it out for us?

00:43:09.085 --> 00:43:12.880 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO:
L-A-U-R-E-N-C-I-E-L-O.com

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.890 align:middle line:10%
or goldenrosepsychic.com.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And my programs start
about every three months.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they intense?

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: They're super fun.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.910 align:middle line:90%
They're childlike.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.260 align:middle line:90%
There's no mastery.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.890 align:middle line:84%
If you think you have to
work hard, might want to--

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you do it like via
Zoom or something like that?

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Oh yes, I
don't do anything really

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.140 align:middle line:90%
live at all, everything.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.390 align:middle line:90%


00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:43.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the position
you've put me in.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Most of my clients are
all over the world.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's great.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I know.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've built that
up for you, didn't we?

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: You did.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:51.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, you deserve it.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Your message was important
to get out to people.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And I've always felt,
Lauren, that if you

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:04.840 align:middle line:84%
can help one person, not
100,000, not a million,

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.140 align:middle line:84%
but if you can help
just one, it's worth it

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.700 align:middle line:90%
because you saved the soul.

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: That's it.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.760 align:middle line:90%
And who they'll touch.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.460 align:middle line:84%
They'll do the
multiplying for you.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
certain times of the year

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:22.890 align:middle line:84%
where the clairvoyant ability
is better than another time?

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:25.650 align:middle line:84%
When things are like
jovial during Christmas,

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:28.200 align:middle line:84%
are we more clairvoyant
or it doesn't matter?

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.280 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: I haven't really
noticed a seasonal difference.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.320 align:middle line:10%
If I pulled way back
and we're looking

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.500 align:middle line:10%
at currents that were
coming through space, maybe

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.080 align:middle line:10%
through outer space hitting
the planet or energies that

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.100 align:middle line:10%
are welling up from inside
the planet coming out,

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.240 align:middle line:10%
it would probably be more
accurate to track clairvoyance

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.632 align:middle line:10%
on those cycles versus
just seasonal of the Earth.

00:44:52.632 --> 00:44:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lauren, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Gosh, thank
you so much, George.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Pleasure.

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always
fun to talk with you.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: It is.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clairvoyancey is
just an amazing ability.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.690 align:middle line:10%
We all have it.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:07.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, we need a little
training to really magnify it.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'll make a
prediction right now.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:11.640 align:middle line:90%
You're loving this show.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
