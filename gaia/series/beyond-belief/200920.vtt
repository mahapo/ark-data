>>GEORGE NOORY: One of our
special guests back with us

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:84%
on "Beyond Belief," Brooks
Agnew, a true explorer--

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
he's the author of 10 books on
the mysteries of the universe.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:10%
He has been the host of
the "X-Squared Radio"

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:10%
show for 15 years, where he has
been discussing these topics

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:10%
with a global audience.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.420 align:middle line:10%
He's also been
featured as a scientist

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:10%
on dozens of documentaries.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Brooks, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BROOKS AGNEW:
Thank you, George.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are always
doing something special.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.982 align:middle line:90%
You don't stop, do you?

00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That's
what life is about.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do great things.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My god, you've
done the Hollow Earth.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:90%
You're working on that project.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
You're working on
so many others.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've got a mission
of getting us back

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.780 align:middle line:90%
to the Moon and Mars.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.580 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.288 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: Well, I've
been interested in it

00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:10%
since I was a little kid.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:10%
In 1968, I was interviewed
by a newspaper in Southern

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:10%
California, where I lived.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me what I
wanted to be when I grew up.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't hesitate.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
I said I wanted to
be an asteroid miner.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does an
interviewer do with that?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: So the idea
that we're going

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:10%
to go beyond the
atmosphere to the Moon,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.452 align:middle line:10%
It seems like a
desert in a vacuum.

00:01:32.452 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:10%
Why are we going to go there?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:10%
I still have people
ask me that today.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Why would we go there when you
have so many problems here?

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And the benefits of going to
the Moon are just off the chain,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:84%
especially now with
our capabilities.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
We last went there with
a manned mission in 1972.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:90%
Why'd we stop?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We had actually two
more launch engines all paid

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:90%
for--

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ready to
go, ready to go--

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: With primary
and secondary crews.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%
And we decided not to go back.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Because of NASA.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:90%
NASA is an administration.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:90%
It is a bureaucracy.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And it is therefore driven by
the politics of Washington, DC.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Once space travel became blasÃ©,
if you can imagine that--

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People lost interest.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: They lost interest.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.970 align:middle line:84%
The politicians wanted
to move money elsewhere.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And they really didn't see any
benefits of continuously coming

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:90%
home with a bunch of rocks.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So they just went
another direction.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we going to
get back there, Brooks?

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, that's
a good question.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
In the past, we have
relied upon governments.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Governments raise taxes.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
They put the taxes
toward the programs.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Bureaucrats siphon
off the money.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And about 10 times over
budget, we finally get there.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Now, it's a
little bit different.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, we see the return on
investment is very, very high.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.122 align:middle line:90%
With SpaceX--

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Privatization.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.497 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: This is
a private company

00:03:07.497 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:84%
that is getting in
the space business.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:90%
And they're making money.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:84%
They're making about $4 to
$12 million profit per launch.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: This has created--

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:84%
well, it has validated
a new business model.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
going up cheaper

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.230 align:middle line:90%
than when NASA was doing it.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Oh, absolutely,
because there's no bureaucracy.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the recent
decisions that they made,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:84%
which was just brilliant,
they did all this testing

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.390 align:middle line:84%
on different kinds of carbon
fiber and special polymers

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.742 align:middle line:90%
to build a hull.

00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And they found that,
yes, it was lighter.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:90%
But it was more expensive.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:90%
It was a long time building.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So they went back to stainless
steel, a stainless steel star

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:90%
hopper.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:84%
You could never do
that in the government.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:90%
That would just never happen.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:84%
The one thing about the
government you can rely on

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
is it is a five-year-long
supertanker.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And once it begins
moving through the water,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.302 align:middle line:90%
it can't turn.

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you're
stuck with it.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: That's it.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But we're doing it now.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Privatization I assume
you think is fantastic.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm meeting with six
asteroid mining companies,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:90%
beginning next month.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be looking at their
technology, their capabilities,

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:90%
their goals.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
duplicating, not many.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:90%
There have already been mergers.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of these got started
up with blockchain.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And they've now come
out of the blockchain

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.820 align:middle line:90%
and gone into real dollars.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're building
serious hardware--

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Bigelow, Google, companies
that we recognize,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:90%
but also some we don't.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.325 align:middle line:84%
And they're building
life support systems.

00:04:39.325 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
They're building
docking systems.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:90%
They're building mainframes.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest innovations
are in propulsion.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
dramatic, isn't it?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It is.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.402 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And reentry rockets.

00:04:51.402 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well,
we're not thinking--

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:90%
yeah, returnable rockets.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's brilliant.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.150 align:middle line:10%
Anybody's that's
watched the videos--

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.608 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That saves
a lot of money.

00:04:59.608 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It does.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
You could turn them around
in a couple of weeks

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:90%
and right back up again.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your quest to
want us to, one, go back

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
to the Moon would be
what, for mining purposes?

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yes, and for new
energy, because the Moon has

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:90%
in great supply several things.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it has a
lot of volatile compounds

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.305 align:middle line:84%
that are difficult
to produce here.

00:05:20.305 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to produce
them with oil.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.028 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We have to refine
them and crack them,

00:05:24.028 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and it's polluting.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.420 align:middle line:84%
But they exist in the lower
areas of craters on the Moon

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:90%
because it's dark and it's cold.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And they exist in liquid
form or even solid form.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And those volatile compounds
can be recovered and used

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:90%
for further space exploration.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And helium-3--

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
helium-3, Brooks?

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Helium-3 is
a compound of helium

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:90%
that's light a neutron.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And it exists on Earth,
but in small amounts.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Most of the helium
we have here is helium-4.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:84%
To get helium-3, you've got
to get it from volcanoes,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
because it exists mostly
in the inside of the Earth.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But on the Moon, it's
plentiful everywhere.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And what it could
basically be used for

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:84%
is to replace fissile materials,
like uranium and cesium,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
in our nuclear power plants
to generate electricity,

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:90%
except no more radiation.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Absolutely.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't have to worry
about a Fukushima disaster.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Correct.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you bring a shipping
container of helium-3 back

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and convert the nuclear
power plant, instead of

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.790 align:middle line:84%
a three-year fuel supply, you
have a 30-year fuel supply.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will it be NASA that
gets us back to the Moon?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Absolutely not.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't think so?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: No.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any one
government can handle it now,

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:84%
because we realize when
we did go to the Moon,

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:90%
we were really lucky.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
The magnetosphere
behaved itself.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:84%
The solar flares
behaved themselves.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:90%
We didn't lose anybody.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
All the astronauts lived
to be ripe old ages.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.393 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a little
bit different.

00:06:58.393 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:90%
Our atmosphere is different.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:90%
The magnetosphere is different.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to lose anybody,
because it's valuable.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:84%
What we want to do is
bring the money home.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Back in 2019,
Brooks, the "PBS NewsHour"

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:10%
ran a piece on NASA
attempting to want to get back

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:10%
to the Moon in 2024.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:10%
>> One year into his tenure
as NASA administrator,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:10%
Jim Bridenstine is a man on
a new mission for the space

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:10%
agency.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Please join me in
welcoming Jim Bridenstine.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:10%
>> It made him a star at
the 35th Space Symposium

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:10%
in Colorado Springs, the
annual convening of the cosmic

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:10%
cognoscenti.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:10%
>> So many in this room are
familiar that we've been given

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:10%
now a new charge, that we
are going to place humans

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:10%
on the surface of the
Moon in five years.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:10%
For a number of
years at NASA, they

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.857 align:middle line:10%
weren't really allowed to
talk about going to the Moon.

00:07:56.857 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:10%
And now, they not only can
talk about going to the Moon.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:10%
The idea that we're going
to be there in five years

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.290 align:middle line:10%
has everybody extremely excited.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:10%
>> US astronauts on
the moon by 2024--

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:10%
Vice President Mike Pence
dropped that gauntlet

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.630 align:middle line:10%
at the end of March.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, make no
mistake about it.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:10%
We're in a space race today,
just as we were in the 1960s.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:10%
And the stakes are even higher.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.410 align:middle line:10%
>> A space race with whom?

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:10%
A private mission designed
by Elon Musk and SpaceX

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:10%
or also China, which landed
on the far side of the Moon

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:10%
in January and vows to build
a permanent encampment there

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:10%
in a decade?

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.603 align:middle line:10%
It's a time frame that invokes
another race, another era.

00:08:42.603 --> 00:08:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's funny, Brooks.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
They act like we never
went to the Moon.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
it's all over.

00:08:48.585 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
It's starting all
over again, isn't it?

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
kind of benefited

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
from the first whole Moon
venture because when it ended,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.870 align:middle line:84%
NASA dissolved
the greatest brain

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.162 align:middle line:90%
trust the world had ever built.

00:09:01.162 --> 00:09:02.662 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some of
them went to SpaceX

00:09:02.662 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:90%
and all these other companies.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.878 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And some of them
came to universities.

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I took industrial technology
from a former NASA engineer.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: So all the universities
benefited from that, as well.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:90%
But the overall world suffered.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:84%
The space race they talk about
today really has three lanes.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:84%
It has an economic lane, which
SpaceX and other companies--

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
they smell, right?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, sure.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:84%
A single asteroid,
a single haul,

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:84%
could be worth $300
to $400 billion.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:90%
This is a great payday.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.200 align:middle line:90%
The second is governmental.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the high
ground is what you

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:90%
want in any military situation.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And I've said for a long,
long time, maybe four

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:84%
decades, he who drills the
Moon will control the Earth.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But the third one
is kind of it taps

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:84%
into the nature of
humanity itself.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Are we explorers,
or are we warriors?

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
we're explorers.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Every time Earth has had a
frontier, man has done well.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Man has explored into
those frontiers, developed

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.570 align:middle line:90%
those frontiers.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Those colonies broke off
from the main government that

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:84%
was running the
world at the time,

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:90%
and the entire world benefited.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.050 align:middle line:84%
We are out of frontiers
on this world.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.837 align:middle line:84%
The only frontier left
is the bottom of the sea.

00:10:26.837 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're not fighting
wars over that.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
We're not moving people to
the bottom of the ocean.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
That frontier is two
days away, two days away.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are billions of
dollars hanging in the balance.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any one
government can make it,

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:90%
but they're going to try.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Not only China,
not only Russia--

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
we recently had an
unsuccessful launch from India.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:90%
Everything went well.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.897 align:middle line:90%
They did things step by step.

00:10:50.897 --> 00:10:52.480 align:middle line:84%
They went into orbit
around the Earth.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
They went from
Earth to the Moon,

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.583 align:middle line:84%
went to orbit around
the Moon, and then they

00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:90%
splatted on the surface.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:90%
Trial and error.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.883 align:middle line:90%
They'll get it, eventually.

00:10:59.883 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, we
want less error.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.432 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We want more
return on investment.

00:11:03.432 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should we be working as
a joint effort with the planet,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to these individual
companies or countries?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, this is
the dynamic of humanity.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it
from that standpoint,

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:84%
we are on the threshold
of an era of perhaps 1,000

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.650 align:middle line:84%
years of peace, if we
come together as Earth

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and quit marching at one
another with our tribal flags

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.640 align:middle line:84%
about what resources
we have here.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's turn our sights to the
stars or at least to the Moon,

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:84%
to Mars, and maybe
the asteroid belt.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's enough
frontier for 1,000 years.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there enough
money on this planet

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.510 align:middle line:90%
to do these things?

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yes, there is, because
of the return on investment.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.030 align:middle line:84%
A single asteroid,
which we have identified

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.685 align:middle line:84%
and we already have nomenclature
for, is almost solid platinum.

00:12:02.685 --> 00:12:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what do we
do with it, this asteroid?

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Do we land on it?

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:90%
What happens to it?

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: There are three
methods of mining asteroids.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:84%
One is called a
"surface gathering."

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
asteroids have clumps

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:90%
of debris on the surface.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.430 align:middle line:84%
We've developed a spacecraft
which is called the Dragonfly.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It lands
on the surface,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and it basically scoops up the
loose debris and then leaves.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much
debris does it take?

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:90%
Tons?

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes, tons.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But in space, tons
doesn't mean anything.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: If you're going
to bring it back to Earth,

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:90%
then you have reentry issues.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going
to take it to the Moon

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.873 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to put it
in orbit around the Moon

00:12:38.873 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to take
it to Mars, a totally

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
different repayment dynamic,
because now what you've created

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
are way stations for raw
materials-- for fuel,

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
for water, for oxygen,
for propellant.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are now on the way

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:84%
being built, just like
any frontier is explored.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they call the space

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:90%
between Earth and the Moon?

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And why is that so important?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.237 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, we use
the word "cislunar."

00:13:04.237 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Cislunar."

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: "Cislunar" because
it is two days away,

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:84%
but there are some
hazards along the way.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:90%
There's the magnetosphere.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.990 align:middle line:90%
There's solar radiation.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:84%
We're thinking, as you
saw in that PBS special,

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:90%
about landing on the surface.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:90%
That's generally a bad idea.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: On a good day, things
are hazardous on the Moon.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On a good day.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.847 align:middle line:84%
When the Sun's having a bad
day, the surface of the Moon

00:13:27.847 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:90%
is a very bad place to be.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
want to be there.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: No.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But we have identified what
are called "volcanic vents."

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:10%
These volcanic vents
are long since inactive,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:10%
but they're handy because they
have about a 100-meter opening.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:10%
And they go into the
planet about 15 kilometers.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:84%
We can send 3D printers
up there, take lunar soil,

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:84%
seal up the opening with
about a 100-mile-thick wall,

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and then go through the wall
and develop the environment

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of the Moon.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're shielded
from solar radiation.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.123 align:middle line:84%
You can stabilize
the atmosphere.

00:14:04.123 --> 00:14:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can live there.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Absolutely.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.947 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Should we live there?

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes, I think we should.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:90%
We could take it.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We could have
been there by now, right?

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.868 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, we could have.

00:14:12.868 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over all these years?

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be boring,
Brooks, for somebody?

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.203 align:middle line:84%
How long would you want to
stay on the Moon, personally?

00:14:21.203 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: I don't know.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.670 align:middle line:90%
I could do it for a lifetime.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could you really?

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Sure, because
there's so much to do.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd go nuts.

00:14:26.515 --> 00:14:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: There's a
lot to do here, too.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.242 align:middle line:84%
But there, everything you
do is new, everything.

00:14:31.242 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I
couldn't even go up

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
in the International
Space Station

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.653 align:middle line:90%
for more than a couple days.

00:14:35.653 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yeah, that's
pretty weightless.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't like being weightless.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:90%
It's nauseating.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.840 align:middle line:84%
But 1/6 gravity,
I can handle that.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Look at the volcanic vents we've
explored here on the Earth.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:90%
They're amazing.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:90%
They're huge.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:84%
They're bigger than this
room and long as a mile.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And they could
easily be terraformed

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:90%
on the inside as a habitat.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
exploring that just gets you?

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Wow, that's a
really great question.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Never had that question before.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like almost
something genetic in me.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're like the
modern-day Marco Polo.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Sort of.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Capitalism is that way.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Capitalism is
a system of service,

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
where one person will see
a need another person has,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a house or
a road or health care.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And this person develops that
service to meet that need

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.450 align:middle line:90%
and gets paid for it.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:90%
That's capitalism.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And the people that do
it best get paid well.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's always competition,
and everything grows.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:90%
This system is save the world.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.450 align:middle line:84%
What happens,
though, like NASA, is

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:84%
you have companies
that will end up

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.240 align:middle line:84%
using government agencies
to prevent other companies

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:90%
from competing with them.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And that turns
into more fascism.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.707 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That's more
dangerous kind of capitalism.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what we're
facing around the world.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:84%
We're also seeing the world kind
of revolt against that right

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.427 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's going on,
Brooks, with the Russians?

00:16:05.427 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Other than having the
ability to launch us--

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:84%
they're taking us to
the ISS, for example--

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:90%
they're not doing anything.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.020 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Without being
insulting, Russia's too small.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Their economy's too small.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can't afford it?

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: They can't afford it.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:90%
They're very smart.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows in Europe,
the very best technologies

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:90%
in Europe come from Russia.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I'm going there in
June to spend three weeks.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a dry run for
the Hollow Earth Expedition.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But I could tell you
right now, they're

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:90%
amazingly productive people.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And they just realize it's too
big of a challenge for them.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Alone.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
They have to partner with
someone in order to do it.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will they
partner with the Chinese?

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Chinese are
a different story.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese have an issue.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
You have China, and
you have the Chinese.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
China thinks it's
doing just fine.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese do not.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Sooner or later,
that's going to resolve itself.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:84%
But we're seeing a little bit
of that in the political world.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
take a look at NASA

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and their plans for
their Moon mission.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:84%
>> 50 years ago, we
pioneered a path to the Moon.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
The trail we blazed cut
through the fictions of science

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.035 align:middle line:84%
and showed us all
what was possible.

00:17:25.035 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very pretty out here.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, our calling to
explore is even greater.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:84%
To go farther, we must be able
to sustain missions of greater

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:90%
distance and duration.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
We must use the resources
we find at our destinations.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:84%
We must overcome radiation,
isolation, gravity, and extreme

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.300 align:middle line:90%
environments like never before.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:84%
These are the challenges we face
to push the bounds of humanity.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to the Moon to
stay by 2024, and this is how.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>> This all starts with
the ability to get larger,

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
heavier payloads off-planet
and beyond Earth's gravity.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>> For this, we design
an entirely new rocket.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The Space Launch System,
SLS, will be the most powerful

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:90%
rocket ever developed.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And with components
in production--

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>> And more in testing--

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The system is capable
of being the catalyst

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:90%
for deep-space missions.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We need a capsule that can
support humans from launch--

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Through deep space and
return safely back to Earth.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>> For this, we've built Orion.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> This is NASA's
next-generation human space

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:90%
capsule.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Using data from lunar
orbiters that continue

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.970 align:middle line:84%
to reveal the Moon's
hazards and resources--

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> We're currently developing
an entirely new approach

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
to landing and
operating on the Moon.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Using our commercial partners
to deliver science instruments

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and robotics to the surface,
we're paving the way for human

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:90%
missions in 2024.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Our charge is to
go quickly and stay,

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.000 align:middle line:84%
to press our collective efforts
forward with a fervor that will

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
see us return to the Moon in a
manner that is wholly different

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.928 align:middle line:90%
than 50 years ago.

00:19:09.928 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, looking
at that clip, Brooks,

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:84%
you would assume NASA's going
to get us back there again.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That's a great
sales job, isn't it?

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Great logo, great
music, great production,

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:90%
but it's largely empty--

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
going to happen--

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.792 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Because NASA doesn't
have the budget to do it.

00:19:23.792 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
NASA doesn't actually do
anything that makes money.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.650 align:middle line:90%
They're an administration.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They spend money.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well,
they shuffle money.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:90%
JPL makes stuff.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.420 align:middle line:10%
>>AGNEW: They actually
build the stuff.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.260 align:middle line:10%
My friends at Hughes Satellite,
they actually make stuff.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:10%
What we've been doing now
is launching cubesats.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:10%
These are little
satellites about the size

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.210 align:middle line:10%
of a lunchbox or
a beer cooler that

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:10%
have capabilities of cell phone
technology or GPS technology

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:10%
or weather management or
other kinds of surveillance.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:90%
That makes money.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.290 align:middle line:90%
NASA doesn't make money.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.690 align:middle line:84%
NASA's been largely
the impediment

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:84%
of the private industry
actually getting going.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
They make great
promotional films,

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.060 align:middle line:84%
but NASA's not the ones that
are going to get us to the Moon.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:84%
As I said, be on the
surface of the Moon,

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:90%
not a really great idea.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
It's only a matter
of time before that

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:90%
has a disastrous outcome.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And I also said that
we're going to make innovations

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:90%
in propulsion.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
It takes more energy to get from
the surface of the Earth out

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:84%
of orbit than the entire
rest of the mission combined.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.348 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in orbit,
it's easy, right?

00:20:37.348 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Or out of orbit.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Once you're floating
in space, then it's

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:90%
pretty easy to move around.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that these private
companies are coming up with--

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:84%
let's move the
capability to space,

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:90%
and then let's build in space.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's build things in
the vacuum of space

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:90%
or on the surface of the Moon--

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:84%
much, much lower operating
cost from there on.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
The issue is that
you begin to cross

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:09.690 align:middle line:84%
into the line of vulnerability
for Earth itself.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
was so important

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:84%
about this new defense
department that has been

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.867 align:middle line:90%
developed by President Trump.

00:21:18.867 --> 00:21:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I'll just put this hat
on just for a second.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Space Force.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The Space
Force makes it possible

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:84%
because if these private
industries invest

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
all this money to go to
the Moon and mine helium-3

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and to generate oxygen and water
and all kinds of raw materials

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.290 align:middle line:84%
to build bigger space
machines, they've

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:84%
got to have somebody
to protect them.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.717 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just in case.

00:21:42.717 --> 00:21:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And that's
what Space Force is for.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.935 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Protect them from whom?

00:21:45.935 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, there
are three threats.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:84%
One, of course, is from other
nations here on the Earth.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: ICBMs
going up into orbit

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and smashing into
some country, we

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:90%
could stop that pretty easily.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
If we had an extraterrestrial
threat-- and I

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
don't mean aliens coming
in with an armada.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But that could be, too.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:84%
More likely is a
comet or an asteroid

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.340 align:middle line:84%
or a meteor that comes out of
the Oort belt or the Kuiper

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:90%
belt and is headed for Earth.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:84%
It would take us months to
mobilize something from Earth

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:90%
to be able to take that out.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:84%
If we were already
on the Moon, we

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
could see it almost as soon
as it begins moving out there.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And we would have
the resources--

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.617 align:middle line:84%
low-energy requirements-- to
go attach ourselves to it.

00:22:30.617 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple ways
to move it out of the way.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.570 align:middle line:84%
One is to park the
spacecraft a little ways away

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and just use the gravitational
pull to pull it away.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The other is to
stick a couple rockets on it,

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
light it up, and push
it out of its path.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And the other's
to blow to pieces.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
The latter is not
very desirable,

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.518 align:middle line:84%
because then you create
an unpredictable cloud

00:22:50.518 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
of high-velocity particles
you have to deal with.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.202 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It's best just
to push it out of the way

00:22:55.202 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:90%
or push it into the Sun.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it's happening.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It's happening.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Budgets have been
approved and everything else.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Budgets
have been approved,

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:90%
and it's a small organization.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not a bureaucracy yet.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not a NASA.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have layers
and layers and layers

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
of people that are trying to
make a career for themselves.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:84%
This is specifically
built to protect America

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:84%
from threats that come to
or go into and out of space.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which I agree,
we need to do that.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once we get back to
the Moon, are we going to Mars?

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Yes, that's
the next plan.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that a
lot of science fiction writers

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:90%
have picked up on this.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And they always pave the
way, always pave the way,

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:90%
for these kinds of things.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Once we're to the Moon, the next
logical step is to go to Mars.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Right outside of Mars,
between Mars and Jupiter,

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:46.990 align:middle line:90%
is the asteroid belt.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.832 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I don't think
we'll make it much further

00:23:49.832 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:84%
than that the next
few hundred years.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:90%
We won't need to.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But all the raw materials
that we need to do this

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:90%
are up there.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't Mars a
two-year trip right now?

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Well, if it's at its
closest point, it's about four,

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:84%
four-and-a-half months with
our current propulsion systems.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:84%
In the furthest point of the
orbit, it's about seven months.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a long time to be
weightless in space for a human

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Plus you have to supply
them with food and water.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:84%
You can't resupply
them, can you?

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: No, there's
no supply chain.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have to
improve on our propulsion

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the new
ion thrusters are coming in.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.490 align:middle line:84%
They either use a
fuel, like water.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Or they use the Casimir
effect, where they gather ions

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:84%
from another dimension, charge
them, and accelerate them

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:90%
out a nozzle.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:84%
You can create thrust
that will push a craft,

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:84%
accelerate slowly,
maybe at 0.1 or 0.2 G's.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.535 align:middle line:84%
But you can accelerate
for a couple weeks

00:24:52.535 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
need to refuel.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:84%
You're just using
sunlight for energy.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you can reach
speeds of about 0.3, even 0.4

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.480 align:middle line:90%
light speed.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can cut the trip
to Mars down to a week.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god, that's amazing.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Why Mars, Brooks?

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We're
fascinated with Mars.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Mars has an atmosphere
about 1/100 the density

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.870 align:middle line:90%
of our atmosphere here.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:84%
We think that Mars at one
time had an atmosphere.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Something catastrophic happened.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:90%
It stripped it away.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the next logical
place for us to go.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We've actually sent
more missions to Venus

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:30.523 align:middle line:90%
than we have Mars.

00:25:30.523 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: But we believe
that we could eventually

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.800 align:middle line:84%
create a habitat on Mars
that would support life.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mars captures
our imagination.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, there's a
love affair we have with Mars.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's because of "War
of the Worlds" or something.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.430 align:middle line:84%
But we love to talk about
the possibilities on Mars,

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:90%
don't we?

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.075 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes, we do.

00:25:53.075 --> 00:25:53.875 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:53.875 --> 00:25:57.138 align:middle line:84%
And Mars is a desert
planet, as far as we know.

00:25:57.138 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:84%
All the probes that
we've sent there,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:84%
we know the minerals
that are there.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
But we also know that there's
no current life form that exists

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:90%
in large quantity on Mars.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.948 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should we build a
base on Mars and live there?

00:26:09.948 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Eventually, yes.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll take a couple
hundred years before that

>>NOORY: That long?

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.120 align:middle line:90%
100 years?

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I think so, because
at the end of the day

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
or at least now,
all those resources

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:90%
have to come from here.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.953 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And our bowl only
has so much money in it.

00:26:28.953 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:84%
If we start carving
off that money

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and shipping it
to another world,

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be
politically very popular.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
There's no return on
investment from Mars to here.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
There is a return on investment
from the Moon to here.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.290 align:middle line:84%
There is a return on investment
from the asteroid belt to here.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to have
to expand the economy.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have to
do something as a planet,

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:90%
instead of as nations.

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talked
about 3D printers.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.457 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
in relationship to Mars.

00:27:00.457 --> 00:27:03.439 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:03.439 --> 00:28:13.540 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.672 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it exciting?

00:28:14.672 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Regardless of
what direction we go in.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We change the
way we build things here

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.790 align:middle line:84%
on this planet by
using concrete pumpers.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We take
a concrete truck,

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:84%
dump the liquid
concrete into a hopper,

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:90%
and it goes up a long pipe.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's pumped into
and fills up the forms.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.030 align:middle line:84%
This is basically
what a 3D printer is.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.538 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: You're going
to take lunar soil,

00:28:36.538 --> 00:28:39.222 align:middle line:84%
mix it with compounds, maybe add
some energy, some heat to it,

00:28:39.222 --> 00:28:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going to go
back and forth, back and forth.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to layer
out these structures.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
technology's amazing.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: The contest
that you showed here

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that was done at a university
was highly innovative,

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.910 align:middle line:90%
and it proved a lot of things.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.590 align:middle line:84%
But again, you're talking
about surface structures.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:90%
On the Moon, this is a bad idea.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But it can be used
to develop things

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:90%
inside those volcanic vents.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And once you start
up a 3D printer,

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.430 align:middle line:84%
it prints 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.590 align:middle line:84%
In a very short amount
of time, a month or two

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:84%
with no malfunctions, you could
create one heck of a structure.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's clean
and simple, isn't it?

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: It is simple.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've talked
about the asteroids.

00:29:20.112 --> 00:29:21.100 align:middle line:90%
What's beyond Mars?

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.970 align:middle line:84%
The asteroid belt
between Mars and Jupiter?

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yeah.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
something there to mine?

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Lots.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:31.552 align:middle line:84%
There are asteroids of platinum,
of rhodium, of ice itself.

00:29:31.552 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And of course, once
you have water,

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.605 align:middle line:84%
then you could split it
into hydrogen and oxygen.

00:29:36.605 --> 00:29:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, you have rocket fuel.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.490 align:middle line:90%
You've got--

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God, great potential.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Correct.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
You've got the ability
to create environments

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.230 align:middle line:84%
without having to have
an umbilical cord back

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.430 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We've got a
little clip on asteroids

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:10%
and their benefits.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Asteroids, also
known as "minor planets"

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:10%
or "planetoids," are chunks of
space debris in orbit around

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:10%
the Sun.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:10%
They are the material
left over from when

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:10%
the planets were formed
and range from a few meters

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:10.800 align:middle line:10%
to hundreds of
kilometers in diameter.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.740 align:middle line:10%
Most asteroids are located
in the main asteroid belt

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.900 align:middle line:10%
between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.010 align:middle line:10%
This contains millions of
asteroids, of which 750,000

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:10%
are more than one kilometer
across, with over 200 exceeding

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:10%
100 kilometers in diameter.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:10%
Asteroids in the
main belt are so

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.600 align:middle line:10%
spread out that most are
hundreds of thousands

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.310 align:middle line:10%
of kilometers apart.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:10%
Located outside the main
belt are three groups

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.310 align:middle line:10%
of near-Earth asteroids called
the "Atens," the "Amors,"

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.870 align:middle line:10%
and the "Apollos."

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:46.190 align:middle line:10%
These groups contain about 9,000
asteroids, with nearly 1,000

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.860 align:middle line:10%
more than one kilometer in size.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.110 align:middle line:10%
Due to their relative
proximity to our planet,

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:54.560 align:middle line:10%
some 1,500 near-Earth
asteroids are prime candidates

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.420 align:middle line:10%
for mining operations.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.240 align:middle line:10%
Asteroids are made of
a variety of materials,

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:10%
with the majority classified
as "C-Type," "S-Type,"

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.480 align:middle line:10%
or "M-Type."

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.530 align:middle line:84%
"C-Type" or "carbonaceous"
asteroids are the most common

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and are thought to consist
of carbon compounds, rock,

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:16.350 align:middle line:84%
up to 20% water,
and some metals.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:19.470 align:middle line:84%
"S-Type" or "silicaceous"
asteroids are then mostly made

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:84%
of iron and magnesium silicates,
with smaller quantities

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:26.520 align:middle line:84%
of nickel and iron, as well
as some platinum-group metals.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Finally, "M-Type" or "metallic"
asteroids are mainly composed

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:84%
of pure nickel and iron,
with smaller platinum-group

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.380 align:middle line:90%
deposits.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:38.010 align:middle line:10%
A single platinum-rich
500-meter-wide asteroid

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:10%
has been estimated to contain
1.5 times the known world

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:10%
reserves of
platinum-group metals.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.980 align:middle line:10%
Out in space, the water to
be found on C-Type asteroids

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.460 align:middle line:10%
will be just as valuable
as metal deposits,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:10%
as water is a critical
commodity, both for sustaining

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.760 align:middle line:10%
humans in space and as a source
of oxygen for rocket fuel.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.580 align:middle line:10%
Even basic asteroid rock may
prove a valuable building

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.960 align:middle line:10%
material, as it could shield
humans from deadly radiation.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.670 align:middle line:10%
As all of these
examples illustrate,

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.320 align:middle line:10%
there are significant
possibilities

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.930 align:middle line:10%
to exploit asteroids
as a valuable source

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.150 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial resources.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.070 align:middle line:10%
It has indeed already
been calculated

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:19.040 align:middle line:10%
that some individual asteroids
contain raw materials

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.535 align:middle line:10%
worth more than $100 billion.

00:32:22.535 --> 00:32:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brooks, do you
think the asteroid belt was

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.350 align:middle line:84%
a planet that blew up
or what could have been

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:90%
a planet that never formed?

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I don't
think it's the latter.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I think probably, you're
looking at a planet

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:90%
that was there in orbit.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It had a catastrophic
collision with something--

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened--

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.553 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Broke into
a bunch of chunks,

00:32:40.553 --> 00:32:42.180 align:middle line:90%
and stayed in the same orbit.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when we talk
about asteroids approaching

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:48.420 align:middle line:84%
the planet or zooming by
Earth, did they all originate

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.663 align:middle line:90%
from the asteroid belt?

00:32:49.663 --> 00:32:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Or are they coming in from
outside the solar system?

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: No, they come in from
the Kuiper Belt or the Oort

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Cloud.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Asteroids do not usually
get out of their behavior

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and come zooming through
the solar system.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Meteors do, and comets do.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But asteroids are pretty
good-size gravitational bodies

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:90%
in and of themselves.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they pretty much
stay in that cloud.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Outside of that, there
are millions of bodies

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.780 align:middle line:84%
out there, ranging in
size from a lunchbox

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:33.130 align:middle line:84%
to a city block, that can get
bumped or create a collision

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:84%
or somehow fall out of orbit
and come crossing other orbits.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were given
one project to accomplish--

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.690 align:middle line:84%
the budget, everything--
what would that project be?

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Wow.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would like
to create probably

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:84%
a habitat on the Moon
to be able to facilitate

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.440 align:middle line:90%
heavy lifting from there.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.865 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: Launching
things from the Moon

00:33:54.865 --> 00:33:58.550 align:middle line:84%
or from the orbit of the Moon is
way easier than launching them

00:33:58.550 --> 00:33:59.870 align:middle line:90%
from the Earth.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.007 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In terms of
gravitational pull

00:34:02.007 --> 00:34:02.840 align:middle line:90%
and everything else?

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Right.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Overcoming the gravitational
pull of the Moon,

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:10.010 align:middle line:84%
having the raw materials,
not putting human life

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:13.070 align:middle line:84%
on the surface at risk every
single time you launch,

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.870 align:middle line:90%
every single time you come back.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brooks, is
space the final frontier?

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:18.469 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Maybe.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.239 align:middle line:84%
Other dimensions
maybe beyond that,

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.370 align:middle line:90%
but we're meant to be free.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:23.870 align:middle line:90%
We're meant to be explorers.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:27.889 align:middle line:84%
We're meant to dream
large and to do

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:30.480 align:middle line:84%
everything we can do to try
to accomplish those dreams.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will 2024
show us a Mars mission?

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Maybe on the paper.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
going to happen by 2024.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't?

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.707 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: No, I think
the risk is too high.

00:34:43.707 --> 00:34:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But can we?

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Can we do it?

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:48.110 align:middle line:90%
We went there 50 years ago.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: We have put rovers
on there, and most of them

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:84%
have been successful beyond
our wildest imagination.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I was talking with Dr. Jim
Bell, who ran the Opportunity

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.680 align:middle line:90%
and Spirit rovers on Mars.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And he really didn't
know what to do once they

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.000 align:middle line:90%
exceeded their mission life.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.220 align:middle line:84%
They were then given
back to Caltech.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Caltech grad students developed
research projects with them

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.880 align:middle line:84%
until their life
expectancy was over.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.277 align:middle line:84%
But it was a magnificently
successful project.

00:35:20.277 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Beyond anything
they could imagine.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Absolutely.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.855 align:middle line:84%
We have the capability
and the mental know-how

00:35:26.855 --> 00:35:28.730 align:middle line:84%
to do these things you've
been talking about.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:29.642 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Yes, we do.

00:35:29.642 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what's so exciting.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.517 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I'm excited
about meeting

00:35:32.517 --> 00:35:37.790 align:middle line:84%
with these private companies
that are really building things

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:40.860 align:middle line:90%
like docking systems, habitats.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.367 align:middle line:84%
Bigelow has done
amazing things--

00:35:42.367 --> 00:35:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
floating hotels, right?

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Inflatable spacecraft.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:46.947 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:46.947 --> 00:35:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: And the
innovations that he's

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.950 align:middle line:84%
made in multilayering
Kevlar and other materials

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:57.448 align:middle line:84%
has created an almost
micro meteor-immune habitat

00:35:57.448 --> 00:35:58.490 align:middle line:90%
that we can put in space.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.698 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From getting pelted.

00:35:59.698 --> 00:36:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Sure.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he making
money on space yet?

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: I think so.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.152 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they're all making money.

00:36:05.152 --> 00:36:06.740 align:middle line:90%
There's profit to be made.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's been
going up on the private side

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.890 align:middle line:90%
has been making money.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.368 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing it
for less cost than what

00:36:13.368 --> 00:36:14.660 align:middle line:90%
the government did in the past.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are any private Chinese
companies doing things, Brooks?

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Or is it all government?

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.465 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: I don't think
there's any such thing

00:36:20.465 --> 00:36:22.027 align:middle line:90%
as a private Chinese company.

00:36:22.027 --> 00:36:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I've been working with
them for a long, long time.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And many of the private
companies in China

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.790 align:middle line:84%
all answer to the
Chinese government.

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What comes first with
our next move, the Space Force?

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: That is a very good
step in the right direction,

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.700 align:middle line:84%
because what it shows
is official endorsement

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.075 align:middle line:90%
that space actually exists.

00:36:43.075 --> 00:36:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
going to still have

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.300 align:middle line:90%
to overcome the public stigma.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.350 align:middle line:84%
What in the world
are we going to space

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:51.920 align:middle line:84%
if we have homeless
living on the streets?

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which has
always been an argument.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AGNEW: It's always
been an argument.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.480 align:middle line:10%
The benefits far
outweigh the risks.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.850 align:middle line:10%
And in any business venture,
that's what you're looking for.

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:04.770 align:middle line:10%
Yes, it might cost $100
million to pull it off.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.357 align:middle line:84%
But if you can make
$200 million doing it,

00:37:07.357 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll do that three times a week.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's worth
it for somebody.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: Absolutely.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
next big dramatic thing

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:16.910 align:middle line:84%
that we will find out
about, in your opinion?

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: In space exploration?

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, the testing
of the ion thrusters

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I think has been
the most innovative.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Recently, there
was a contest where

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.530 align:middle line:90%
ion thrusters were tested.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:84%
One of the thrusters was
not tested because they

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:90%
didn't think it would work.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:38.067 align:middle line:84%
They finally were shamed into
hooking it up, and it worked.

00:37:38.067 --> 00:37:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And the remarkable thing
about this thruster

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.610 align:middle line:90%
is it requires no fuel.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No fuel?

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: No fuel.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.320 align:middle line:84%
The particles pop
into this dimension

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:90%
from another dimension.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.330 align:middle line:10%
They're then charged
and pushed out the back,

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:55.180 align:middle line:10%
which creates the thrust.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.610 align:middle line:10%
Nobody thought
this was possible.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:00.250 align:middle line:90%
But this is so innovative.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.622 align:middle line:84%
It's going to change the
way we travel in space.

00:38:02.622 --> 00:38:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brooks, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:05.705 align:middle line:90%
>>AGNEW: My pleasure.

00:38:05.705 --> 00:38:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How dramatic.

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:10.330 align:middle line:84%
All these events that will
occur in our lifetime,

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:12.520 align:middle line:84%
we'll begin to be able
to see them unfold.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.060 align:middle line:10%
And one day, we'll be
able to see man back

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:20.990 align:middle line:10%
on the Moon, men
on Mars or women,

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:22.680 align:middle line:10%
and it could save humanity.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
