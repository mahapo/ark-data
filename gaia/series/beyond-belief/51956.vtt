00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:07.372 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.372 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.646 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.183 align:middle line:10%
You know, since the
beginning of time,

00:00:30.183 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:10%
mankind has been fascinated
with the heavens, things

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:10%
that have been
going on in space.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:10%
But who is out there to record
these incredible stories?

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:10%
Bob Zimmerman is our special
guest on Beyond Belief today.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:10%
Noted author, several
of his works "Genesis:

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:10%
The story of Apollo 8,"
and also "Leaving Earth,"

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:10%
and so much more.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.114 align:middle line:10%
His special website, of
course, behindtheblack.com,

00:00:57.114 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:10%
is one of those websites
I go to all the time

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:10%
when I want current
space information

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:10%
and historical space news.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Beyond
Belief," Bob Zimmerman.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.105 align:middle line:90%
Bob, always a pleasure.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BOB ZIMMERMAN:
It's a pleasure.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:90%
It's really great.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.759 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
so interested in space?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Because I was as a kid.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: I was as a kid, I
was growing up during the '60s.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:10%
The space program was happening.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:10%
You know, in the
second grade they

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:10%
would wheel those giant
TVs into our classroom

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:10%
when John Glenn was
going to take off

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.994 align:middle line:10%
and we'd watch it happen.

00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
you get into it.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:90%
This is the future.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.728 align:middle line:84%
That's how I saw
the future coming.

00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted at least be part
of that future in some manner.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.636 align:middle line:84%
And so that's always
been a passion to me,

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
to see what's going on
in space and find out

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:84%
what the future is
going to be like.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where the
future's going to be,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.093 align:middle line:90%
it's in space.

00:01:44.093 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I was
about 13, 14 years old,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:84%
my parents got me my
very first telescope,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:90%
and I was just fascinated by it.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was a kid
growing up in Detroit.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
They got it for
me for Christmas.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Yeah.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was a
cold December night.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Yeah.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I took it outside
and I'm adjusting it

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.210 align:middle line:84%
so I could have my little
spot star finder there

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was a three inch
telescope, a refractor.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
aiming it at Saturn.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
with the naked eye

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
you see what looks
like a little star,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.270 align:middle line:84%
but with this powerful
little telescope,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.780 align:middle line:90%
you can see the rings of Saturn.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And, Bob, it was
as if somebody had

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:90%
painted a picture out there.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:90%
I was mesmerized by it.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen anything
like that before.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And the wonderment of space
for me just opened up.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.809 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't get enough.

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well,
you just described

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:84%
my-- I had almost an identical
experience, George, in New York

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:90%
City.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And what struck me
when I first got

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
my first glimpse of the moons
of Jupiter and Saturn's rings

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.855 align:middle line:84%
through a telescope--
you know, I

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:49.839 align:middle line:84%
had seen pictures of
those as a kid growing up.

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
We had telescopes
and had been taking

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:90%
pictures of those for centuries.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But to see it in real
life, you suddenly

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.490 align:middle line:84%
realize that there's
magic out there.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Behind the Black, my
website, well that title

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
comes from when the
astronauts were on the moon

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:90%
and the sky is pitch black.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:90%
It's black.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Well what's behind that black?

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And so you look at the star
of Saturn, it's just a dot.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.122 align:middle line:90%
It's a bright star speck.

00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:15.955 align:middle line:84%
You take a telescope
out and you look at it,

00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
you're suddenly seeing
behind the black

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:90%
that there are rings there.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole human endeavor
is looking behind the black,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.350 align:middle line:84%
find out what's
there, what's hidden,

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and from that we learn and
we find out great things.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
It's always more
interesting than we

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
expect it's going to be,
always more fascinating.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.175 align:middle line:84%
And that's space, that's
why I got into it.

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It's very exciting,
very interesting stuff.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you go, you'll
always be surprised.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Do not assume at any point
that a scientific endeavor

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.320 align:middle line:84%
is going to find
a boring result.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
If anything, it's
always going to be

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.824 align:middle line:84%
much more exciting and
perplexing than originally

00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:51.365 align:middle line:84%
thought by the
scientists themselves.

00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
so many things I

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:84%
want to talk with you about
tonight, Bob-- the Apollo

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:84%
missions, and
where we're headed,

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and what's going to happen
with our space program.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But a question like
just looking at Saturn,

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
what keeps that planet from
plunging into the universe?

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:90%
It's just, it's always there.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:90%
It's uniform.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:90%
It rotates.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.450 align:middle line:90%
It stays there.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:90%
It's in our solar system.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we just falling
all over the place?

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.272 align:middle line:84%
Why are we just there
floating around?

00:04:19.272 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well
you know, you got

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:84%
the laws of physics,
Newton's laws.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
mysteries of science.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:84%
We learn things, we
find out how things are.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.517 align:middle line:84%
We find out, for
example, they thought

00:04:30.517 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:84%
the Earth was once in the
center of the universe, center

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, we learn more
that's hidden from us.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
We have to dig a
little bit to discover

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.024 align:middle line:84%
that the sun is in the center
of the universe, not the Earth.

00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:42.315 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing with Saturn.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:84%
You know Saturn's
rings are really

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:84%
interesting from a
scientific perspective

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
because at first scientists
used say, well, that's

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.312 align:middle line:90%
a very temporary phenomenon.

00:04:50.312 --> 00:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
It's very unusual, it's not
really going to be there a lot.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Well what we're learning now is
that the formation of planets

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:84%
mimics what we
see around Saturn.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:84%
The rings of Saturn are
giving us actually a prototype

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:84%
of what a planetary
system will look

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:90%
like in its initial formation.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:10%
So we can learn-- in fact, just
this week they took pictures

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:10%
with Cassini of what
might be a moon.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Forming in the ring.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: In the ring.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:84%
We're actually watching
the possibility

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
of the possible formation of
a moon in the ring of Saturn

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's incredibly cool.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, if you
told me 10 years ago,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.007 align:middle line:84%
oh, we're going to see
the formation of moons,

00:05:26.007 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I'd say that's ridiculous.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.923 align:middle line:84%
It happened millions,
billions of years ago.

00:05:28.923 --> 00:05:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could those
rings be possible moons?

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's possible.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Once again, it's a
learning experience.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
We do not know how a
planetary proplyd ring of dust

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.682 align:middle line:84%
turns into a solar
system like ours.

00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: And there's
a process that goes on.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Saturn might be an
example of a case

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
where it just never
gets to that stage

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:84%
of a solar system,
a mini solar system.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.694 align:middle line:84%
But then maybe it's just taking
its time, it's a slow process.

00:05:55.694 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:90%
This is science.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.276 align:middle line:84%
This is what's interesting
about the universe,

00:05:58.276 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and the mysteries
are worth exploring.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We may
literally be watching

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.686 align:middle line:84%
the birth of another planetary
system right before our eyes.

>>ZIMMERMAN: That's right.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:90%
And isn't that cool?

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It may take
millions of years, right?

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well, you know.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.231 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't it be nice if
they could do it in two weeks?

00:06:13.231 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Now, well, if
it happened in two weeks

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:84%
it could be a little
disastrous in other ways.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, it could be--
things could happen

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:84%
that we don't expect and then
we might be suffering from that.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Your book, "Genesis:
The Story of Apollo 8,"

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:10%
now available as an ebook.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.590 align:middle line:10%
Tell me about this story
and why you wrote it.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.510 align:middle line:10%
>>ZIMMERMAN: I wrote that book
because when I was growing up

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:10%
I thought Apollo 8, that
mission to the moon,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:10%
that was the first time human
beings left Earth orbit, where

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:10%
astronauts actually
were going somewhere.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:10%
It was a very
interesting moment.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:10%
They're in orbit around the
Earth like every other mission

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:10%
before then, and most
missions since then.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:10%
And they suddenly make
a decision, OK, we'll

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:10%
go to the TLI, we're
gonna go to the moon.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:90%
And they fire the rockets.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So, remember this, they're
actually going somewhere.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And they are the
first humans-- that

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.882 align:middle line:84%
was the first time humans
ever went to another planet.

00:07:05.882 --> 00:07:07.465 align:middle line:84%
There will never be
another first time

00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:09.132 align:middle line:84%
that humans go to
another planet.

00:07:09.132 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So I thought from
that perspective,

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:11.798 align:middle line:90%
this is an important mission.

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I remembered when I was
growing up and this happened,

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.490 align:middle line:84%
this mission had significant
cultural influence,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:84%
much more than the
Apollo 11 landing.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.170 align:middle line:84%
The perspective that the
astronauts brought to Earth

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:84%
from the moon while
they were in lunar orbit

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and traveling to
and from the moon

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.600 align:middle line:84%
influenced American
culture significantly.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this
story should be told.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:84%
It had kind of been
forgotten since the '60s.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.396 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, people have
focused on the Apollo 11

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:84%
mission completely and they
don't really talk about this.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So I said a book needs
to be written about this

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.954 align:middle line:84%
because, in many ways, this
was the most important mission.

00:07:49.954 --> 00:07:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke to a
lot of astronauts

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
since from that
time period and they

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:84%
agree this was the most
significant mission, partly

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:90%
because of the risks involved.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:84%
They went thinking
the odds were good,

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
thinking the odds
were 50/50 of success.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.757 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And success
would be what?

00:08:05.757 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Getting back alive.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: They thought the
chances of getting back alive

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.423 align:middle line:90%
were 50/50.

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 50/50.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: And they
thought those were good odds.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just by going
around the moon--

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: That's right.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --they thought
they only had a 50% chance--

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.585 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: One
of the dangers is--

00:08:17.585 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --of coming back.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: --they did not
have the lunar module yet.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So that was a redundancy built
into the whole Apollo system.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, on
Apollo 13 the reason that

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Jim Lovell as commander
survived, the Apollo--

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wasn't Lovell on 8?

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.218 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: He was
on 8, that's correct.

00:08:32.218 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:84%
If what happened to him
on 13 had happened on 8,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
he would've been dead
in about 10 minutes.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No place to go.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: That's right.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.085 align:middle line:84%
And there would've been no
oxygen, no backup system.

00:08:41.085 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So there was a great
risk with this mission

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and we were willing to do
it for a lot of reasons.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:90%
And so this needed to be told.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I wrote "Genesis,"
that's why it was written.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they went
around the moon, Bob,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:84%
was it just one turn and
then back to planet Earth

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:84%
or did they go
around the moon, too?

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: No, they actually--
one of the risks of the mission

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:84%
was they weren't just going
to zip around the moon

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:90%
and come back.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
They were going
to put themselves

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
into orbit around the moon
and stay there for 24 hours,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:05.960 align:middle line:90%
do 20 orbits.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.472 align:middle line:84%
And then they have to
get out of lunar orbit.

00:09:08.472 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And head back.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Head back.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, they only
had one engine that

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:84%
could get them out
of orbit, once again.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.502 align:middle line:90%
This is a single point system.

00:09:15.502 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
If that engine didn't work,
they were stuck in lunar orbit.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.793 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:09:18.793 --> 00:09:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Forever.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.205 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Forever.

00:09:20.205 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And so there's great
gambles involved with this.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.590 align:middle line:90%
And incredible courage involved.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But these people take it
very matter of factly.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:10%
They expected-- they felt the
need to do it for the nation,

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:10%
for the world was so great
that they went and did it.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:10%
And then the irony
that they were

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:10%
in lunar orbit on Christmas eve.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.721 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I remember that
Christmas eve saying.

00:09:41.721 --> 00:09:43.096 align:middle line:84%
You know, there
is a Santa Claus.

00:09:43.096 --> 00:09:44.679 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: They
read from the Bible.

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:45.981 align:middle line:90%
They read from the Bible.

00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:90%
That was what was interesting.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why
you call it "Genesis."

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well, I
called it "Genesis"

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:50.885 align:middle line:84%
because they read
from the Bible.

00:09:50.885 --> 00:09:53.007 align:middle line:84%
It was also genesis of
human exploration of space.

00:09:53.007 --> 00:09:54.340 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting combination.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But they-- one of things
I wanted to find out

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:84%
is how did the
decision come about

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.010 align:middle line:84%
to read from the first 12 verses
of Genesis from the Bible?

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Who made that decision?

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Why did they make it?

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.480 align:middle line:90%
What was the motive behind it?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.270 align:middle line:84%
What were they
trying to accomplish?

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:11.936 align:middle line:90%

>>ZIMMERMAN: That's
exactly right.

00:10:30.536 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:84%
That's also part of the cultural
influence of this mission

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.779 align:middle line:84%
and how it changed America
for the next half century.

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's really
interesting about space.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Space as a activity seems to
predict the future of nations.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Space in the '60s
predicted the future

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:84%
the United States for the next
half century about our culture.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:84%
It also predicted the
future of the Soviet Union.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Their space program was the
first to be capitalistic.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And it laid the groundwork
for their nation

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:84%
to become capitalistic and more
open to the rest of the world.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Well our space
program in the '60s

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
taught us to become
like the Soviet Union--

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
very government
based space program.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
interesting to me now

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:84%
is that the space
program, or space effort,

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.280 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
today is actually

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:84%
predicting America's
future again.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Because our space program
right now is transitioning away

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.134 align:middle line:84%
from government and it's
switching back to a more--

00:11:24.134 --> 00:11:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's going private.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.925 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Private
enterprise system.

00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
ahead of the curve,

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I think, of the rest of
the culture right now.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.240 align:middle line:84%
It's showing us the
way into the future.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.826 align:middle line:90%
This is what space seems to do.

00:11:34.826 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Even though it has nothing to
do with changing cultures--

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.310 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with exploring the
heavens-- it somehow tells us

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:84%
how cultures are
changing down the road.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bob, do you think with
this privatization of space

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that if a company wanted to
land another man on the moon,

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that they could do
it relatively soon?

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Absolutely.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's really interesting.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Private space, let's
talk about just

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.960 align:middle line:90%
what's happened just yesterday.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.116 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:59.116 --> 00:12:01.407 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Over the last
three days, or last weekend.

00:12:01.407 --> 00:12:06.680 align:middle line:84%
SpaceX, company by Elon Musk,
launched the Falcon 9 rocket

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.010 align:middle line:90%
with the Dragon capsule on it.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
This is a privately
built capsule

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:90%
to bring cargo up to ISS.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And United States now has two
privately built companies.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, NASA was trying to
replace the shuttle for 40,

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.447 align:middle line:84%
almost 35, 40 years, and
never really made it.

00:12:22.447 --> 00:12:23.571 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never got it done.

00:12:23.571 --> 00:12:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Never got it done.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Five years ago,
six years ago, NASA

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
decided to give contracts
to two companies

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.640 align:middle line:84%
to replace cargo
capability to ISS.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
In five years, two
private companies

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.340 align:middle line:84%
have now have capsules
to get cargo up to ISS.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:10%
So the Falcon 9
launched, it successfully

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:10%
launched Dragon into
orbit on Sunday.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:10%
Two days later, they put--
Dragon docked with ISS

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:10%
and it brought cargo
to the station.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:84%
What's more significant
about that launch

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:84%
though, is that
Falcon had on it legs.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And what SpaceX is
trying to do is actually

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
make it possible to bring that
first stage back to ground

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:90%
so they could reuse it.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Now this is private enterprise
being innovative, and creative,

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:90%
and competitive.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
If they can get that
first stage reusable,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.134 align:middle line:84%
they reduce the cost of
launch significantly.

00:13:16.134 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatically.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: They can then
undercut everybody else.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And therefore they get
lots more customers.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: And
they make more money.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we have greater
capability to get into space.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Our rockets aren't
discarded anymore.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly it becomes
possible for more customers

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:90%
to enter the business.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:90%
So you get a whole revolution.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a revolution in space
exploration down the road.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And it means that the
possibilities become unlimited

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
because, think,
costs are going down,

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:84%
people are being innovative,
and the possibilities

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:90%
become limitless.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you like
the idea of NASA

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
basically handing it over
to private companies?

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well,
you know, I don't

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.516 align:middle line:84%
think NASA should have the
right to make that decision.

00:13:56.516 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a free country, it
should be the private citizens

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
who make the decisions
such as this.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.990 align:middle line:84%
NASA should actually
get out of the way.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:84%
NASA's been in the way for
about 40 years now, George.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:84%
They have been reluctant to
let any private companies run

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:90%
the show.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And instead, they've
tried to dictate terms

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and the result is we
haven't got much done.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
In the last five,
six years, they've

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.450 align:middle line:84%
been forced to hand over
ownership of these rockets

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:90%
and cargo capability

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Reluctantly, you think?

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.161 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Reluctantly.

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:24.667 align:middle line:84%
Oh, without question,
as management--

00:14:24.667 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
there are people at NASA
who are in favor of this,

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.820 align:middle line:84%
but there are a lot
of people in NASA

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
who have been opposed to
it because it's a turf war.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
That's been their turf,
they've controlled it,

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and now they're
being told, no, you

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
won't own the rockets
for capsules anymore,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:90%
other companies will.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And some people in
NASA don't like that.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't like that.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: And
they fought this.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a power play.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.502 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's a power play.

00:14:42.502 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:90%
But they're losing.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.180 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
losing this battle.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Right now we have--

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BOB ZIMMERMAN: Is
it because of money?

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's
money, it's turf war.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.369 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of it has to do
with just simply NASA-- a lot

00:14:52.369 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:84%
of the engineers at
NASA, they'd like

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:90%
to build the rockets themselves.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:90%
They'd like to.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're good
engineers at NASA.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But aren't
those people getting

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:90%
hired by the private companies?

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.945 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: They have to
be willing to leave NASA.

00:15:01.945 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: A lot
of the people who

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
work for NASA-- when you've
got a good government

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.931 align:middle line:84%
job with a good pension,
you don't want to leave.

00:15:06.931 --> 00:15:08.206 align:middle line:90%
So you stay there.

00:15:08.206 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:84%
You keep your pension,
but then if NASA's not

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.163 align:middle line:84%
building the rockets
anymore, you're not building.

00:15:12.163 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Then it becomes
this moral dilemma.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Do I go where the cool work is?

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Or do I stay here
with the good pension?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's a tough
decision for a lot.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tough call.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: So a lot
of those NASA people

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
stay there and then fight
to keep the work at NASA.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of the
people say, no, I'd

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.444 align:middle line:90%
rather be building rockets.

00:15:26.444 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And they go off and
they build the rockets.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.421 align:middle line:10%
In the next five
years, we're going

00:15:30.421 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:10%
to have private companies
launching humans into space.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.330 align:middle line:10%
Private companies building
rockets, for profit,

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.920 align:middle line:10%
putting humans into space.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is going
to be incredibly

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.860 align:middle line:90%
exciting and different.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
be doing it for profit.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of it's going to be just
put tourists up in space.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Some of it will be
to put astronauts up

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.990 align:middle line:90%
in space for the government.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
In this case, NASA is
just a customer, George.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.335 align:middle line:84%
All that they're
doing is they need

00:15:56.335 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:84%
a way to get their
astronauts to ISS so they

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
buy the services from
a private company.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.839 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Some
of those companies

00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:04.010 align:middle line:90%
come like Dream Chaser.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Dream Chaser is a privately
built mini shuttle

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's designed merely
to be able-- it's reusable,

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:84%
it's designed to just bring
people up and down from ISS.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:90%
It could also bring cargo.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
It's being built by a private
company, Sierra Nevada.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.215 align:middle line:84%
And for the purposes of getting
humans into space, for NASA,

00:16:23.215 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:90%
to get their customers.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's perfect.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.098 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's perfect
but, you know, once they've

00:16:27.098 --> 00:16:29.130 align:middle line:84%
got it operating and
they've got this spaceship,

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
they can sell the
services to others.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
You can start putting
tourists into space.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:10%
>>ZIMMERMAN: You've got a
private company, Bigelow,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:10%
that has its own modules.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.115 align:middle line:10%
They want to put
a space station.

00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It wants a hotel.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:38.590 align:middle line:10%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's a hotel.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:10%
It wants to have a hotel.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:10%
Well now you have
Dream Chaser could

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.200 align:middle line:10%
provide the transportation
to get them to the hotel.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.260 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to see
private enterprise

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.130 align:middle line:84%
in orbit irrelevant
of the government.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.159 align:middle line:84%
And then since there
are a lot more people

00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:52.200 align:middle line:84%
than there are governments
in the United States--

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.366 align:middle line:84%
there's only one government,
the federal government,

00:16:54.366 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
but there's 250
million people-- you

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
get a lot more dreams and
ideas and possibilities.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the future is-- the
sky's the limit at that point.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bob, NASA seems to be
concentrating on rover missions

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.167 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't the private
companies done that yet?

00:17:11.167 --> 00:17:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well, that's
an interesting question.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.480 align:middle line:10%
You know the guy who
runs SpaceX, Elon Musk,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.210 align:middle line:10%
he started out wanting-- when
he sold Paypal and he was now

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:10%
a billionaire and he
had money to spare

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:10%
and he really was interested
in space exploration--

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:10%
his first idea was he was going
to build his own privately

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.214 align:middle line:10%
built probe lander to Mars.

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:10%
And that was what
he wanted to do.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's what he wanted.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.578 align:middle line:10%
>>ZIMMERMAN: He
wanted to do first,

00:17:32.578 --> 00:17:34.550 align:middle line:10%
go to Mars with a
private unmanned probe.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
What he discovered was he could
afford to build the probe,

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.590 align:middle line:84%
but he found he couldn't
afford to launch it.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the light
bulb went off and he said, oh.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.726 align:middle line:84%
There's money to be made
in the launch market

00:17:45.726 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:90%
because nobody's competing.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:47.766 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: So will
private enterprise

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.243 align:middle line:84%
eventually start doing
those kind of things?

00:17:51.243 --> 00:17:52.320 align:middle line:90%
I think they will.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.119 align:middle line:84%
For example, once you start
having hotels in orbit,

00:17:55.119 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:84%
well the next step for a private
company will say, hey, maybe

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.245 align:middle line:84%
we can make money having
tourists on the moon.

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, then private
companies have

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:84%
to start sending rovers to
the moon to do some research.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Where you going to
build your hotel?

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.286 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:18:06.286 --> 00:18:09.396 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: So you start to
have private space doing that.

00:18:09.396 --> 00:18:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's
even happening now.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Google XPRIZE is going
on, Google Lunar XPRIZE.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.690 align:middle line:84%
That is actually
private companies--

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this part
of the old XPRIZE group?

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.563 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's the
next second generation

00:18:21.563 --> 00:18:22.360 align:middle line:90%
of the same XPRIZE.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, by 2015 put
an unmanned lander on the moon,

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.800 align:middle line:84%
travel 500 feet--
500 meters, I'm

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:84%
sorry-- and then send that
information back to Earth.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.800 align:middle line:84%
There are about 20
private companies

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
trying to build those
rovers right now.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's at least
three, I think,

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
have a credible chance
of actually putting

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:90%
a rover on the moon by 2015.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that's privately
built, privately funded.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.909 align:middle line:84%
And so, once again, what's the
purpose of that some of it's

00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
going to be they'll
have little telescopes,

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.414 align:middle line:84%
you could actually
look at space.

00:18:56.414 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, be an
amateur astronomer

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and buy time on the telescope.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of them they're doing
tests, test mineralogy.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.779 align:middle line:84%
Because if a private hotel
wants to be built there,

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
they got to know where
to build it and how.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think, yes,
private enterprise

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:84%
has the highest
potential of doing this.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
You know what the best
benefit of private enterprise

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:90%
is, George?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:90%
It's free.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is free.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's free.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:90%
And that sounds strange.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:84%
No, it still costs
money, doesn't it?

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, it does.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:90%
But you see--

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But not
from our pockets.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: No, it's
not from our pocket.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.426 align:middle line:84%
The only people
who pay for it are

00:19:25.426 --> 00:19:27.390 align:middle line:90%
the ones who want to pay for it.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.547 align:middle line:84%
So if I give you
an example, NASA,

00:19:29.547 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:90%
they've got to take tax dollars.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't want
to pay that money.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And so people argue about
well we should do it or not,

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and then it gets
into big politics.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Private company, they sell
tickets to people who buy it,

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:90%
willingly give the money.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.135 align:middle line:84%
The company that launches the
tourists, they make a profit.

00:19:44.135 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't cost
them anything.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:90%
They've made a profit.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They can funnel
some of that profit

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.707 align:middle line:84%
back into upgrading
and new designs.

00:19:50.707 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
It's still doesn't
cost them anything.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:84%
They sell more tickets, that
gives them investment capital.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's free in the sense and
the potential then is endless,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
because as long as you can
provide a product that people

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:84%
will buy-- and people
want to buy this--

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:84%
you can go for as
far as you want.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And so orbital space
hotels may be first,

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:84%
but later it will be-- wouldn't
it be nice to do a hike?

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do a weekend on Mars?

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Do a
weekend on Mars.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.862 align:middle line:84%
You know, walk along the
rim of Copernicus Crater

00:20:17.862 --> 00:20:18.570 align:middle line:90%
and see the view.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:90%
That would be spectacular.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And people would--
once it's established,

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.822 align:middle line:84%
people will want to do this
kind of thing without question.

00:20:24.822 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 5 years?

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:90%
10 years?

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:90%
20 years?

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:90%
How far out?

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well, we're
in a transition zone

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.361 align:middle line:90%
right now in the United States.

00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:84%
We're switching from the
government model, the program

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.450 align:middle line:84%
model-- you know, government
space program where everything

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is dictated-- and it's switching
over now private enterprise,

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:84%
which is more like
a space effort.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of chaotic--
no one program, no one

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
idea, many different people
with many different efforts.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:84%
That transition is
going to take probably

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:90%
through the end of this decade.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:84%
But by the end of
this decade, by 2020,

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
firmly entrenched

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that private companies will
be doing this for profit.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And once that happens,
the sky is the limit.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, it's funny to
say but it's really true.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that's going
to stop it at that point

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:84%
because once there's profit
being made sending people

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.287 align:middle line:84%
into space, well then
you can do anything.

00:21:10.287 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: And so then
in the '20s, in the '30s,

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
you're going to start to see
some really incredible things

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.780 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.821 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
Chinese and the Russians?

00:21:17.821 --> 00:21:19.623 align:middle line:84%
They don't seem to be
private, doing this.

00:21:19.623 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: No, that's right.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
They're still following
the government model,

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:90%
the centralized top-down system.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we will continue
to have a military application

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:90%
there right?

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.943 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We will,
there's no question.

00:21:29.943 --> 00:21:31.702 align:middle line:90%
You have security issues there.

00:21:31.702 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians and
the Chinese, they're

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
competing with our private
companies in a sense.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.640 align:middle line:84%
They're just another
competing company, in a sense,

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:84%
but they seem to
think the best way

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:84%
to do it is from a government
model, work from the top down.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.690 align:middle line:90%
I wish them well.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I think the problem with that
is you're never as efficient,

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:84%
you're never as
effective, and in the end

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:84%
multiple competing private
companies for profit

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.060 align:middle line:90%
are going to wipe you out.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:84%
You're just not going
to be able to compete.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you're right.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: That's at least
that's how I look at it.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why aren't we
working together closer

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.532 align:middle line:84%
with the Russians
and the Chinese?

00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well, you
know, we work incredibly

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:84%
close with the Russians on the
International Space Station.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we
need them to get up.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.458 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: We
need to get them up

00:22:11.458 --> 00:22:13.180 align:middle line:84%
but they need us to
operate the station.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:90%
We provide the electrical power.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
It is a mutual hands
closely grasped.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
They cannot work
separate from each other.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:84%
If the Russians
said, we're not going

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:84%
to take your astronauts up there
anymore, well we would say,

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, well we're going to
shut the station down.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we have no choice.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well the
point is and they could not

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.792 align:middle line:84%
stop us because we control
the power systems on it.

00:22:33.792 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:90%
So it's a mutual thing.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
We work close
together with them,

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
but the irony of that
close mutual cooperation

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:90%
is that not that much gets done.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
There are too many people
involved in the game.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
Russians have wanted--

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
they have good experience
on space stations,

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
they understand the
space station's design,

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:84%
space station is
how you learn how

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.806 align:middle line:84%
to build interplanetary
space ships.

00:22:56.806 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:90%
They understand that.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So they've wanted to do
year-long missions on ISS

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.582 align:middle line:90%
now for the last decade.

00:23:02.582 --> 00:23:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have been fighting
with the United States and NASA

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:90%
for a decade, who says no.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.964 align:middle line:90%
NASA didn't want to do it.

00:23:07.964 --> 00:23:09.046 align:middle line:90%
Just didn't want to do it.

00:23:09.046 --> 00:23:09.671 align:middle line:90%
It's too risky.

00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:11.129 align:middle line:84%
The bureaucracy at
NASA just didn't

00:23:11.129 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:90%
want to take the extra chance.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So for a decade this
cooperative effort

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:90%
wasn't getting much done.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Well finally, a year
ago, NASA finally

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:90%
agreed to a year-long mission.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to see a
year-long mission next year

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.450 align:middle line:84%
on ISS, with an American
and Russian astronaut.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're going
to stay for a year.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: They're
going to stay for a year.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to
simulate what it

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:84%
would be like to travel
to Mars and back.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:90%
What does it do to the body?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't
they go crazy, Bob?

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: No, not at all.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.746 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: No.

00:23:37.746 --> 00:23:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, human
beings were traveling

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.520 align:middle line:84%
across the ocean, whalers would
go out for a year and a half.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.410 align:middle line:90%
They don't go crazy.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:84%
People are more
resilient than that.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think our
generation is influenced

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.876 align:middle line:84%
by lot of bad science
fiction from the '50s, which

00:23:52.876 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:90%
said people would go crazy.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:90%
People won't go crazy.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.805 align:middle line:84%
But there are issues
you need to learn.

00:23:56.805 --> 00:23:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There are issues.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: There are issues.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.440 align:middle line:84%
There are issues
of medical, body--

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.066 align:middle line:84%
the body has problems
with weightlessness.

00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:04.690 align:middle line:84%
We need to learn how
to deal with that.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you need
a year-long mission.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:84%
But this gets back to why
the cooperation is a problem,

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.006 align:middle line:84%
because it took almost
a decade of negotiation.

00:24:14.006 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It took 10
years to go for one year.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: To go for one year.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And what really should
have been happening

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
is from day one we
should've been upping

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:25.156 align:middle line:84%
the lengths of missions on ISS
to one year, to two years--

00:24:25.156 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.029 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: --to three years.

00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And so you get a--
it takes three years

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:90%
to do a three-year mission.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, we spent a decade
on ISS without doing that.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Now we got to start doing it.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.920 align:middle line:90%
We lose time by wasting time.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.670 align:middle line:84%
You have your-- for
example, the Russians,

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.253 align:middle line:84%
when they had their
own space station,

00:24:39.253 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:90%
they didn't do it cooperatively.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.485 align:middle line:84%
They ramped up the
lengths of their missions.

00:24:42.485 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They did year-long
missions on Mir.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And the Chinese with
their space station

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.823 align:middle line:84%
are probably going to do
the year-long missions.

00:24:47.823 --> 00:24:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
building one too?

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.093 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: They're
building one too.

00:24:50.093 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
They did their first
prototype modules in orbit.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:84%
They've done two
missions to that module.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:90%
They're going to do one more.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.073 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
going to follow it up

00:24:57.073 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:84%
with a Mir-like upgrade
which, once again, is designed

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.650 align:middle line:84%
with the idea that it's an
interplanetary spaceship

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:90%
prototype.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:90%
How do you build--

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that why
they're building these ISS?

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: No, well that's
the funny story, George.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:84%
A space station really is
a prototype interplanetary

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:90%
spaceship.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:84%
This is what leaving
Earth all about.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.137 align:middle line:84%
What leaving Earth
was all about.

00:25:20.137 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:90%
So you have to be aware of that.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.017 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to put human
beings in Earth for a year,

00:25:24.017 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:84%
or six months, the only reason
you're doing it right now

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:84%
is to learn the medical
and engineering facts

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.060 align:middle line:84%
you need to know to
build a spaceship,

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.360 align:middle line:90%
an interplanetary spaceship.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So Mir was built
with that in mind.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese space station is
being built with that in mind.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
politics at NASA,

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.260 align:middle line:84%
ISS was not built
with that in mind.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.280 align:middle line:84%
ISS is very closely
tied to the ground.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
You have computer
systems, mission control

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.369 align:middle line:90%
runs that station.

00:25:49.369 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're building
interplanetary spaceship

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and you want to go to Mars, that
ship orbiting Mars cannot be

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:90%
run from the ground on Earth.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It has to be
independent of that.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense,
ISS is a failure.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:84%
It never can tell
us what we need

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:84%
to know to build an
interplanetary spaceship.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's easier
to launch from space.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Absolutely

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:10.466 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To go to Mars, right?

00:26:10.466 --> 00:26:11.549 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: That's right.

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the idea is you assemble
your spaceship in Earth orbit,

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and once assembled,
it's much easier

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.336 align:middle line:84%
then to attach rockets and send
it out to the other planets.

00:26:20.336 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds monumental.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It is monu-- but,
you know, it's what humans do.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I think we should do
monumental things.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is an example
of that monumentalness.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And from ISS we can
learn a great deal

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:84%
about how to build an
interplanetary spaceship,

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.470 align:middle line:84%
but we're always going to have
some difficulties because some

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.364 align:middle line:84%
of the engineering is
not focused on that.

00:26:38.364 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's our
limitation unfortunately.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.737 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you fuel
a spacecraft like that?

00:26:42.737 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: How would you fuel?

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean it depends
on how it's built.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.250 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, for
electrical power

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:90%
they focus on solar power.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But once you get out farther
into the solar system,

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.877 align:middle line:84%
you get too far
away from the sun,

00:26:53.877 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:90%
solar power is not as efficient.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not going to work.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's
not going to work.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they use
the small nuclear powered

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:90%
electrical generators.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.466 align:middle line:84%
That's what Cassini
around Saturn uses.

00:27:03.466 --> 00:27:05.965 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Jupiter orbiter
that's on its way to Jupiter

00:27:05.965 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
seem to last forever.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.016 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: They can
last up to 30, 40 years.

00:27:09.016 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:84%
It's very robust
technology right now,

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:90%
we know how to use it.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:90%
So that's another possibility.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But you have other issues
that are much more difficult.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:90%
You have to deal with radiation.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.652 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
go to-- if you're

00:27:20.652 --> 00:27:23.630 align:middle line:84%
going to travel outside the
Van Allen belts that protect us

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth's magnetic
field, then the human beings,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have some kind
of shielding in that spaceship

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.720 align:middle line:84%
to protect the
humans while they're

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.440 align:middle line:90%
traveling from planet to planet.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Well how do we build that?

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:84%
We actually don't
know right now.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We don't know.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: The
Russians learned on Mir

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.380 align:middle line:84%
that you could actually
use the storage

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
batteries of your solar panels
as shielding because they're

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:84%
lead acid batteries
and they actually

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.830 align:middle line:90%
protect you from the radiation.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So they did is they concentrated
the batteries on one

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.297 align:middle line:90%
particular module.

00:27:52.297 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And if there was going
to be a solar flare--

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's where they go.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.215 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Asutronauts
would go into that module.

00:27:57.215 --> 00:27:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's one possible
solution to this,

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.920 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot more
research that has to be done.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Then there's the medical issues.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Weightlessness, you
start to lose bone mass.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.159 align:middle line:84%
Your bones start
to become brittle.

00:28:09.159 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:84%
You go for a long enough period
of time in weightlessness you

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.930 align:middle line:90%
cannot come back to Earth.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.920 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn how to
solve that problem before we

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.420 align:middle line:90%
can go explore space.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's
a real problem.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It's an
absolutely real problem,

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:90%
there's no question about it.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:84%
ISS, some of the research
that's going on right now,

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.130 align:middle line:84%
is going to teach us how
to solve that problem.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.754 align:middle line:84%
And that will actually
be good for here

00:28:23.754 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:90%
on Earth-- osteoporosis.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It has direct bearings.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.402 align:middle line:84%
If you can learn how to keep the
bones strong in weightlessness,

00:28:30.402 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:84%
you're probably
also going to learn

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
how to keep the bones
strong when you get old.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And supplements
alone won't help, will they?

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well
right now supplements

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.340 align:middle line:84%
have been tried with the
Russians and the Americans

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and they have some bonus
but they don't quite

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.419 align:middle line:90%
solve the problem.

00:28:47.419 --> 00:28:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Exercise seems to help
but it doesn't quite

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:49.990 align:middle line:90%
solve the problem.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a major medical problem
that has to researched.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.624 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were humans
made to travel in space?

00:28:54.624 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: It appears not.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.307 align:middle line:90%
That's the issue.

00:28:57.307 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the issue.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.681 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: There are issues
of cardiovascular system,

00:29:00.681 --> 00:29:03.490 align:middle line:90%
the balance system of the body.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the bones, they
can become brittle and weak.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
issues that-- the vision.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.846 align:middle line:84%
We're finding out
that weightlessness

00:29:12.846 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
seems to have a very deleterious
effect on astronaut vision.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Some astronauts have had
serious vision problems.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Research can solve
these problems,

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.575 align:middle line:84%
but we need to do that
research starting now.

00:29:23.575 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well maybe we weren't
made to leave the planet, Bob.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Oh, are you saying
that if God had given us wings

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:90%
we would fly.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'd be flying.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.692 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well, that's--

00:29:32.692 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like gossamer.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.191 align:middle line:84%
>>ZIMMERMAN: Well,
you see, the thing

00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:39.310 align:middle line:84%
is what did Asimo-- what
did Robert Clock say?

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:43.390 align:middle line:84%
When a scientist says it's
impossible, it's impossible,

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.190 align:middle line:84%
he just means it's going to take
a little bit longer to solve.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:50.879 align:middle line:84%
And so human beings, a man's
reach should exceed his grasp,

00:29:50.879 --> 00:29:51.920 align:middle line:90%
but what's a heavens for?

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:84%
We want to try to reach
for greater things.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So these are
obstacles in our way.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
It's behind the black,
George, once again.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:90%
So, yes.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We find out that
weightlessness is not

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:90%
a good thing for the human body.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Well that doesn't mean
we should give up.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.910 align:middle line:10%
That means we should
reach behind the black

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:10%
to try to figure
out how to solve it.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.697 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:30:14.697 --> 00:30:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: I know you'd agree.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Human beings are adaptable,
that's our greatest strength.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we find a
problem, solve the problem.

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Don't let it bother
you, solve the problem.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what space is
teaching us in this case.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
universe out there

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:33.770 align:middle line:84%
for us to inhabit and
explore and enjoy.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
let's not stop here.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.755 align:middle line:84%
Let's get there so we can learn
how to take advantage of it.

00:30:38.755 --> 00:30:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bob
Zimmerman, thank you

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.350 align:middle line:90%
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ZIMMERMAN: My pleasure.

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:42.978 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Appreciate it.

00:30:42.978 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:10%
So maybe one day mankind
will indeed leave the planet.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.090 align:middle line:10%
Then again, maybe not.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:53.560 --> 00:31:09.675 align:middle line:90%
