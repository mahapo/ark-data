go in and do a triple bypass

on somebody's heart

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm like a surgeon but I'm
doing everything energetically.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I see, hear, feel,
smell, and weirdly taste

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:90%
everything in the unseen world.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we do create
illness in our body.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:84%
It is karmic, it is
related to past lives.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's also related
to this lifetime.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Our first and foremost
important relationship

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
that we have being infinite
souls having a human experience

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:90%
is with the planet.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.593 align:middle line:90%

>>GRACE: If we can connect that
strongly with a feeling, fear,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:84%
we can connect that
strongly with inner peace.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:84%
I believe there has
been alien intervention

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
on this planet
for centuries that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:90%
is trying to control humanity.

What a great guest
we have for you now.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:10%
Sonja Grace is an
author, mystic healer,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:10%
and a time traveler who works
long distance with clients

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:10%
all over the planet.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.737 align:middle line:90%
Sonja, welcome back.

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Thanks for
having me, George.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has it
been technology that

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:84%
allows you to communicate
long distance with people?

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: You know, George,
when I work with people,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:10%
I'm on the phone, and
I work long distance,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:10%
but I'm able to
defy time and space

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:10%
and basically put myself
in front of that person

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:10%
and work on their heart, their
liver, their spleen, kidneys,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of
disease and illness.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not dependent
upon the phone.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Some people I just get a picture
of them and a list of ailments,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.798 align:middle line:84%
and I know where they are in the
world, and I just work on them.

00:01:57.798 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
talk about mystic healing,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.240 align:middle line:90%
what exactly are you doing here?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Well, being a time
traveler or a spirit traveler,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm basically like
a mystic in that I'm

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:10%
able to see into things,
I'm able to perceive what's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:10%
going on, and as a healer,
I am defined time and space

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.580 align:middle line:10%
and going in and working
on people as if they

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:10%
were right in front of me.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.787 align:middle line:84%
So put that together
you have mystic healer.

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you say
going in and working on them,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
you're not physically
operating on people,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.180 align:middle line:90%
you're not there to touch them.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you bring this
energy to help them?

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: It's like
being an energy

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
surgeon to coin your phrase
of me several years ago.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like I literally go
in and do a triple bypass

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:84%
on somebody's heart
and put a stent in,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and I sew up the hernia and
put a little mesh in there

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:90%
to keep it in.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like a surgeon, but I'm
doing everything energetically.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it has to pass
through that person's ego

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
their physical, mental,
emotional, and spiritual body.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they need
to believe in you?

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I think that people
have much easier opportunity

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.072 align:middle line:84%
to receive the healing if they
are open to what's being done.

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And more
acceptable to it.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, sure.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I was born this way.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:90%
I've really been all systems on.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I see, hear, feel,
smell, and weirdly taste

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.370 align:middle line:90%
everything in the unseen world.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So I am dialed in since
birth, and I slowly over time

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
learned how to corral
those gifts by working

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.220 align:middle line:90%
with really good teachers.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it genetic?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I think my
father was very, very tuned in.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that he and my
grandmother and actually

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.238 align:middle line:84%
on my mom's side
too had quite a bit.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been doing
this for how many years now?

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Oh, George!

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm only 24.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:90%
I've been working--

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been working as a
healer for 40 years now.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not bad.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not bad.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Give me an example of what
you've done for somebody.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.705 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Well, let me say--

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When they come,
do they come to you first?

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They come
to me, they find me.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And most people
find me on Gaia TV,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and they are able to book an
appointment on my website,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
they call me, they email me,
and then we go from there

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:90%
and we set up the appointment.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I work with
someone, I am helping them

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
with the physical, mental,
emotional, and spiritual.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.895 align:middle line:84%
So if someone
calls me and says--

00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All at the same time?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Sure.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.530 align:middle line:84%
If someone calls me and
says, I'm dealing with cancer

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and I really need
you to work on me.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
of course, I'm going
to work on them.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to work on actually
energetically excavating

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:90%
that cancer out of the body.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, I'm
going to go in and help

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
them to discover what is
the emotional content that

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
has brought this illness
about, because our body is

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.893 align:middle line:84%
like the warehouse of all
of our emotional stuff.

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In addition to
what you do with them,

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.102 align:middle line:84%
do you still recommend that
they stay with their doctor

00:05:15.102 --> 00:05:16.935 align:middle line:84%
and take their medicine,
and all that stuff?

00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I am a
huge fan of everyone

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:90%
working in all modalities.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:10%
Go to your Western medicine
doctor, get the scans done,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.827 align:middle line:10%
find out what's going on.

00:05:28.827 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Go to the
naturopath, get the herbs,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
go to the herbalist, go to
the acupuncturist, come to me,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.800 align:middle line:84%
do the emotional work, get
some healing work, all of it.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.562 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do everything you can.

00:05:41.562 --> 00:05:42.395 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:05:42.395 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
important thing.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Everything.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think people
understand this personally

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:90%
for themselves?

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I do.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that people
oftentimes have--

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.430 align:middle line:90%
they have a hunch.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:84%
They feel like I think
there's something that's

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
not quite right with my body
or something's going on,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:90%
and they call--

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then you could tell.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They call
me and they'll

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.590 align:middle line:84%
say, "no, I haven't
really been to a doctor,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:84%
but I've got this pain and
I don't know what it is."

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How soon do people
get healed with what you do?

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Well, it depends.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I have had people have
healing right then and there.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:90%
They feel better.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I have people the next day,
I have clients who tell me,

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:84%
"Sonja, it's always
two days later,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.820 align:middle line:90%
and I totally feel different."

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And I've had other
people call me

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:90%
and say two weeks, two months.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:90%
It just kicked in.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Everything just changed.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.667 align:middle line:84%
So it just depends
on the person.

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:39.125 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
work all the time?

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: You know,
George, I tell all--

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tough question.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I know.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I tell all my clients, it's
God's will, it's not mine.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I show up clear, I show
up as a very clear vessel

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:84%
to channel and bring that
energy in and I do the work.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's God's
will, it's not mine.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have an
inner peace about you

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:90%
when you're working on people.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:90%
How does that work for you?

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I
teach people how

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.790 align:middle line:90%
to access their inner peace.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And through 40
years of meditation,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I've really come to understand
that although I grew up

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
at a time when peace
was really important

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and give peace a chance
and you and I can think

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds of songs
about peace, Vietnam War,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:84%
all of the things that brought
about people wanting peace,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I believe peace really
exists within us.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:90%
It's inside our soul body.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a series
called "The Earth Angel

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Diaries."

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: We don't
understand peace

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:10%
if we have not necessarily
experienced disruption

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:10%
and not being peaceful.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people
come from countries

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:10%
that are war torn and
post-traumatic stress

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:10%
and everything that
is opposite of peace.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:10%
And we have had for centuries
disruption and war, famine,

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:10%
plague, you name
it, it has kept us

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:18.430 align:middle line:10%
from this desire, this feeling
of wanting to have peace.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:10%
So here we are today,
plague, disruption,

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.770 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of things
going on around the world

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.080 align:middle line:10%
and we are looking for peace.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:10%
So how do we find that?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:10%
How do we get back to
our own inner peace?

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:10%
This is inside your soul body.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:10%
Your soul body
inhabits your body.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:10%
At the very center of your
soul body is inner peace.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:10%
So instead of looking outside
of ourselves for peace,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.950 align:middle line:10%
we need to go within
and we need to connect

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:10%
with this inner peace
through meditation.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.737 align:middle line:10%
What pulls us out of
that feeling of peace,

00:08:59.737 --> 00:09:02.070 align:middle line:10%
you know what it's like when
you walk through the garden

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:10%
and you feel so peaceful.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:10%
The birds are singing, there's
hummingbirds coming by,

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:10%
it's such a peaceful feeling.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:10%
What takes us out
of that dysfunction?

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.240 align:middle line:10%
When we aren't focusing
ourselves in a way

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:10%
that helps us to
stay in that peace,

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:10%
but rather we get addicted
to the shock and the fear

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.660 align:middle line:10%
and the betrayal and
all the things that

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:10%
were, "oh, my God,
tell me that again.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:10%
Oh, it was way too scary,
but I want to hear it again."

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:40.010 align:middle line:10%
We're addicted to a part of
the pattern and cycle that

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:10%
is not about peace, but rather
disruption and shock and fear.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:10%
So in order to get out of those
feelings, we must ground them.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:10%
You've got to feel them.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:10%
You have them.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:10%
Feel them, let them go
deep into the Earth.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:10%
Just ground them into the Earth,
then get back to your peace,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.200 align:middle line:10%
get back to that
place inside of you

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:10%
where you can actually
expand and flow

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:10%
and let it fill up
your whole field.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it sounds
like, Sonja, tranquility

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.080 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It's very important.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
the soul body inhabiting

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:84%
this physical body,
it is infinite.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:84%
We have always been,
we will always be.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Our souls simply inhabit
this physical form.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So the soul has at the very
center of it inner peace.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.510 align:middle line:84%
It is an infinite amount of
peace within each one of us.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And if we tap into that, if we
really spend time with that,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and when then we learn
how to expand that

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and expand it so far that we
expanded around the world,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:90%
we can have peace.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But it takes everybody
getting to the point

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.890 align:middle line:84%
of their willing to
do the inner work,

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:84%
are willing to excavate
the fear, the anxiety,

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:84%
the rejection, abandonment,
and all of the emotional wounds

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:90%
that we carry.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it doesn't work for
someone, if it doesn't work,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:90%
what are they doing wrong?

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, if
it doesn't work,

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.160 align:middle line:84%
I suggest they call
me for one and--

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Quickly.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, and
for two, I think

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:84%
that the whole reason
this has come up,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:84%
George, is the meditation
peace project, which

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:84%
is what I started to help
people to get to this.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a matter
of not working,

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:84%
it's a matter of getting
people together so that they

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
can learn how to find that
inner peace within themselves.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to get
into the meditation peace

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:84%
process in a moment
here, because it's

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:84%
an incredible thing
that you've developed.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:84%
But with disease specifically,
do we bring it on ourselves?

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Why are some people sick
and some people aren't?

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Right.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
responsibility.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Are we taught in our society
to take responsibility

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:90%
for our health.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.130 align:middle line:90%
No, not really.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:90%
We're told to go to the doctor.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.250 align:middle line:84%
The doctor doesn't
really tell you

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.790 align:middle line:84%
what's going on unless you know
how to ask the right questions.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
prescribed a medicine

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that the doctor says, "oh no,
this will take care of it."

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it probably doesn't

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.488 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: And so there is no--

00:12:26.488 --> 00:12:29.060 align:middle line:84%
yeah, and so there's
no responsibility

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.910 align:middle line:84%
of that person
learning, "oh, this

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:84%
is where my liver, this is
what my liver function is,

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and if my liver
gets too gunked up,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.210 align:middle line:84%
my gallbladder is
going to crap out on me

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to end
up with acid reflux,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
because that's really
where it comes from."

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.940 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're not
taught these things.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to me that
people take responsibility,

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:84%
because, yes, we do create
illness in our body.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
It is karmic, it is
related to past lives,

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's also related
to this lifetime.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you deal with
what is called the soul body?

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.737 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:13:05.737 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: The soul body is what
inhabits your physical body.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.148 align:middle line:84%
It is infinite, it has always
been, it will always be.

00:13:14.148 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it take precedent
over the physical body?

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or does it
work in tandem with it?

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: It works
in tandem with it.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But George, if you've ever
been around anyone who has died

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:84%
you know that body has a
completely different look.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:90%
It's lifeless.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
There is something really
important that's missing,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's because the
soul has left the body.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.322 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's gone.

00:13:38.322 --> 00:13:40.170 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend die a
couple of years ago,

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:90%
and he died foolishly.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:90%
He overprescribed himself.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And then at the funeral, you
look at this body and you go,

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:90%
"this is not him."

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:84%
There's something missing,
and it's probably the soul.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It is the soul.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.285 align:middle line:84%
It's the most powerful
thing about who we are.

00:14:01.285 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we're not going
to physically live forever.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:84%
How can we make
our life the best

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:90%
we can while we're still here.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I believe
it's important

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that people learn
why we're here,

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and that is to work
through our karma,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.930 align:middle line:84%
to work through all
of the lifetimes

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:90%
that we've had here on Earth.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And the more that we
work on that, meaning we

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:84%
address the emotional
wounds that we

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
hold in this lifetime
and past lives.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Then we start to become
clearer and able to address

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:90%
things and not get triggered.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.610 align:middle line:84%
When we can address things
or experience something--

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.820 align:middle line:84%
your mom walks in the room, and
she says something to you that

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:90%
normally would trigger you.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Only this time now
it didn't trigger you

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:84%
because you've learned
where that trigger is,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:84%
you've learned what
the emotional wound is,

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and now you're sitting in a
third place, which is peace.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:90%
That's that inner peace, George.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:08.750 align:middle line:84%
It is a third
place from duality.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's good
and bad, right and wrong,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:90%
it's a third place to sit-in.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And that third place
inner peace allows

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:90%
us to observe everything.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:84%
We no longer are
getting triggered.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.803 align:middle line:84%
We're simply observing the
duality that's going on.

00:15:24.803 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It just came
out with a study, Sonja,

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:84%
that said that
loneliness can literally

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:90%
take five years off your life.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
By being lonely, specifically
older people when

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:84%
they get to 50, 60, 70 years
old, the lonelier they are,

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.920 align:middle line:84%
the quicker their
lifespan goes down.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, because
people are not connecting.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Our first and foremost
important relationship

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that we have being
infinite souls,

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:84%
having a human experience
is with the planet.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:90%
It's with her.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:84%
We should be connecting our
energy to the planet every day.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.302 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:16:04.302 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Grounding ourselves.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Number one, absolutely.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Going outside, I mean, think
of all the conversations

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:90%
people have on their phones.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
They're talking,
talking, talking.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Go outside and
talk to the Earth,

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
sit-in front of a big rock,
sit-in front of a tree.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you
think it's crazy.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Talk to the planet.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:90%
She is working with us.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do we say?

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.185 align:middle line:90%
What do I say to a rock?

00:16:26.185 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Do you do
you realize, George,

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
in the old days before
phones and everything else,

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:90%
that's what people did.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
They took their
sorrow and their pain

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.143 align:middle line:84%
and they went out to the
Earth and they prayed.

00:16:37.143 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:90%
That is what they did.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.643 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
does that do for us?

00:16:39.643 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Well, she hears us.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.770 align:middle line:84%
She is as much of a soul
in a body as we are.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:46.665 align:middle line:90%
She's a--

00:16:46.665 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ironically,
she's called Gaia.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Right.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And she's a benevolent being.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are chakras?

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Chakras are
energy centers that govern

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.310 align:middle line:90%
different parts of the body.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I work with the seven chakras,
the seven main chakras.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where?

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Can you point to yourself?

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Sure.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
The first one inserts where you
sit, second one is your belly,

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:84%
third is your solar plexus,
fourth is your heart,

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
fifth your throat, six
to third eye, seventh

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.210 align:middle line:90%
the top of the head.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: These are like points?

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: These are
big energy wheels that

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:90%
spin really fast clockwise.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And like tubular
flowers they hook

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:84%
in to the main
central line which

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:90%
is the vertical power current.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's what governs
all of your body

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and your health and everything
that makes you work.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Another Gaia
program is called

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.780 align:middle line:84%
"Microdose" discussed
some interesting aspects

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:90%
about chakras and the soul.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1975, professor of
kinesiology at UCLA Dr.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:10%
Valerie Hunt recorded radiation
emanating from the body

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:10%
in areas that are traditionally
associated with the chakra

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:10%
points.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:10%
She also recorded sound
wave frequencies and colors

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:10%
associated with the
chakras, which corresponded

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:10%
to the colors that the
ancient Indian Hindu

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.240 align:middle line:10%
tradition established.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:10%
>>CYNDI DALE: Dr.
Valerie Hunt was actually

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:10%
able to record the chakras that
are, of course, in the body

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.440 align:middle line:10%
and they also extend
beyond the body

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:10%
and determine the colors of
them and the sounds of them.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.820 align:middle line:10%
We've proven that these
flow through the body.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:10%
>>DALE: We can't see
them with an X-ray,

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:10%
but scientists have used
radioactive isotopes

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:10%
to actually track the movement.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>> There have also been studies
on the energy channels that

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:84%
lead to the chakras called
nadis in the Indian tradition

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:84%
or meridians in the
Chinese tradition.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:10%
In the 1980s, two
French researchers

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.370 align:middle line:10%
injected radioactive techniques
into the accupoints of patients

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:10%
and used nuclear
scanning equipment

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:10%
to follow the flow
of technetium.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:84%
When the true accupoints
were injected,

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:84%
the radioactive technetium
followed the exact pathways

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:84%
as the acupuncture meridians
in the ancient charts

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:90%
of Chinese acupuncture.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:10%
The word chakra comes from
the Indian Sanskrit word

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.820 align:middle line:10%
for wheel, which describes
the owned vortex like energy

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:10%
centers along the Sushumna
nadi, which runs along

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:10%
the spine of the human body.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:84%
The chakras are essentially
storage places for vital energy

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
forces that connect the
physical body to the layers

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:90%
of the auric field.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:10%
Each chakra operates at
a specific frequency,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.200 align:middle line:10%
which determines its
color and characteristics.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:10%
Most familiar is the
seven chakra system

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.080 align:middle line:10%
starting with the root chakra
at the base of the spine

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:10%
and moving up to the crown
chakra at the top of the head.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
many more chakras

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:84%
that you can work with
in and around the body.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.347 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did our ancients
know about the chakra points?

00:19:44.347 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I think the
ancients knew a lot of things

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.847 align:middle line:84%
that we have become more
and more out of touch with.

00:19:48.847 --> 00:19:50.097 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you're right.

00:19:50.097 --> 00:19:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Let's talk about
the fact that the Great

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids are aligned
with Orion's belt.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about the
Hopi mesas being aligned

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:10%
with Orion's belt. Let's
talk about all the things

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.580 align:middle line:10%
on the planet that have an
alignment to these bigger

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:10%
systems just like we
have these systems

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:10%
in our body, the chakras,
the meridians, all of it.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.380 align:middle line:10%
I mean to me, it's
this incredible design

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.830 align:middle line:10%
from the universe that
reflects the universe.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
touch the chakras?

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.690 align:middle line:90%
I work in the chakras.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But when I work on people
being long distance,

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:84%
you could be where
you live in your home

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and I'm working on you, but
I'm right in front of you

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
working on you.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not touching it per
se, but I am working with it.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.603 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Am I feeling
different when you do that?

00:20:41.603 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, a lot of
people feel different.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I studied 40
years ago, my first teacher,

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:84%
we would have a group of people
who did hands on healing on one

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
group and a group of
people who did chakra

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.150 align:middle line:90%
healing on the other group.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And the people who got the
chakra healing always healed up

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:84%
faster than the people
with the hands on.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
Jesus practiced this?

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I think Jesus
knew a lot of things.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean he had the
God given power to be sure.

00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:08.768 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he knew about
healing and things like that.

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Sure.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He did
that all the time.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Sure.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think the ancient
people of that time and even

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
before that time, Sumerian time,
they knew about this stuff.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why don't we know this?

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.780 align:middle line:84%
People like you do,
but most people.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:84%
If you go out and
survey somebody,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.080 align:middle line:90%
they don't know about this.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Ask somebody what a
chakra is, they're

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:84%
going to think what
are you talking about.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: OK.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to something
that's even more important

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and what you just
asked me and that

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:84%
is, I believe there has
been alien intervention

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.710 align:middle line:84%
on this planet for centuries,
and that when Christianity

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
really took hold
1200 AD, and we kept

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:90%
going further into the 1400s.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're burning
women at the stake.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
We're tying women's big toes
and thumbs together in Scotland

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and dumping them into the moat
around Edinburgh, the castle.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So you've got all
these things happening,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:84%
to me, that is an influence
to control and manipulate.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like
today that I feel

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
there's a tremendous
influx of alien technology

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and alien intelligence that
is trying to control humanity.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a good way?

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:25.455 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No.

00:22:25.455 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No?

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Not in a good way.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.310 align:middle line:90%
Remember what I said.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:84%
We are infinite souls
having a human experience.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So another group, call
us aliens, I don't care.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I think the human species
has only been here

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.690 align:middle line:90%
since for 20 million years.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So you've got an alien
species that comes in.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:84%
They've got an agenda,
we have an agenda.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:55.170 align:middle line:84%
They want to somehow alter us
or change us or do some tissue

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.310 align:middle line:90%
samples and manipulation.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:90%
We do that.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:90%
We do that to other species.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of on
the same playing field,

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.280 align:middle line:84%
but they have a lot
more technology,

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and they've been here
for a long, long time.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So humans are like in
the state of amnesia.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Graham Hancock, and
we are trying to deal with, oh,

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:84%
let me remember, I've
had multiple past lives.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually an infinite soul
having a human experience.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And guess what,
I'm not a victim,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a victim to
my health, to my body,

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:90%
to being here on Earth.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
I simply need to
take responsibility.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is inner
peace mean to you?

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Inner peace is
the key to us understanding

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:84%
that this illusion that we
live in, this illusion called

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:90%
duality is that.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Inner peace helps us
to step out of duality

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and stop measuring outside
of ourselves what's

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.310 align:middle line:84%
good, bad, right, wrong,
hot, cold, all of it.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to go within
and sit as the observer.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is energy
healing so important?

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, why is being
a brain surgeon so important?

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:20.140 align:middle line:84%
There's so much about the
body that we still don't know,

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:84%
which is just like
mind boggling to me.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:84%
There is so much about
the body that is--

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:84%
how many doctors and nurses
do I work with who call me

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.400 align:middle line:90%
and ask me can you work on this.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
It's in the brain, it's a
lesion they can't get to it.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.772 align:middle line:90%
It's like we have this.

00:24:39.772 --> 00:24:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
ask you for help.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's because sure
we can do an MRI,

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.760 align:middle line:84%
but actually going in
physically and doing the surgery

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.340 align:middle line:84%
they can't always
get at something.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you can?

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I have.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I worked on a guy two
hours before he went in

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.700 align:middle line:84%
for open heart surgery,
and I repaired the valve,

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.708 align:middle line:84%
I put a stent in,
everything that I did--

00:25:02.708 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what do you
mean you put a stent in?

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, it's
an energetic stent.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An energetic stent.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.585 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: It's an
energetic stent.

00:25:07.585 --> 00:25:08.837 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a real stent.

00:25:08.837 --> 00:25:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Not a real.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It's energy-- it's
an energy stent.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.840 align:middle line:90%
And he went in for surgery.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And they opened him up and
the doctor looked and said,

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.600 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing wrong.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:90%
They closed him up.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: His wife called me
and said, "oh my God, there

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.240 align:middle line:90%
was nothing wrong."

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.132 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you know that it
was working prior to the doctor

00:25:26.132 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:90%
saying there's nothing wrong?

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, I got
a call from his wife,

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and she said, "please
work on my husband.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.660 align:middle line:84%
He's going to go into
surgery in two hours."

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your Earth Angel
diary series is wonderful.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.240 align:middle line:90%
Here's another example.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: When I walk in
an ancient stone circle,

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:10%
I feel a tremendous
amount of peace.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm actually feeling
all this energy

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:10%
coming in from the
cosmos and energy

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:10%
from the Earth rising up
through the bottom of my feet.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:10%
It's a magical experience.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:10%
And when we find
our inner peace,

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.250 align:middle line:10%
it opens up a whole new world.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:10.090 align:middle line:10%
Inner peace is like
the cycle of life.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:10%
Everything circular, Earth, the
moon, the sun, your coffee cup,

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.960 align:middle line:10%
trees are circular, and the base
and in the trunk of the tree

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:10%
there's incredible circles
that show the life of the tree.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:10%
We are created in the
womb, which is a circle.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:10%
Everything that we
experience in life

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:10%
is this pattern, this cycle.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:10%
And in this circular
activity, we

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:10%
have at the very center peace.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonja, are you like
a human energy resource?

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
If I touched you,
would I feel something?

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Probably.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you radiate?

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I have people
tell me all the time

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.490 align:middle line:84%
that they feel so much
better just hearing my voice.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah, you can
tell by your personality

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:84%
alone that your
bubbly and energetic

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:90%
and you give off a glow.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:13.015 align:middle line:84%
But if people bump into
you, do they go oh my God.

00:27:13.015 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I
don't know, George.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I try if I bump into someone to
say excuse me and make my way.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's a
energy with what I do

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and the practice that I have
that definitely comes across

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.700 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You give off energy
as opposed to a psychic vampire

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:90%
that sucks energy.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah because I--

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.667 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
ever exhaust you?

00:27:40.667 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Because I'm all
about helping people.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I turned my life over
to being in service

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's more important to me
to be in service to the planet

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.760 align:middle line:90%
and to people than to take.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm not about taking.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It wore
down Edgar Cayce.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah it did.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it wear down you?

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Sure.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:01.660 align:middle line:90%
I get worn down.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.702 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can feel it?

00:28:02.702 --> 00:28:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I have to have
times where I take a break.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
charge yourself?

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I get outside,
I lay down on the planet.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm all about recharging.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that picture
we saw earlier of you

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:90%
in front of that rock.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Were you like getting
something from that?

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, sure.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:84%
That's an amazing
place up in Norway.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It's nine stone circles
that in my opinion

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.480 align:middle line:90%
represent the nine realms.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very magical place.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't always find
magical places.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But even in my
own backyard, I'll

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.480 align:middle line:84%
go outside and
lay on the ground.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hear that
you're a time traveler.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, when
I go into meditation,

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.320 align:middle line:84%
my process is
different than most,

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.100 align:middle line:84%
because my time traveling
is not astral projecting.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:58.090 align:middle line:84%
I literally go into meditation
and my body dissolves

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:90%
like grains of sand.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:03.068 align:middle line:84%
It just floats away, and it's
not until that point that--

00:29:03.068 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you're teleported.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I just dissolve.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And the guides-- my guides
come and take me by the hand

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and they take me where
they want to show me.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't say, "hey, I want
to go see Stonehenge today."

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.480 align:middle line:84%
They take me where they think
I need to see something.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you are
on this kind of journey,

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.380 align:middle line:84%
do you recollect it
when you come back?

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I do, and oftentimes
it's hours and hours later.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:90%
I feel the cold, I feel rain.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The heat.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I have all
the sensations, yes.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And I always think
I'm just going

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:84%
to be gone for 20 minutes,
and it's like three four

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:43.337 align:middle line:84%
or five hours
later and I'm back.

00:29:43.337 --> 00:29:44.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Earth time, Earth time.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
traveled to a place

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.420 align:middle line:90%
that you didn't want to be in?

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I did.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was one time when
I went to the Great Pyramid

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.402 align:middle line:90%
and Anubis was there.

00:29:55.402 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's Anubis?

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Anubis is
the Egyptian God

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that looks like a Dog
with a pointy face.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:07.500 align:middle line:84%
He is the God who handled
death and beyond, one of them.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't scare you?

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It was scary, yes.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:17.340 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of an inquiry of who
were we and why were we there.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.710 align:middle line:90%
So we got out of there fast.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.220 align:middle line:84%
There was another time my
spirit traveled to a place

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.820 align:middle line:84%
where it was after
the fall of Lemuria

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and it was off
the coast of where

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Lemuria used to be in Japan.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And there were these beings
that were alien in nature

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:90%
that were there.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.020 align:middle line:90%
And it was very scary.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at my guides
and I said, "OK, we saw it.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Now we got to go."

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] And we left.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what is your
meditation peace project.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: The meditation
peace project

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is a free one hour meditation
that I do once a month on Zoom.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I have people from all over
the world who come together.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I talk them through my
grounding meditation.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
We go into a deep
state of inner peace

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and we literally
worked on ourselves

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.370 align:middle line:90%
and we work on the planet.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:84%
We're not sending
energy anywhere,

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.380 align:middle line:84%
we're not manipulating
anything anywhere.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
We're simply holding
that vibration.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of the great
people for intention experiments

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:84%
has been Lynne
McTaggart, and she

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.378 align:middle line:84%
was interviewed by Regina
Meredith about meditation.

00:31:29.378 --> 00:31:31.170 align:middle line:10%
>>LYNNE MCTAGGART: We
have this big problem

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.780 align:middle line:10%
on a giant collective level,
and we have this problem

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:10%
on an individual level.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.910 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't supposed to be
like this and in fact,

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:43.890 align:middle line:10%
when we start living according
to the definition of who

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.520 align:middle line:10%
we really are and start
wiping that hard drive

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.887 align:middle line:10%
clean, only then will we evolve
to another level, only then.

00:31:52.887 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: And you say
it's about the last 250 years,

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.270 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Since this paradigm
has really taken

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.965 align:middle line:84%
hold within our psyche,
maybe even less.

00:32:00.965 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:10%
>> MCTAGGART: Yes I mean,
there's always been cases

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.060 align:middle line:10%
of people wanting to be
aggressive or whatever

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.900 align:middle line:10%
or societies where
people were in charge.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.870 align:middle line:10%
But prior to Newton,
we had much more

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:16.920 align:middle line:10%
of a holistic view of ourselves
in relation to the cosmos.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.040 align:middle line:10%
Newton really essentially
ripped us out of that

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:10%
and created a world
of individual things

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:10%
and really defined nothingness.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:10%
And so it became a real
understanding of ours

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:10%
that we end with the hair
on our skin at which point

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.010 align:middle line:10%
the rest of the universe begins.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.220 align:middle line:10%
And that, it's
hard to understand

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.550 align:middle line:10%
how much that
definition of ourselves

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:46.020 align:middle line:10%
really informs how we operate,
because not all cultures.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:50.140 align:middle line:10%
Do many Indigenous cultures
think very differently.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.470 align:middle line:84%
They think of us themselves
as being all connected,

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and from that, they create a
very different kind of society.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.847 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
intention works on you?

00:33:00.847 --> 00:33:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Why does it work?

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.013 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why does it work?

00:33:03.013 --> 00:33:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I think because
we're focusing our energy.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you an example,
if you're watching the news

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.233 align:middle line:84%
and there's something
quite frightening

00:33:11.233 --> 00:33:12.150 align:middle line:90%
that you're watching--

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:13.692 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --which is
most of the time.

00:33:13.692 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: --most of the
time, for most people,

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:84%
their fear comes out from
their body, from their centers

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and connects with the fear
of what they're seeing.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's called
the collective karma.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So we've all just
connected on fear.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And as we have
seen this past two

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:38.640 align:middle line:84%
years of the collective
karma and fear and the virus,

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.690 align:middle line:90%
it's been rampant.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's connected
that fear fiercely

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.650 align:middle line:90%
and been so affected by it.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing clients now
with post-traumatic stress

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
anxiety disorders,

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:84%
because of what
they've gone through.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So my feeling about the
meditation peace project

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
is if we can connect that
strongly with a feeling, fear,

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:84%
we can connect that
strongly with inner peace.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can people take
care of this themselves

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.139 align:middle line:84%
or do they have to go to
someone like Sonja Grace?

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:18.659 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I think that if
I were left to my own devices

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:23.010 align:middle line:84%
to adjust my back and
not go to a chiropractor,

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.290 align:middle line:84%
I might have a bad
back because I need

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.420 align:middle line:90%
the chiropractor to adjust me.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.889 align:middle line:84%
I need my acupuncturist
to put the needles in me.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
put them in myself.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:35.909 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly need
my brain surgeon

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:90%
to do the brain surgery, not me.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So yes, I think that
my role and what I

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:48.570 align:middle line:84%
do for society is important,
because our energy body which

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:84%
is around us called the
aura is so important George

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:55.050 align:middle line:84%
to our physical
health, and being

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.010 align:middle line:84%
able to help people understand
their energy, their chakras,

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:03.240 align:middle line:84%
what's going on with their
inner body, their organs,

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and how everything
functions is important.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.148 align:middle line:84%
It takes the responsibility
back to people.

00:35:11.148 --> 00:35:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonja what
do you do to keep

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.050 align:middle line:90%
yourself upbeat and positive?

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I sing
John Denver songs.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:18.170 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.970 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We sing
"rocky mountain high."

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I love it.

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.960 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm really a
very happy person.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.822 align:middle line:84%
I spend time outside, I go
hiking, I walk miles a day.

00:35:29.822 --> 00:35:31.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever
get down, depressed?

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:90%
You're a human being.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I do, George.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:38.670 align:middle line:84%
I do feel sadness and
sorrow and pain, of course.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
do, are you still

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.710 align:middle line:84%
able to do what you
do with a client?

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:45.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even
though you're down?

00:35:45.925 --> 00:35:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, because I know
how to process those feelings,

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I know how to release
them into the Earth,

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and I know that it's
God's will, not mine.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So I am aligning myself with
creator, with the Earth,

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.950 align:middle line:90%
and I am allowing things to be.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not about being in
control and changing things.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It's about accepting
who we are and being

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.420 align:middle line:84%
in a place of accepting
what our karma is.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:19.290 align:middle line:84%
We all have past lives where
we have had horrific deaths.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.750 align:middle line:84%
We've died in war
together, we've

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.910 align:middle line:90%
experienced famine and disease.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not it's not that
we've all come here

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.730 align:middle line:84%
with some perfect past that
nothing will ever happen to us.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
like your epitaph to read?

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:34.362 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:34.362 --> 00:36:36.320 align:middle line:90%

>>GRACE: She did a
lot and worked hard.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's not selfish
by any means either.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably very
accurate about you.

have the meditation peace

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.722 align:middle line:10%
project on a piece of land
where people can come.

a lot of people, Sonja.

personally from people

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.743 align:middle line:90%
who have come back to us.

00:37:14.743 --> 00:37:15.660 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: You do marvelous work.

intention and create reasons
