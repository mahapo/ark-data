00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.050 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.560 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.854 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.515 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:90%

"Coast to Coast AM" and Gaiam
TV bring you "Beyond Belief"

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.035 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: You know, all
of us at one time in our lives

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
will be confronted with
that horrible word, death.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a friend, a family
member, another loved one,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.430 align:middle line:90%
it's going to happen eventually.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.635 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest tonight
on "Beyond Belief"

00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
is somebody who has
incredible experience,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
not only on this side,
but on the other side.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:90%
He's a medium.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
He talks to the dead,
James Van Praagh.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.952 align:middle line:90%
James, come on in.

00:01:10.952 --> 00:01:11.512 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:12.428 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How are you?

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.412 align:middle line:90%
>> JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Hi, George.

00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:13.904 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:01:13.904 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Have a seat.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.799 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A lot of people are
beginning to realize that you

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:84%
are also the Co-Executive
Producer of that long running

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.205 align:middle line:84%
series, "Ghost Whisperer"
with Jennifer Love Hewitt.

00:01:26.205 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Yes, that's right.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I helped develop that
show and produce the show.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And really brought it
out to the networks.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And now it's changed
everything, as far

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
as ghost busting
and ghost hunting.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And put it out to
the general public.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.666 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: James, what is
the fascination with death,

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.660 align:middle line:90%
with the other side?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.868 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well, I think,
George, that everybody,

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
as human beings, we share
two common experiences.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:90%
And one is birth.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.436 align:middle line:84%
And we've been
through that, so we

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:90%
know a little bit about that.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:90%
But the other is death.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're all going to go
through that experience.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.344 align:middle line:84%
So everybody wants to
know what is that like.

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is there any
way we can bypass that?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:90%
It's part of life.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's going to happen.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And it's a
painless type of experience.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
painful about it.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.165 align:middle line:84%
Leading up to death
may by painful.

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:84%
The type of death you have is a
terminal illness, or something,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:90%
it could be painful.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But when the spirit actually
leaves the physical body,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.935 align:middle line:90%
there is no pain.

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A couple weeks ago, I
was watching old videos of "The

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Rat Pack."

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And there they all were,
Sammy Davis Jr, Frank Sinatra,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Dean Martin, Joey Bishop.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:90%
They were all there.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.221 align:middle line:84%
And it struck me that
they're all gone now.

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:90%
That they were all dead.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.559 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well, I've
brought two of them through.

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And it happens.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.542 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so there's
no escaping this.

00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No, it's
a natural part of life.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:84%
We've done it many,
many, many, many times.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.880 align:middle line:90%
I do believe in reincarnation.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.338 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've
done it thousands

00:02:37.338 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:84%
and thousands and
thousands of times.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Was it here long
before the physical realm?

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.111 align:middle line:84%
Death, you know,
everything dies every day.

00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
We have cells that
die every day.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of life.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And we make it such a big
thing, but it really isn't.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very
natural occurrence.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How did this
all happen for you?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:84%
How did James Van Praagh get
interested in the other side,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.782 align:middle line:90%
and become a medium?

00:02:58.782 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:90%
It kind of picked me, George.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't pick it.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:90%
I really didn't pick it.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:90%
I was very reluctant.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
As a little boy, I used to
see spirits all the time,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:84%
just like in the movie
"The Sixth Sense."

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
my childhood.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And my mother was
also very mediumistic.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And one day I aksed
her, I said, who

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
are those people
at the end of bed?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
those are God's angels.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.805 align:middle line:90%
You see them too?

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:17.840 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So she encouraged it?

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: She did.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.858 align:middle line:84%
Because she had the same
experiences as a young girl,

00:03:21.858 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:90%
herself.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So there was no
negativity, no fear at all.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:90%
And she just said, just open up.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:90%
You're very protected.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:90%
It's God's work, she would say.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:90%
And I've always believed that.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.757 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt such
a great connection,

00:03:33.757 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:84%
as far as when they came
through, when I would see them.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.450 align:middle line:84%
There was this overwhelming
sense of love, of love.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It goes beyond the word love.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:90%
This is energy, this feeling.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it was right.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that that's what
everything was made of.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm sure you've
seen the movie "Ghost"

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:90%
with Whoopi Goldberg, right?

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes, I stood
up and gave a standing ovation

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.926 align:middle line:90%
in the audience.

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does
that happen to you?

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you sit there and have some
entity jump into your body?

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Not quite
as dramatic as that.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:90%
But very similar, very similar.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.790 align:middle line:84%
When I work, I ask the spirit
world, who are right around us,

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
all around us, because
the spirit world really

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
inter-penetrates this dimension,
so they're right here with us.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But as a medium, what I do is,
I ask them to blend with me.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:90%
To come closer to my mind.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And the mind is
part of the soul.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's really mind
to mind communication.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And I invite them in, to
come closer and closer,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:84%
so I start picking up
the personality traits.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And then really start
knowing things about them.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of drop into
my consciousness details

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:90%
about themselves.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What are
they looking for?

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: They want
their loved ones to know that

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.168 align:middle line:90%
they're not dead.

00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:35.816 align:middle line:84%
That there is no
such thing as death.

00:04:35.816 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:84%
That they hear every
thought of theirs.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.720 align:middle line:84%
That their prayers,
their mental thoughts,

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.242 align:middle line:90%
they are very aware of them.

00:04:41.242 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:90%
They're not dead.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
be with them again

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.890 align:middle line:84%
when it's their loved
one's time to pass

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:90%
to the other side of life.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you ever had
someone who passed on and he

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.202 align:middle line:84%
desperately wants to tell his
wife, the money is the wall?

00:04:54.202 --> 00:04:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Do they ever say that?

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I've
had experiences,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
is the 30 years I've
been doing this,

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I have had some experiences
where they would tell where

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
the insurance papers were,
or where the combination

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.141 align:middle line:90%
of the safe was.

00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:06.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I've had, or where
jewelry would be.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:90%
I have had that happen.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: To me, that would
seem very frustrating,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that people will die--
they don't expect to die--

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.174 align:middle line:84%
and they just haven't completed
their business on this side.

00:05:18.174 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That's right.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book called
"Unfinished Business, or What

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:84%
the Dead Teach Us
About Life." and. it's

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.040 align:middle line:84%
so interesting, because
most of the readings, most

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.577 align:middle line:84%
of the messages that come
through are those of regrets.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I should have, would
have, could have.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
If only I knew then
what I know now,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I would have lived my
life so differently.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I would have made
the right choices.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So part of my work
is also to teach

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
people to live the
best life they can.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.694 align:middle line:84%
To demonstrate love
wherever they can.

00:05:41.694 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't want to get to
the other side of life and have

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:90%
regrets.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're not
afraid to dying, are you?

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I
look forward to it.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Though you don't
want to leave too early, night?

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No, I
have to finish my work.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.803 align:middle line:90%
I've got to finish my work here.

00:05:51.803 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But I don't fear
at all, not at all.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, we die every
night we go to sleep.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:84%
When we have dreams,
our spirit body

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:84%
is actually leaving
the physical body

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and goes to the
spirit side of life.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're connected to what's
called the silver cord, which

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
is connecting the solar
plexus to the spirit body.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning, we
come back into the body.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.565 align:middle line:84%
And many people
talk about having

00:06:10.565 --> 00:06:12.320 align:middle line:84%
dreams that are
more than dreams.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:84%
They're visitations
with their loved ones.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:90%
I've seen them.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:90%
They're so real.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.184 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be there with them.

00:06:17.184 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, it's
because you are there

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:90%
with them, in that dimension.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What is it about the
dream state that allows that

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.315 align:middle line:84%
entity, that spirit to
communicate with the person?

00:06:26.315 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I think that
we, as physical beings,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.405 align:middle line:90%
are much more open.

00:06:29.405 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
We're not in the
rational mindset.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:84%
We're not in the critical
mind that really just breaks

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:84%
everything down and
blocks everything.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
We're much more open, because
it's spirit to spirit contact,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.984 align:middle line:90%
So we're much more open.

00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Now it happens to
us all the time,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
but we cannot always remember
the experience in the conscious

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.170 align:middle line:90%
mind when we wake up.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:84%
But when we do, it's a very
real experience for people.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.694 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many people
are afraid of dying?

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You know, George,
not as many as there used

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.810 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.476 align:middle line:84%
So when I first started
doing this work,

00:06:56.476 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
about 30 years ago,
I was the weirdo.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I was on the outside.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's through the many,
many years, as you know this,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.040 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness has
definitely changed.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:90%
People had experiences.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.426 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can talk about
their kind of experiences,

00:07:07.426 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
whether it's deja vu, whether
it's a dream of a loved one

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.915 align:middle line:84%
that passed over, or
they're aware of someone

00:07:11.915 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
that passed over
standing next to them.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:90%
We've all had those experiences.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think deep down, in
the core of their soul,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:84%
they recognize those
experiences as truth.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think many more
people are much more

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.132 align:middle line:90%
accepting of this now.

00:07:23.132 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And they are because
of television shows,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of course, now,
movies, and books.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Much more relatively
aware of these things now.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: A neurosurgeon
came down with meningitis.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:90%
And he was in a coma.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And in this coma
state, he truly felt

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:90%
that he had seen the other side.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:90%
That he died.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I've
read that book, yeah.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, Eben Alexander.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.820 align:middle line:90%
And he came back.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And he is now convinced
that the other side exists.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:90%
Now this is a scientist.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:90%
This is a medical doctor.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.706 align:middle line:84%
And he was so opposed to
it before this happened.

00:07:55.706 --> 00:07:57.580 align:middle line:84%
It does change your
life, it's life-altering.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Isn't that a
great example of somebody--

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're going to
pick somebody to have that

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.260 align:middle line:90%
experience--

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.134 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: There he is

00:08:02.134 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: --what better
than a skeptical doctor who

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.930 align:middle line:84%
works in this field,
and had the experience?

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think, one of the people
that he saw on the other side

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.286 align:middle line:90%
was a guide of his, a woman.

00:08:11.286 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:90%
And she was very beautiful.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know who she was
until he got back on the Earth.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.335 align:middle line:90%
And he was adopted.

00:08:16.335 --> 00:08:17.184 align:middle line:90%
You know the story.

00:08:17.184 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, it ended up that
that was a sister of his,

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
a natural sister
that died very young.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's incredible.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.995 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And they
showed him a photograph.

00:08:22.995 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:84%
It was exactly the
spirit that he had seen.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:25.955 align:middle line:90%
Amazing story.

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: James, a few years
ago, I had a friend of mine,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:84%
he died in a
motorcycle accident.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:90%
And it was a horrible situation.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:90%
He was speeding.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:84%
A car driven by a very
elderly person pulled out

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:84%
in front of him, and he t-boned
her, and he went flying.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Landed on a stop sign, his
body, and it almost severed him,

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:90%
but he died.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
At the funeral, which
I don't particularly

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:84%
enjoy going to,
but at the funeral

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at his body,
how empty, how cold it was.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And for one split
second, it hit me

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:90%
that what if it doesn't exist?

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:84%
What if the other
side is not there?

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.820 align:middle line:90%
That this is it, it's all over?

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell
you, it was probably

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.420 align:middle line:84%
one of the loneliest feelings
I have ever had, ever.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that religion
created the other side

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:84%
so that we live this
life thinking, OK, it

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.387 align:middle line:90%
exists on the other side?

00:09:33.387 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Now you would say
otherwise, I'm sure,

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:84%
because of your experience, and
your communication with those.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But I've always
thought, well, maybe

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.392 align:middle line:84%
they created that-- when
I had my moment of doubt.

00:09:44.392 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You
know, who knows?

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.141 align:middle line:84%
Religions, I mean, I have a
whole thing about religion,

00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:84%
because, of course,
religion, are man-made.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.300 align:middle line:90%
And I was raised Catholic.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I just think that every
religion has bits of the truth,

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.700 align:middle line:84%
but not one religion
has all the truth.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.324 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you have to
have religion for some people

00:10:01.324 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:84%
to feel there's a
sense of organization,

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:84%
or that they belong
to something.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
But also we have to
remember that there

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:84%
are many religions who really
work from fear, fear-based.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.817 align:middle line:84%
And it's through fear they
can control the masses.

00:10:11.817 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they were
to give everybody

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:84%
the secrets, if you will,
the knowledge that there

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.060 align:middle line:84%
is no death, there is
another side of life,

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.143 align:middle line:84%
and it's just how you treat
another person, that's

00:10:20.143 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:90%
all you have to do.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But there are some religions
that are very rigid

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and they have to hold people
into that organization

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:90%
in order to be this religion.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
The religion that I follow,
because many people ask me,

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:90%
is the religion of love.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.075 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:10:33.075 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a universal energy
that we all have.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
religions, per se,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:84%
as, you can only
see God this way.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.570 align:middle line:84%
God is a man with a white
beard and lives in a cloud.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:90%
It's just so mythological to me.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:90%
That just doesn't work for me.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:90%
It's so old fashioned.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:90%
We all, I believe, are all god.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I believe we all have
that god spark within us.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And I believe our life,
here on this earth,

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.710 align:middle line:90%
is how to express that god.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And how to share that god.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And how to bring up
the consciousness,

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
the awareness of
god in everybody.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I have a
simple formula of life.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.517 align:middle line:84%
Live for today,
die for tomorrow.

00:11:05.517 --> 00:11:06.600 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I think
that's a perfect one, George.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.291 align:middle line:84%
And that goes along
with what I have,

00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:13.799 align:middle line:84%
which is, a successful
life is when you pass away

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and you look back at
your life on the earth

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.112 align:middle line:84%
and you've changed someone's
life, made it successful.

00:11:18.112 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
That's a successful life,
when you've changed people,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
you've brought up the
consciousness, if you will.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And of course,
we're interactive,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:90%
here on "Beyond Belief."

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Which means, those of
you in the audience,

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
we will take your questions
for James Van Praagh.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So just put your hands up
and we'll get right to you.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Sure, let's have one from you.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I would like
to know, OK, so people die.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:90%
They go to the other side.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So if I have a loved one
that went to the other side,

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and I went to a reading with
you, and he didn't show up.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Could he possibly have
been reincarnated?

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And would that be like
why he wouldn't show up?

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.394 align:middle line:90%
Or do you know that?

00:11:55.394 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, where
do they go, James?

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's
a good question.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.296 align:middle line:84%
And many people
ask that question,

00:11:59.296 --> 00:12:00.735 align:middle line:90%
because it's a common question.

00:12:00.735 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Because people
want to know that.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And I often say,
well, don't think

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
of the soul as just
this linear being

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that this is just encased
in our physical body.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
The soul is much,
much more than that.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So I say, think of
the soul as the sun.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And that this one physical
body is a ray of that sun.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But we're much, much
bigger and more than that.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:84%
This is just one
part of our soul.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So the personality that you
would know from the earth world

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.570 align:middle line:90%
it's just one part of that soul.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be with
you when you pass over,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.682 align:middle line:84%
because we tend to come
back and group souls.

00:12:32.682 --> 00:12:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's come back, and not only
learn individually as groups,

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
but as those group
souls we evolve too.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:37.750 align:middle line:90%
So there's a connection.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.458 align:middle line:84%
There's a karmic
connection, if you will.

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:40.682 align:middle line:90%
So we do it together.

00:12:40.682 --> 00:12:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So you'll always
meet up with those

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
loved ones who we've known
here, at the personality.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Life is the time here,
whether it's 60, 70, 80, 90

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
years that we live here
and then pass over.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It's very small time in
the scheme of things.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.090 align:middle line:84%
In the scheme of the soul,
it's very small, right?

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.409 align:middle line:90%
It's the blink of an eye.

00:12:58.409 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What percent of
the people that you are with,

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen you at events, and
I mean they come out in droves,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
what percent can you not reach
that other person on the other

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.492 align:middle line:84%
side, because maybe they
have gone somewhere?

00:13:11.492 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well, there
are many factors involved.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the person
that's receiving the reading,

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:90%
maybe they're closed down.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they're sitting
there and they're

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.874 align:middle line:84%
very obsessed about hearing
one particular thing,

00:13:20.874 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:90%
like a nickname.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:90%
So they close things down.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Or they want to hear
from their dead father,

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.185 align:middle line:84%
but for some reason that father
might not want to communicate.

00:13:28.185 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Just because we want
to hear from them,

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.684 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that they're
willing to do this.

00:13:31.684 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
But a neighbor
might come through,

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.020 align:middle line:84%
the animal, family dog
might come through.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So you never know
what's going to happen.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.321 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Taking more of your
questions for James Van Praagh,

00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:90%
in the audience.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Just show your hands and
we'll get right to you.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: You had mentioned
something about not looking

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:90%
back towards the past?

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of had a rough
life the past seven years.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to still deal with
it, emotionally and mentally.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I don't
know how to deal

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
with it with the loss
of my mom and my brother

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.085 align:middle line:90%
and going through a divorce.

00:14:06.085 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And I have a lot of regrets.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So I would
say to you, number one,

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.810 align:middle line:84%
that you're a soul having
a physical experience.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Not the other way around.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So we have to realize
from a perspective

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that we, being
soul beings, we'll

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.720 align:middle line:84%
come back to this Earth
as our school room.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And we go through
many, many lessons.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the hardest lessons
in life are grief, loss.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.344 align:middle line:90%
Loss of love, as well.

00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Guilt.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:30.884 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Guilt.

00:14:30.884 --> 00:14:31.832 align:middle line:90%
Guilt.

00:14:31.832 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:84%
I should have, would
have, could have's, right.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So I often tell people, live
for right in this moment now.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.200 align:middle line:90%
The past has happened.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
It's already happened,
you can't change the past.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And you really can look
forward to the future,

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:84%
but you have to live
for this moment now.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And I often say,
assess your life.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:84%
What has that taught
you from the past?

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:90%
What lessons did it teach you?

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.980 align:middle line:84%
What gifts did the dead
go and leave you behind?

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:90%
There's some wonderful gifts.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to have the
courage to open up those gifts

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.720 align:middle line:90%
and see what they taught us.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.420 align:middle line:90%
How are our lives better?

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And we can go on, because
we picked this, as souls.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And we're never alone.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.232 align:middle line:90%
We're never alone.

00:15:10.232 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:90%
They're always with us.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I often say, they
share life with us.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:84%
They're right around
us, encouraging us,

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.080 align:middle line:84%
influencing us to
do certain things.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:84%
They're helping us
as much as they can.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.340 align:middle line:84%
From this physical point
of view, we can't see them.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a limitation,
if you will.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:90%
But they are so, so around you.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:90%
And they're guiding you.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:90%
They're always guiding us.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you also beat
yourself up too much, maybe,

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:90%
like she is?

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you, you
know, a year and a half

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.636 align:middle line:84%
ago, James, as you
know, my father died.

00:15:35.636 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I
spoke to you, I think,

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
two days on the
radio afterwards.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.838 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:84%
He was in Detroit, I
was in Los Angeles.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get there in time.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:90%
For a long time, it bothered me.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I felt like, I should
have been there.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But I really believe he was at
peace, and he remembered me.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.867 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped beating
myself up over that.

00:15:55.867 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.199 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:57.199 --> 00:16:00.264 align:middle line:84%
Because, George, a common
experience for people

00:16:00.264 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
is that they're not there
when their loved one goes.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.013 align:middle line:84%
And they do beat
themselves up saying,

00:16:04.013 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:90%
I should have been there.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:90%
I should have been there.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.398 align:middle line:84%
Well, what difference
would it have made?

00:16:07.398 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
the spirit is going

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:90%
to go when they're going to go.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that there's a
time to come into the earth,

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:90%
and a time to leave.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, most souls

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:90%
prefer to leave on their own.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.959 align:middle line:90%
It happened to my mom.

00:16:17.959 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:84%
My father was coming
up the elevator,

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:84%
my sister was going down the
elevator in the hospital.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.745 align:middle line:90%
My mother died right in between.

00:16:22.745 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, jeez.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: We tend to come
into this world by ourselves--

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.891 align:middle line:84%
through the birth
canal by ourselves.

00:16:26.891 --> 00:16:28.297 align:middle line:90%
And we want to go out alone.

00:16:28.297 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yep.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: The spirit people
are always around greeting us.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.879 align:middle line:90%
No one ever dies alone.

00:16:31.879 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Because your spirit family
is there greeting you,

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.814 align:middle line:84%
helping you over to
the other side of life.

00:16:35.814 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Its weird to say the
other side of life.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Helping you through to the
other dimension, if you will.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Again, which is a very
natural, painless experience.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So the best thing we could
do for our loved ones

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:90%
is say, I love you.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, very much.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:90%
I honor you.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And honor them by
giving them love.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.772 align:middle line:84%
And don't beat
yourself up so much,

00:16:51.772 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:90%
because they pick up on that.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:84%
They read all of
your mental thoughts.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.171 align:middle line:84%
And they love you
so much, they don't

00:16:56.171 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%
want you to beat yourself up.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:90%
They don't want that.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's good.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.226 align:middle line:90%
Make you feel a little better?

00:17:01.226 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:90%
A little bit?

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:02.775 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: A little bit.

00:17:02.775 --> 00:17:04.858 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I love
the memory book you made

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:90%
for your family.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
The little memory book
you made for them,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.199 align:middle line:90%
a scrapbook, or some kind of--

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: My sister did.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Your sister did.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.888 align:middle line:90%
And I love that you did that.

00:17:11.888 --> 00:17:13.680 align:middle line:84%
They loved it that
you did that, OK.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Pass that on, would you?

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I will, thank you.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: The other side, do we
ever run out of souls that get

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:21.550 align:middle line:90%
recreated?

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: People
often ask that, George.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Do we run out of souls?

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, no we
don't run out of souls.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to remember
that there are many,

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:84%
many galaxies, solar
systems, planets--

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:84%
millions and millions
and millions.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.200 align:middle line:90%
So this is just one place.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.606 align:middle line:84%
The Milky Way is one
place of millions.

00:17:36.606 --> 00:17:39.259 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are we all sharing
the souls and everything?

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is only
one form of life.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.245 align:middle line:84%
There are many
different forms of life,

00:17:43.245 --> 00:17:45.120 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
vaporous, gas, liquid.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And we can go to different
planets, if you will,

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:48.295 align:middle line:90%
and different star systems.

00:17:48.295 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And experience life
in different ways.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.045 align:middle line:84%
So as a soul, again,
we're not limited

00:17:52.045 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:90%
to just this physical body.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
We are much, much
more than that.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.538 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It is amazing
what's out there.

00:17:56.538 --> 00:17:58.259 align:middle line:90%
And how it was all put together.

00:17:58.259 --> 00:17:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That's the genius
of all of this thing, James.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's amazing.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:84%
There's an
intelligence beyond us

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
that really does
hold it all together.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe there is a
rhythm and a rhyme to life.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.169 align:middle line:90%
I really, really do.

00:18:10.169 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Even when we-- and I'm just
writing a book about this--

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:84%
even though things seem,
like when there's a death

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's devastating, and
shocking things happen,

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:84%
or horrible things happen on
this earth, believe it or not,

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I think if we could see
outside that perspective,

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.789 align:middle line:84%
if we could go
outside of that, we

00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:84%
would see that there's
definitely something

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.135 align:middle line:90%
in charge, something in order.

00:18:29.135 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And that really, we're just
the puppets, the marionettes,

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.099 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:34.140 align:middle line:84%
But there are the masters
there, working with us.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:90%
I do believe that.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We will be back in
just a moment. "Beyond Belief"

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.788 align:middle line:84%
James Van Praagh
our special guest.

00:18:40.788 --> 00:18:42.732 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:42.732 --> 00:18:47.076 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.076 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief"

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:84%
with the medium,
James Van Praagh.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
You are one of the
best I've interviewed

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:90%
on "Coast to Coast."

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:90%
I love being on your show.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You generate
so much response.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And the passion that
you have for what you do

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and for the people you talk to,
is, obviously, quite evident.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:84%
You get recognized now,
too, wherever you go.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.659 align:middle line:84%
What do people want to know
when they come up to you?

00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:17.283 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: They want to know
if their loved ones are alive,

00:19:17.283 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.475 align:middle line:84%
And that's the overall
question they ask me.

00:19:21.475 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:90%
I say, yes, they are.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
number one question.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.769 align:middle line:84%
And then the lottery
numbers, which I don't do.

00:19:26.769 --> 00:19:28.351 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You don't
give them, do you?

00:19:28.351 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Write them
down for me, would you?

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: We'll talk later.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.058 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:19:33.058 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are
some people who do that.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: People
ask me, they'll say,

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.380 align:middle line:90%
can read lottery numbers.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.046 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, if I
had this gift you do,

00:19:39.046 --> 00:19:40.239 align:middle line:90%
I would get the lottery.

00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And I say, really, the
work isn't for that.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.770 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I do.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what I'm
made for, if you will.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:90%
And so, I can't do that.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I have very good
intuition, of course.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Because every medium
has very good intuition.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But I believe, George,
like in everything in life,

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.186 align:middle line:84%
you have use things
for the right reason

00:19:55.186 --> 00:19:56.890 align:middle line:90%
and the motivation, the intent.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What drives you?

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Love.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:19:59.790 align:middle line:90%
Love.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Opening up hearts
and minds of people.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.886 align:middle line:84%
And letting them see
who they truly are.

00:20:04.886 --> 00:20:06.260 align:middle line:84%
The hardest part
of my job is not

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.670 align:middle line:84%
talking to dead
people, that's OK.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.600 align:middle line:84%
The hardest part is when
I work with somebody

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and I see their
beautiful gifts, and they

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:90%
don't see them for themselves.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.884 align:middle line:90%
And that's a shame.

00:20:14.884 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
don't see those gifts

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.299 align:middle line:84%
until they pass to the
other side of life,

00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:19.969 align:middle line:84%
and they see who
they really are.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So I really want to
let them see themselves

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.700 align:middle line:84%
while they're living
on this earth.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, the one
thing I've noticed about life

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.097 align:middle line:90%
is that it goes by way too fast.

00:20:27.097 --> 00:20:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So quickly.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean when I was 20,
and I was thinking about what

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.660 align:middle line:84%
was life going to be
like when you're 40.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I went, naw, that's
too far away.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Don't even think about that.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.577 align:middle line:90%
It has gone by like that.

00:20:40.577 --> 00:20:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Quickly, quickly.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And so you have
to enjoy it while you can.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And then when you jump
over to the other side,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.189 align:middle line:90%
enjoy that, too.

00:20:49.189 --> 00:20:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I think
the secret of life--

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.188 align:middle line:84%
here I am the great guru
telling the secret of life--

00:20:53.188 --> 00:20:56.280 align:middle line:84%
but I think one of the secrets
of life is really taking those

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.420 align:middle line:84%
moments and living the best
for each moment you can.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And even when you meet
people, live that moment,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
treat them the best
you possibly can.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Find the best in them
and acknowledge that.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you can make the
most of the moments,

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I think when the end of
those moments of life

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
go by, you can look back say,
wow, I lived the best I could

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:90%
with those moments I had.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you die, is it
sort of like the dream state,

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
in that, in your dream, you
actually believe these things

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:90%
are really happening.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you feel it, you sense
it, you get scared by it,

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:90%
you laugh with it.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Is that sort of what
the other side is like?

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.694 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it like a
continuous dream state?

00:21:36.694 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: But
it's more real.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So when we leave the body, we go
to the other side, if you will.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:84%
We step into another
level of consciousness.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just stepping
into the lighter being,

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:90%
the light part of ourselves.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.620 align:middle line:84%
We are more, we are this
physical body, but then more

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.624 align:middle line:90%
some, if you will.

00:21:50.624 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to look back
at the physical body,

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.507 align:middle line:90%
the physical earth.

00:21:53.507 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And everybody goes to their own
funerals and memorial services

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and they look back
and see things.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And they feel like,
wow, that body,

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:90%
that's like, not even who I am.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to call
it the dream state,

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:90%
yes, it's very, very real.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
10 times, 20 times,
30 times stronger

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.714 align:middle line:90%
than the physical experience.

00:22:08.714 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, we just see
a little bit of it

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:90%
here in this physical body.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But when you step
onto the other side,

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
there's an opening of
awareness, of consciousness.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:84%
There's more of a
roundness, like, wow.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I describe it as
taking your sunglasses off

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.031 align:middle line:84%
and be able to see
for the first time.

00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I had a call on "Coast
to Coast" one night, James,

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:84%
from a woman who was an
emergency medical technician,

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:32.100 align:middle line:84%
who happened to come across
an accident when she was not

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And no one else was out there.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:39.630 align:middle line:84%
She gets there and sees this
guy on the side of road.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.995 align:middle line:84%
And his car crashed
and nobody else around.

00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And so she jumps out
of her car and she's

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:90%
attending to this person.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:84%
She hasn't been able to
reach for her phone yet.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
But she looks across
the road and sees

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
a guy standing
there watching her.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And she yells over to him
and says, please help me.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Call 911.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:06.147 align:middle line:84%
She goes back to look at the
body, and it was that guy.

00:23:06.147 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: His spirit.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So he had died,
and he was on the other side.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.454 align:middle line:84%
But why was he there
standing there watching?

00:23:13.454 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh, because--

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Was he in shock?

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No, many times
when you're in an accident like

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.850 align:middle line:84%
that, you pop out of the body
and you observe what's going

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:20.400 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Someone could be, am I--
is that me down there?

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Has this has happened to me?

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.070 align:middle line:84%
There is a state of,
maybe, sometimes confusion.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.139 align:middle line:84%
Because that's me
but yet I'm here.

00:23:30.139 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Just like in the movie "Ghost."

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.099 align:middle line:84%
When Patrick Swayze
was killed, he

00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:34.640 align:middle line:84%
was standing up,
looking at his body.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And he, for a couple of seconds,
he was kind of in shock.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: He's in shock.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.075 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Is
this happening?

00:23:39.075 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's a different
awareness, if you will.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's really an
adjustment period.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So that was right
after he left the body

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:90%
and he was looking down.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.820 align:middle line:90%
We all do that.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you hear these
stories, time and time again.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Police officers have
called the show.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:84%
The one guy said,
George, you're not

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.486 align:middle line:90%
going to believe this story.

00:23:53.486 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well try me.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about
how he and his partner

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
had been called to go to a
house of a heart attack victim.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:90%
And they get to the door.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
They knock on it, an
old man opens it up.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:84%
They see a person on his
face dying on the floor.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.550 align:middle line:90%
They roll him over.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.416 align:middle line:90%
Its the guy who opened the door.

00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:16.290 align:middle line:90%
How does this happen?

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I hear
a lot of those stories.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.885 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's his
spirit, obviously.

00:24:19.885 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
he opened the door.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:21.785 align:middle line:90%
There's pretty good energy.

00:24:21.785 --> 00:24:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That is energy.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
That's a very good,

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.450 align:middle line:90%
strong energy that man has.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Still physical energy would
be still remnant there.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.060 align:middle line:84%
But that does
happen all the time.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.780 align:middle line:90%
We leave our bodies, right away.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.176 align:middle line:90%
We pop out of the body.

00:24:32.176 --> 00:24:33.300 align:middle line:90%
And there's no pain, again.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's very
important to know.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell me about
the reincarnation.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.935 align:middle line:90%
Does everybody reincarnate?

00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why can't we just
stay on the other side?

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.306 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: We can.

00:24:42.306 --> 00:24:43.204 align:middle line:90%
We have that choice.

00:24:43.204 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And again, there are many,
many places come back to.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is just one place.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:84%
But many of us had
to reincarnate.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And many of us do tend
to come this Earth level.

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.520 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is probably one
of the most unevolved places

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.144 align:middle line:90%
around-- sorry to say.

00:24:55.144 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of on the
lower rung of the ladder,

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:90%
because we still kill people.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:84%
We still don't
understand what love is.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.155 align:middle line:90%
You know, we go to war.

00:25:02.155 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:90%
That's nothing.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no death,
so why are you doing that?

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're really the
young ones, if you will.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:10.490 align:middle line:90%
The nursery school ones.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.145 align:middle line:84%
And there tend to be people that
come back to-- light workers,

00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:84%
if you will-- to help change
the conscientiousness.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.954 align:middle line:84%
To bring up the awareness and
the knowledge, the wisdom.

00:25:17.954 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
But this is a place,
here, where there's

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:90%
a lot of free choice, free will.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:24.299 align:middle line:84%
And you really have to rely
on your strength of your soul.

00:25:24.299 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Experiences of your soul.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.220 align:middle line:84%
You've had lifetimes
after lifetimes.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.736 align:middle line:84%
And I often say,
it's like a play.

00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like a play, just
like Shakespeare said.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're merely
players upon the stage.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.989 align:middle line:84%
And we come back to learn,
this our school room.

00:25:35.989 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So many times we'll come back
with same family, the same soul

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And one lifetime you
might be the child,

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.280 align:middle line:90%
and now you're the mother.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And we switch up
roles all the time,

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:84%
because we need to learn what
it's like to be the mother,

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to be the child, to go
through this situation.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I work a lot with parents
that lose children.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And I say to some of
them, in another lifetime,

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:84%
you left early and
they had to learn

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:90%
what it was like to lose you.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Now in this lifetime,
it's turned around.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:84%
We've gotta learn both sides
of the coin, if you will.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.677 align:middle line:90%
The wholeness of the experience.

00:26:03.677 --> 00:26:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's exciting.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.551 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've always
wondered, by the way,

00:26:06.551 --> 00:26:08.520 align:middle line:84%
when I would watch
television talk shows, what

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:84%
are in these cups
that they give people?

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: There's water.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.941 align:middle line:90%
There is water.

00:26:12.941 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm not
sure mine's water.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh a
little vodka, maybe.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:16.983 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: No, I'm kidding.

00:26:16.983 --> 00:26:19.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:84%
The other side, the side where
people will reincarnate or not,

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
some people will come
back with a birthmark that

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:84%
is identical to the birth
mark of the other person who

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.085 align:middle line:90%
is living.

00:26:34.085 --> 00:26:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That's right.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How does that happen?

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Or very
much where they'll have

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.867 align:middle line:84%
the birthmark and they
find out in a past life,

00:26:38.867 --> 00:26:40.950 align:middle line:84%
because of a past life
regression they might have,

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that when they become regressed
they realize that , oh,

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.440 align:middle line:90%
I was shot there.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
shot, was right here.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.125 align:middle line:84%
And in this lifetime, they come
back and they have a mark here.

00:26:49.125 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's very, very common.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's just really,
it's part of their soul.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It's part of that
experience they had.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I also believe that--
this is my own theory--

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.730 align:middle line:84%
that, let's say, you
died in a past life

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.260 align:middle line:84%
when you were 32 years
old, by a hanging.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.830 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling--
this is just a theory--

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.015 align:middle line:84%
that in this time,
lifetime, when you reach 32,

00:27:08.015 --> 00:27:10.260 align:middle line:84%
you might have a
throat condition.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.455 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a soul
memory of the experience.

00:27:12.455 --> 00:27:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good point.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And
I do believe that.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we
do share lifetimes

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.174 align:middle line:84%
with other people we've had had
past lives with, all the time.

00:27:19.174 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And I often say, the
people in your life

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:84%
right now, that you have the
hardest times with, probably

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.290 align:middle line:84%
family, or people you work
with, they are your greatest

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:90%
teachers.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Because what inside
them are you learning?

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.351 align:middle line:84%
Are you learning patience,
forgiveness, what is it?

00:27:33.351 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that
we're all connected.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe-- I think the
two biggest illusions that we

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:84%
have in this three dimensional
world, number one is death.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And the other is a
sense of separativeness.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.490 align:middle line:84%
That we're separate
from one another.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:84%
When in reality, in my work, I
found that we're all connected.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.026 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest illusion
here, in this world,

00:27:51.026 --> 00:27:53.650 align:middle line:84%
this physical dimension, is that
we're cut off from each other.

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:56.120 align:middle line:84%
But really, when we pass
into this spiritual world

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:84%
we realize, oh my gosh,
we're all connected.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
We're all one
being, if you will.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We will be
back in just a moment.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.154 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond Belief," James Van
Praagh our special guest.

00:28:05.154 --> 00:28:08.106 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:08.106 --> 00:28:12.110 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome back to
"Beyond Belief" with medium,

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.190 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh with us.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:84%
James, wonderful opportunity to
have this discussion with you

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.145 align:middle line:90%
about life and death.

00:28:22.145 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Thank you, George.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, for
inviting me to be here.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What does it
mean when people say,

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.750 align:middle line:90%
that's my soul mate?

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Yet in some cases,
they get divorced.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.795 align:middle line:90%
What happened to the soul mate?

00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well, they've
obviously come back to learn

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.920 align:middle line:84%
People have this idea that
when you say soul mate

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:90%
there's only one.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And I don't necessarily
believe that.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Because as a soul
mate, or soul mates,

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe what that
means is really

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that this soul has had
many, many lifetimes

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
with that other
soul or other souls.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So you, think of
it this way, you

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:84%
might think, let's
take a class together.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And you've shared
many, many classes,

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.870 align:middle line:84%
or many, many lifetimes,
many lifetime experiences.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So these souls tend to have
an affinity with each other

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.630 align:middle line:90%
and becomes soul mates.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.172 align:middle line:84%
You've shared many,
many experiences.

00:29:07.172 --> 00:29:09.671 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you meet somebody
for the first time and say,

00:29:09.671 --> 00:29:10.187 align:middle line:90%
I know you.

00:29:10.187 --> 00:29:11.020 align:middle line:90%
There's a closeness.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.017 align:middle line:90%
There's a familiarity there.

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's a
soul mate, as well.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So I think there are
many, many soul mates.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there might be one person
that you have an interest,

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.959 align:middle line:84%
a loving interest with, or
a really strong connection.

00:29:22.959 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe
that's just someone

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.830 align:middle line:84%
you've had many,
many, many lifetimes

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.580 align:middle line:90%
and you're working out "karma."

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.549 align:middle line:84%
Now karma is a love
cause and effect.

00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:32.340 align:middle line:84%
What you've given out,
you have experience.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:84%
What you give out, you
create all the time.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
experience what you create,

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:90%
good, bad, or indifferent.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe karma
is a punishment.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.440 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
a way of learning.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Before the break, you
were talking about a hanging,

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:90%
a suicide.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Most religions will
say, if one commits suicide,

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:53.349 align:middle line:84%
they're banned to
hell for all eternity.

00:29:53.349 --> 00:29:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Ooh.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've
never believed that.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I think a person
who commits suicide is very

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:90%
troubled, very depressed.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:84%
They sometimes don't
realize that eventually life

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:84%
is going to be greener
on the other side,

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.984 align:middle line:90%
so just wait it out.

00:30:06.984 --> 00:30:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That's right.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.915 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What happens
to that individual?

00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's
very funny, George,

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.990 align:middle line:84%
because the questions
you're asking me are ones

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.170 align:middle line:84%
of, I'm literally in the
hotel writing this morning,

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:16.794 align:middle line:84%
and these are things
I'm writing about.

00:30:16.794 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:90%
So pretty strange.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Suicide is very interesting.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.314 align:middle line:84%
And very interesting
because people

00:30:24.314 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:84%
tend to think that, because
of the religious connotations.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're condemned to hell.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.196 align:middle line:90%
Not true.

00:30:30.196 --> 00:30:31.220 align:middle line:90%
No soul is ever harmed.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:90%
You cannot harm a soul.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.579 align:middle line:84%
There's only love, pure love
from the other side of life.

00:30:35.579 --> 00:30:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying
to help that soul.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's a
condition of the mind.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that spirit,
that person on the Earth,

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.410 align:middle line:84%
is going through various
life experiences,

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:46.280 align:middle line:84%
life situations, that are very
difficult for them to handle,

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.266 align:middle line:90%
these challenges.

00:30:47.266 --> 00:30:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
how to handle them.

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's all different
reasons for suicide.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.395 align:middle line:84%
There's always, I would say,
the motivation behind the act,

00:30:54.395 --> 00:30:55.725 align:middle line:90%
or the intent behind the act.

00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So somebody decides
to take their life,

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.770 align:middle line:84%
to leave school early--
you know, none of us

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.680 align:middle line:84%
should cut school early,
it's not a good thing--

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.490 align:middle line:84%
but there might be
somebody who has

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:06.929 align:middle line:84%
a chemical imbalance
in the brain.

00:31:06.929 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And they leave.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:09.900 align:middle line:90%
They complete suicide.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.230 align:middle line:84%
That's very, very different
than somebody whose Google

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.510 align:middle line:84%
stock went down and they
jump out of a window.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.900 align:middle line:90%
So the intent is different.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.270 align:middle line:90%
The motivation is different.

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.728 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be
received differently

00:31:18.728 --> 00:31:19.940 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of life.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.490 align:middle line:84%
If there's a soul
that's tortured,

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.440 align:middle line:84%
if you will, or there's
a chemical imbalance

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.020 align:middle line:84%
of some kind, we're
met by those loved ones

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.820 align:middle line:84%
in the spirit world
who help to clean up

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.440 align:middle line:90%
the conditions of the mind.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Suicide is learning.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:90%
It's learning.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Years ago I thought about this.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Before we come back
to this incarnation,

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:84%
we always set up, if you will,
I call it destiny points.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:84%
We map out our lives
before we come back.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that maybe there
could be one lifetime where

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.670 align:middle line:84%
this soul group has
come together and said,

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, you're going
to complete suicide

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:84%
so we can all learn
about different lessons

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.721 align:middle line:84%
about what that's like
when someone in our family

00:31:54.721 --> 00:31:55.990 align:middle line:90%
commits suicide.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's a possibility.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.602 align:middle line:90%
Why couldn't it be?

00:31:58.602 --> 00:32:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So I just believe it's the
motivation behind the act.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.500 align:middle line:90%
But no soul is ever harmed.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.670 align:middle line:90%
There is no hell.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:90%
There's is nothing like that.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you are
doing your readings,

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:12.390 align:middle line:84%
have you ever been
confronted by a demon,

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:17.040 align:middle line:84%
some kind of an entity that
is not supposed to be there?

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.250 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.083 align:middle line:84%
I'm more afraid of the
living than the dead.

00:32:20.083 --> 00:32:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I actually am.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.285 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You really are.

00:32:21.285 --> 00:32:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I've worked
in Hollywood for a long time.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I've seen demons living
and I've seen some, mm.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:27.680 align:middle line:90%
I've seen energy around people.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I've seen negative energy,
I've seen positive energy.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And I see fear-based energy
can be very negative.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And the more someone
lives in fear,

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.560 align:middle line:84%
they tend to attract to them
like a magnet, more fear

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.150 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And it builds up and
builds up and builds up.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I do believe there are
many, many levels of spirit.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are
many evolved beings.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.580 align:middle line:90%
And unevolved beings.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe in
demons, because that's

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:90%
kind of a religious connotation.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I do believe there might be
energies or entities that

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.140 align:middle line:84%
are very unevolved who are
trying to get around us.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.200 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
every single person

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.900 align:middle line:90%
is made of this pure god light.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that love
really conquers anything.

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So the more love we have within
our hearts and in our minds,

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:14.690 align:middle line:84%
we tend to push anything of the
lower levels away, if you will.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:90%
So I've never had that.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I've had more people in
the audiences of mine

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.190 align:middle line:84%
be more negative
than the spirit.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When you
walk into a room,

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
can you tell if somebody's
one of those so-called psychic

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.240 align:middle line:90%
vampires?

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Those energy zappers?

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.755 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Immediately.

00:33:28.755 --> 00:33:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, because I
feel energy, I see energy.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And immediately when I walk into
a room, I can tell, like that.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do you
run away from them?

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I
put up a protection.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You do?

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh, always.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I always put
up protection, no matter what.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Before I leave my
house in the morning

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.096 align:middle line:84%
I will go through a ritual
in the shower, where I not

00:33:45.096 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
only cleanse the physical
body, but also the spirit body.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I go through a little
meditation practice,

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.253 align:middle line:84%
where I bring golden light
all through me and around me.

00:33:51.253 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And anything, of, I
call it psychic debris,

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.700 align:middle line:84%
which is holding on to me,
or in my body, or around me,

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.034 align:middle line:90%
I just let it go down the drain.

00:33:59.034 --> 00:34:00.866 align:middle line:84%
And then I put my
beautiful light around me.

00:34:00.866 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:90%
And I'm fine.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.980 align:middle line:90%
And I then program my life.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I say, may God go
before me, today.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.660 align:middle line:90%
And it really does work.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to program
the energy around you.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.465 align:middle line:90%
It works for me.

00:34:09.465 --> 00:34:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you ever
forgotten to do that,

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.449 align:middle line:90%
and you had a bad day?

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:13.199 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:14.449 align:middle line:90%
No, I've never done, no.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You do it every day.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:15.808 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I do it.

00:34:15.808 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
I got into, really,
a habit to do that.

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.179 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
very, very healthy.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's like
working out, isn't it?

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's
like working out.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:21.709 align:middle line:90%
It's like eating breakfast.

00:34:21.709 --> 00:34:23.875 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to eat
breakfast, you take a shower,

00:34:23.875 --> 00:34:24.640 align:middle line:90%
you do the work.

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.139 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:84%
Especially when you're
a medium and you

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.670 align:middle line:90%
work with energy all the time.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:84%
It's really a
responsibility to do that.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:84%
For me, every
medium is different,

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.480 align:middle line:84%
but that's my
regiment that I do,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.110 align:middle line:84%
because I want to be the best
I possibly can be with the work

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:37.880 align:middle line:90%
that I do.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do those on
the other side say about what

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.719 align:middle line:90%
the other side is like?

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.093 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: They say that
we, for this physical level,

00:34:44.093 --> 00:34:45.639 align:middle line:84%
can only see just
a small portion.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.850 align:middle line:90%
We see 10% of it.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.270 align:middle line:84%
The other side
is, they say, it's

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.590 align:middle line:84%
like you would know of the
beautiful things of this earth,

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:57.540 align:middle line:84%
houses and gardens and waterways
and everything, we have that,

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:58.490 align:middle line:90%
but then more.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:59.960 align:middle line:90%
The colors are more vivid.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.190 align:middle line:90%
The colors live.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:04.160 align:middle line:84%
When someone composes music,
you see the notes fly,

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.200 align:middle line:90%
and the inspiration with colors.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And really beautiful
designs come

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.620 align:middle line:90%
from the mind of that composer.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's more real
than this world.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:13.860 align:middle line:90%
It's life.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.860 align:middle line:90%
It's very natural.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:90%
They say, it's so, so natural.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I was with a very famous
medium, physical medium,

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.950 align:middle line:84%
where there used to appear
a voice box in the air.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:90%
And his name was Leslie Flint.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.795 align:middle line:84%
And he's passed now,
but I was lucky enough

00:35:27.795 --> 00:35:28.992 align:middle line:90%
to sit with him three times.

00:35:28.992 --> 00:35:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And Oscar Wilde came through
him, and Queen Victoria.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
come through him.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And people can go
online and actually see

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.600 align:middle line:90%
this, Leslie Flint tapes.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.350 align:middle line:90%
And Oscar Wilde came through.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was so funny,
typical Oscar Wilde.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, in your world,
it's sinful to be natural.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But in our world it's
natural to be sinful.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And the fact, you
just are who you are.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's more beautiful than
we could even imagine here.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.794 align:middle line:84%
It's like our dreams, how
beautiful our dreams could be.

00:35:54.794 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, "What
Dreams May Come," right?

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.501 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: "What
Dreams May Come," yes.

00:35:58.501 --> 00:36:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which is
always fascinating.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody ever talked about
the devil on the other side?

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:06.900 align:middle line:90%
I've never had that.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I've never had the devil.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.890 align:middle line:84%
No, they would say
it's mythological.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:13.927 align:middle line:84%
It's just, it's man-made--
that figure is man-made.

00:36:13.927 --> 00:36:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I've never had that.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So is the other
side, just this part of living,

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:90%
is it energy?

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.380 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it is?

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.171 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:36:21.171 --> 00:36:22.119 align:middle line:90%
We are all energy.

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:84%
In this physical
body, we are energy.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Energy, basically, are
molecules that vibrate and move

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:27.510 align:middle line:90%
at a certain rate of speed.

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.810 align:middle line:84%
The physical body vibrates
energy a certain way.

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And really, the spirit
world vibrates much faster,

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.980 align:middle line:90%
much faster.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.317 align:middle line:84%
So we have around us radio
waves and intelligent waves,

00:36:36.317 --> 00:36:38.150 align:middle line:84%
right now with the
computer and these waves.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:42.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the spirit
faces or the images.

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.190 align:middle line:84%
But yet we receive them on
our computers and radios.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, with your radio
show, and television.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we see them,
like, flowing in the air?

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Because they're there.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.544 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the
vibration they they're on

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:54.710 align:middle line:90%
is a higher level of energy.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.390 align:middle line:84%
It's higher level,
higher frequency.

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:57.930 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same type of thing.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit world is
much, much more-- mm--

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.500 align:middle line:90%
defined with energy.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.530 align:middle line:84%
We see everybody for
who they truly are.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.711 align:middle line:84%
On the physical level, you
can hide your thoughts.

00:37:06.711 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Not in the spirit world.

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:middle line:90%
You are everything.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.520 align:middle line:84%
People see you for exactly
who you are, you know?

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
one thing while I'm here.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
important people realize

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:18.540 align:middle line:84%
that when they pass over
to the spirit side of life,

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.620 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things that
happens is a life review.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Those records.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Those records.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And you look back at your life.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in the spirit
world, there is no time.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.320 align:middle line:90%
You're outside of time.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So you can tend to
look at your life,

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and you're your
own judge and jury.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And you see all the
good things you did.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.200 align:middle line:90%
And the bad things you did.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.360 align:middle line:90%
The tests that you passed.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.760 align:middle line:90%
The tests that you didn't pass.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And you have to try
to forgive yourself

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.890 align:middle line:84%
for what you said to somebody,
for how you treated somebody.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, George,
on this physical earth,

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.582 align:middle line:84%
when we do something to
somebody, or say something,

00:37:49.582 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and we don't feel
good about it, we

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.050 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, I shouldn't
have said that.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Why did I do that?

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Why did I do that?

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And we've
all been there.

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.479 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: All been there.

00:37:55.479 --> 00:37:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Imagine when you're in a
vibration or dimension where

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.400 align:middle line:84%
there is no time,
it's a mental world.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So you relive those
actions, those thoughts,

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.190 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over
again in your head.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.990 align:middle line:84%
That can be in heaven, if
you lived a decent life

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and you tried to demonstrate
love as much as you could.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be hell, where you
tried to get over on somebody,

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.400 align:middle line:84%
or negative, hurt somebody,
that could be your hell, just

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.649 align:middle line:90%
living it over and over again.

00:38:20.649 --> 00:38:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So that could be
your heaven or hell.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:23.710 align:middle line:90%
So what does that tell people?

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.979 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've got to
be responsible for how

00:38:25.979 --> 00:38:27.270 align:middle line:90%
they treat another human being.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Be responsible now,
in this physical body,

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.320 align:middle line:84%
for your thoughts, your
words, and your deeds,

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.574 align:middle line:90%
how you treat another person.

00:38:33.574 --> 00:38:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Because all of
that is going to be

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.837 align:middle line:84%
waiting for you on
this side of life.

00:38:36.837 --> 00:38:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take some
more questions for you, James,

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.420 align:middle line:90%
from our audience.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.214 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:38:42.214 --> 00:38:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.963 align:middle line:90%
I have a ton of questions.

00:38:43.963 --> 00:38:47.730 align:middle line:84%
But the one that I just thought
of was, when people die,

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.439 align:middle line:84%
do they reunite with
other people that died?

00:38:50.439 --> 00:38:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: And with animals?

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And are they all
together over there?

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Mm, hm.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Mm, hm.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Our loved ones are all together.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.760 align:middle line:90%
And our animals are together.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.390 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting,
because the bonds

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.510 align:middle line:84%
that we create on this
earth continue on.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't just drop
away, they continue on.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:07.495 align:middle line:84%
So our loved ones
come to greet us,

00:39:07.495 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:84%
when it's our time to
go to the spirit world.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:90%
They all come to get us.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
reunion, if you will.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And they help us over to
the other side of life.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.410 align:middle line:90%
So we see our loved ones again.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:19.000 align:middle line:84%
We see them, and our
animals, as well.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.834 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are cats more
spiritual than dogs?

00:39:20.834 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I won't
say that, George.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.695 align:middle line:90%
I'm a dog person.

00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:25.357 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: I have been too.

00:39:25.357 --> 00:39:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I think animals
are much more, of course,

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.690 align:middle line:84%
much more in tune than we
are, because they're just

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:31.620 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.810 align:middle line:90%
There's no judgment.

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the human
animal, the human being gets

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:36.890 align:middle line:90%
caught up in judgment.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:38.350 align:middle line:90%
And judgment blocks.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Judgment blocks who they truly
are, because judgment is fear.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.551 align:middle line:84%
And our natural
state is of love.

00:39:43.551 --> 00:39:44.300 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:90%
We're are loving god beings.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you introduce
fear, that foreign energy,

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:51.770 align:middle line:84%
that judgment in there,
it blocks our truth,

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.160 align:middle line:90%
so our perceptions close down.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:90%
But animals are very, very open.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:90%
They just are.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.670 align:middle line:90%
You kick a dog, what happens?

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.350 align:middle line:84%
They come back
and they lick you.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:90%
And the cat comes back.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:06.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just they're wonderful
teachers of unconditional love.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I love the paw print
stories that people will call

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.270 align:middle line:90%
in or talk about.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:90%
That they see on their bed.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, the little
cat that used to live

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.160 align:middle line:90%
is still there, hanging around.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, I once
did a reading for somebody.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And I still remember
to this day.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And this lady's
dog came through.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, the dog
is a little upset.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.160 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, why?

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, this
dog is telling me

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:27.860 align:middle line:90%
that you just got a new dog.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But the new dog is using
the old dog's bowl.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.570 align:middle line:90%
She goes, yes.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.809 align:middle line:84%
I said, well the old
dog does not like that.

00:40:34.809 --> 00:40:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He didn't
like that at all.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's take some more from you.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:39.437 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: So I saw on the
news that there's a company

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.880 align:middle line:84%
selling immortality,
marketing billionaires.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.440 align:middle line:84%
If the human race does
eventually come to a point

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.150 align:middle line:84%
where we become immortal, what's
that mean for our general soul

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:52.980 align:middle line:90%
personalities?

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well, number
one, we are immortal.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:56.570 align:middle line:90%
We are immortal now.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:57.195 align:middle line:90%
We're immortal.

00:40:57.195 --> 00:40:58.500 align:middle line:90%
We are immortal beings.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.210 align:middle line:90%
There's no--

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.029 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What are they selling?

00:41:01.029 --> 00:41:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Immortality.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.361 align:middle line:90%
They're targeting billionaires.

00:41:03.361 --> 00:41:06.005 align:middle line:84%
They use cloning technology to
like replace organs and stuff

00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:90%
like that, unconsciousness.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All right, and
cryogenics and to live forever?

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:10.396 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Not cryogenics.

00:41:10.396 --> 00:41:12.591 align:middle line:84%
It's real live waking
awareness, there.

00:41:12.591 --> 00:41:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Wow, won't that
be interesting when they pass

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:15.350 align:middle line:90%
over?

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I don't think
I would buy one of those.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No, I
wouldn't buy one of those.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.972 align:middle line:90%
I think that's just a gimmick.

00:41:19.972 --> 00:41:20.930 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a gimmick.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
unfortunately going

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.790 align:middle line:90%
toward people's fears of death.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:25.960 align:middle line:90%
You know, you can't die.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.710 align:middle line:90%
There is no death.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what
they're talking about.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:90%
There is no death, whatsoever.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.085 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't
make sense, you see?

00:41:31.085 --> 00:41:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You know, the
great late baseball great,

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.092 align:middle line:84%
Ted Williams, who has
passed on, obviously.

00:41:36.092 --> 00:41:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And he's
in a machine, isn't he?

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:39.844 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: His family
has kept his head--

00:41:39.844 --> 00:41:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I heard this.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: --in a
cryogenic chamber,

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.630 align:middle line:84%
with the hopes of one
day cloning his body,

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and then downloading the memory
from his brain into a computer

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and putting it
into the new body.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't that be remarkable,
one day, if that happens?

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Because, literally,
you would live forever.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.299 align:middle line:84%
Except what do you
do with the soul?

00:42:00.299 --> 00:42:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well,
the soul is not there.

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's gone.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:03.781 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's gone.

00:42:03.781 --> 00:42:05.740 align:middle line:84%
That's just physical
leftover remnants.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a waste.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I wish we could really use
technology in other ways,

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:11.250 align:middle line:84%
you know, to clean
up the planet,

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and to help people
living a quality life,

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.080 align:middle line:90%
instead of stuff like that.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You wouldn't want
to be cryogenically put away

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:19.390 align:middle line:90%
for a while?

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh, I
want to die when I die.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.887 align:middle line:90%
I want to get out of here.

00:42:21.887 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:84%
When I graduate from
this school room,

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:90%
I want to graduate and go.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:26.379 align:middle line:90%
It's hard being here.

00:42:26.379 --> 00:42:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Can I have your suit?

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes, you can.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:29.447 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can, George.

00:42:29.447 --> 00:42:30.530 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome to my suit.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Perfect.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.830 align:middle line:90%
How about one more?

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: When I was
18, my mother passed away.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And I felt her
presence so strongly

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.630 align:middle line:84%
that it convinced me
there was an afterlife.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:44.785 align:middle line:84%
I can actually remember the
day she was no longer there.

00:42:44.785 --> 00:42:47.720 align:middle line:84%
It was about five
years after she died.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And my older brother
died two months ago,

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't felt
his presence at all.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.444 align:middle line:90%
And I wonder why?

00:42:54.444 --> 00:42:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Mm, hm.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So when someone
just passes over,

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.730 align:middle line:84%
there's usually an adjustment
period, if you will.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Because they have to get used
to their new way of life,

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.630 align:middle line:84%
if you will, the new
land that they're in.

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They're busy.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well, it's
really an adjustment.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Because their mind is
very different now,

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:10.090 align:middle line:84%
they realize that
what they think

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:90%
is materialized right away.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:14.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole new way of living
and a whole new adjustment,

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:15.240 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a lot of energy to
come back to this earth level,

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and to project thoughts into
your mind, and feelings.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:23.720 align:middle line:90%
And so it takes a lot of power.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And when someone just recently
passed over, if you will,

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.170 align:middle line:84%
they're gaining back
that energy, that prana,

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:29.120 align:middle line:90%
the energy of life.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.320 align:middle line:84%
They're building back, if
you will, their soul essence.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:36.575 align:middle line:84%
So when they are
completed and to a point

00:43:36.575 --> 00:43:38.450 align:middle line:84%
where they're able to
come back, if you will,

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.810 align:middle line:84%
come back, lower themselves
to this vibration

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and begin to influence
you, and send you thoughts,

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:46.800 align:middle line:84%
send you feelings, have
dreams, memories with them,

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.790 align:middle line:90%
they will do that.

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I find
that people want it

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.054 align:middle line:90%
so badly that they block.

00:43:52.054 --> 00:43:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.975 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That they
just block their minds.

00:43:53.975 --> 00:43:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You push too hard.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because
they want them.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.660 align:middle line:90%
I want them.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I want them.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.910 align:middle line:84%
If they would just relax,
it'll give the spirit room

00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:59.870 align:middle line:90%
to come in.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:00.516 align:middle line:90%
So try it.

00:44:00.516 --> 00:44:01.270 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:02.220 align:middle line:90%
It'll happen.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Because love never dies.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Love continues on.

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:07.331 align:middle line:84%
You know, love, like
life will continue on.

00:44:07.331 --> 00:44:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Just a matter
of time, isn't it.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's just a
matter of time and relaxing

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:10.930 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Knowing they're
in a better place.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:84%
They are in a
better, better place.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the hard
place, down here.

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:17.320 align:middle line:84%
This physical earth
is a hard, hard place.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.770 align:middle line:90%
A lot of hard lessons here.

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Tough lessons here.

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.446 align:middle line:90%
But there is a better place.

00:44:21.446 --> 00:44:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it possible,
though, that that spirit,

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:27.900 align:middle line:84%
his brother, will move on and
just not communicate with him?

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well, I
think that his brother is

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.770 align:middle line:84%
communicating with him, because
I was talking a little earlier,

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and he just doesn't hear him.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.760 align:middle line:84%
That's really more
of what it is,

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.489 align:middle line:84%
because I believe the brother
is around, and very strongly.

00:44:39.489 --> 00:44:40.530 align:middle line:90%
But he's not hearing him.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it's almost
like a radio station?

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.420 align:middle line:84%
You got to tune it in to
the right frequency, right?

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.794 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
You're the expert.

00:44:45.794 --> 00:44:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right, George.

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Its tuning in to that frequency.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not on the right
frequency, you can't hear it.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:51.630 align:middle line:90%
The connection isn't there.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:52.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a wavelength.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:53.697 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:44:53.697 --> 00:44:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you're too busy
thinking about things,

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:57.196 align:middle line:84%
and the dial's going
all over the place,

00:44:57.196 --> 00:44:58.516 align:middle line:90%
you're not tuning in.

00:44:58.516 --> 00:44:59.640 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what happens.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.536 align:middle line:84%
You have to quiet yourself, and
start listening and tuning in.

00:45:02.536 --> 00:45:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you
have to listen.

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:06.820 align:middle line:84%
We've been listening
to James Van Praagh.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to come back
with him in just a moment

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:10.980 align:middle line:90%
here, on "Beyond Belief."

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.342 align:middle line:90%
So standby.

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:15.234 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:15.234 --> 00:45:18.312 align:middle line:90%


00:45:18.312 --> 00:45:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Welcome back
to "Beyond Belief"

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.213 align:middle line:90%
with medium James Van Praagh.

00:45:22.213 --> 00:45:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And James, you're going to do
sort of a mass reading here

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:27.360 align:middle line:90%
with the audience.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards, we'll
bring in some individuals.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And let's see what you do.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
whoever I pick up.

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:32.800 align:middle line:90%
And we'll just see what happens.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All right,
do your thing.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: All right.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:35.327 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:45:35.327 --> 00:45:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to come over here
to this young lady, here.

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:38.160 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:38.545 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Allie.

00:45:38.545 --> 00:45:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Allie.

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.555 align:middle line:84%
So behind you is a man who
would be a father figure to you.

00:45:41.555 --> 00:45:42.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just to ask you to say,
yes and acknowledge or not.

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Don't cross your legs, because
I won't talk about that.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.500 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you that he's
coming to the left side of you.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And he's a big guy,
when he comes in here.

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:51.820 align:middle line:90%
He's big.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.005 align:middle line:90%
He's a big man, to me.

00:45:53.005 --> 00:45:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you that, was
there a separation between you

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and him before he passed over,
as far either physical location

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.821 align:middle line:90%
or were you not able to see him?

00:46:01.821 --> 00:46:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: He was in
California and I was

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:04.210 align:middle line:90%
in Colorado.

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well,
that's physical separation.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So you were in Colorado,
he was in California.

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.040 align:middle line:90%
That's physical.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:08.640 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Because he's giving me the
awareness that you were not

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:12.966 align:middle line:84%
able to see him, or
there was a, something

00:46:12.966 --> 00:46:14.590 align:middle line:84%
you weren't able to
be with each other.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And also, the month of August
is very significant, by the way.

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
connection with August.

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I also want to ask you, he's
talking about a brother of his,

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and there was a problem,
he's telling me,

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:25.967 align:middle line:90%
in the family with his brother.

00:46:25.967 --> 00:46:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And they did not see eye to eye.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.610 align:middle line:90%
Would you understand that?

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.421 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
after your father passed away,

00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:33.780 align:middle line:84%
the brother kind
of came out again.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
problems there.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And this sounds very,
very interesting,

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.400 align:middle line:90%
but he's-- he's apologizing.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.712 align:middle line:84%
He understands the
situation better now.

00:46:43.712 --> 00:46:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Can I say it to you that way?

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:46.820 align:middle line:84%
He understands the
situation better now.

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:51.952 align:middle line:84%
And who shared work together
or had a company together?

00:46:51.952 --> 00:46:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: My dad and his--

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Brother?

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: No,
not his borther.

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.581 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Who?

00:46:55.581 --> 00:46:56.022 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: He had a partner.

00:46:56.022 --> 00:46:56.904 align:middle line:90%
He was a lawyer.

00:46:56.904 --> 00:46:57.790 align:middle line:90%
But his brother--

00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So he had a-- and the partner is
still alive, is he, right now?

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: He may be.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:01.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Yeah, I think he is.

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:04.182 align:middle line:84%
I think there was some
problems with money,

00:47:04.182 --> 00:47:05.723 align:middle line:84%
or trying to figure
out what happened

00:47:05.723 --> 00:47:08.300 align:middle line:84%
to that money of that company
after your father passed over.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.250 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me
there might have been

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:11.830 align:middle line:84%
problems with getting money
back, or getting something

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:13.660 align:middle line:90%
from that company from that man.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.664 align:middle line:90%
Would you be aware of that?

00:47:15.664 --> 00:47:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No, not really.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Not really.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Would you find out?

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there's
something which

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:20.810 align:middle line:90%
was questionable about that.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.885 align:middle line:84%
Your mother is still
alive here on this earth?

00:47:22.885 --> 00:47:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I need for you to
tell her you love her.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Really?

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Because your
father's telling me,

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't want time to go by
without you forgiving her.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Would that makes sense
to you, yes or no?

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:35.910 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:36.550 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very important that
you realize that forgiveness

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.340 align:middle line:84%
is very, very strong
and very important.

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have to forgive others,
because we don't know somebody

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.770 align:middle line:90%
until we walk in their shoes.

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So your mother tried
the best she could,

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:48.690 align:middle line:84%
but she doesn't
believe in herself,

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:50.129 align:middle line:84%
that's why she
acts out like that.

00:47:50.129 --> 00:47:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I know you were very close to
your dad more than your mother,

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:53.760 align:middle line:90%
would that make sense to you?

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I want to let
you know that your dad is still

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.660 align:middle line:90%
around you, very, very much so.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.834 align:middle line:84%
And he's with you with
music, by the way.

00:47:59.834 --> 00:48:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So I know there's certain
music you might hear

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:02.950 align:middle line:90%
and you think of him.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And I want to tell you that.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:06.230 align:middle line:84%
He's also referring
to a new car,

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:07.980 align:middle line:90%
or is someone getting a new car?

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's influential
with the new car.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Would understand about that?

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, he
was really into cars.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.695 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK, because
he's talking about you.

00:48:13.695 --> 00:48:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Did just get a new car?

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Or was it--

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Getting a new car.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, very much.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Because he's talking
about getting the new car.

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:20.408 align:middle line:84%
He's with you
getting this new car.

00:48:20.408 --> 00:48:22.930 align:middle line:84%
He's influencing you and
helping you out with this car.

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:23.670 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.211 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
leave you with that.

00:48:25.211 --> 00:48:26.840 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of love from him, OK.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Bless you.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.030 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.372 align:middle line:84%
I want to come over here and,
what is you name, please?

00:48:30.372 --> 00:48:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Stephanie.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Stephanie.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.448 align:middle line:84%
Now Stephanie, I have a lady
here who would be your mother.

00:48:34.448 --> 00:48:36.634 align:middle line:84%
And I know your
mom's passed over.

00:48:36.634 --> 00:48:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's a
brother, also passed over,

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.600 align:middle line:90%
then, with her?

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.304 align:middle line:84%
And is there, her mother also
passed over, your grandmother?

00:48:42.304 --> 00:48:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask
you, did someone

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.520 align:middle line:84%
live with your grandmother
for a little bit of time?

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no?

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, very much.

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Because she's
acknowledging that.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Now who was a smoker?

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Did you mom smoke, please?

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm getting,
[INHALE] and I'm

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:56.277 align:middle line:90%
smoking these cigarettes.

00:48:56.277 --> 00:48:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
she's coming in like.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And I like a good
cigarette, she goes.

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I like a good cigarette, it
helps me relax, she said.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.930 align:middle line:90%
It helps me relax.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.897 align:middle line:84%
And I also go out to like a
little deck or a little patio

00:49:06.897 --> 00:49:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and I just want to sit
there and have a cigarette.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.004 align:middle line:84%
And that's the memory
your mother is giving me.

00:49:11.004 --> 00:49:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Would that make sense?

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, it does.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know
she found your brother.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Found your brother, and I want
about the drinking situation.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure if
that's your brother who

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:22.460 align:middle line:90%
had the drinking problem there?

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.020 align:middle line:90%
Would that make sense to you?

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I'm
not judging it.

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:27.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just information
they are giving me

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.710 align:middle line:90%
so you'll recognize it, yes?

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So I want to tell you that he's
working on his own situations

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.100 align:middle line:90%
with the drinking.

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a
divorce in the family also.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So he must have gone
through a divorce,

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.230 align:middle line:84%
an upsetment, an
emotional upsetment.

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:41.695 align:middle line:90%
And this is a friend of yours?

00:49:41.695 --> 00:49:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Sister.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Sister,
oh your sister.

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:44.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you understand the
circ-- so you understand about,

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.850 align:middle line:84%
so your brother, and there was a
divorce in the family with him.

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And there was emotional
upheaval with him.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't believe
in himself, at all.

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:55.886 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you, who
was involved with drugs?

00:49:55.886 --> 00:49:58.381 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I don't
know if it was him.

00:49:58.381 --> 00:50:01.600 align:middle line:84%
With his last wife, we honestly
don't know the true story.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:04.906 align:middle line:84%
I just got to tell
you that, I've

00:50:04.906 --> 00:50:07.440 align:middle line:84%
got to tell you that there's
something with drugs, as well.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I feel like this
man is depressed

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.210 align:middle line:90%
before he passes over.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I feel like he's
his own worst enemy.

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like he doesn't
want tot be here anymore, OK?

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:17.480 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Your mother is
taking care of him.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that your
mother is more of a mother,

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:22.600 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of life to him,

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.930 align:middle line:84%
than she was able to
be here on this earth.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Would that makes sense to you?

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:26.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.384 align:middle line:84%
Because I get this lady,
exuberant, full of life,

00:50:29.384 --> 00:50:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and I feel that she
lost a lot of weight

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:32.400 align:middle line:90%
before she passes over.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.692 align:middle line:90%
I fell like she wasn't herself.

00:50:33.692 --> 00:50:35.816 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if this
was a cancerous condition,

00:50:35.816 --> 00:50:37.515 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not sure,
but I feel like I'm

00:50:37.515 --> 00:50:40.160 align:middle line:84%
being really, really--
my prana, my energy level

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.000 align:middle line:90%
has bee drained out of me.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Drained out of me.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And before I passed to
the other side of life,

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.664 align:middle line:84%
I cannot even understand
what's going on in this life.

00:50:47.664 --> 00:50:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So I would tell you that
your mother, her mind

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.870 align:middle line:84%
wasn't herself
before she passes.

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And I would say her mind was
not hers, it could have been

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.090 align:middle line:84%
several months, could have
been even close to a year.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.980 align:middle line:90%
I feel like my mind is not mine.

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.870 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like I'm out of it.

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:02.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of it.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So it might be early
Alzheimer's, or senility.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:06.670 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense to you?

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:07.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
that she's dancing.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:10.430 align:middle line:90%
She's dancing.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And is your dad on the
other side, as well?

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Because he comes to greet
me, and he takes my hand.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:18.169 align:middle line:90%
He takes my hand.

00:51:18.169 --> 00:51:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So he must have been there
before her, because he takes

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.350 align:middle line:84%
her hand from the
bed, takes her hand

00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:24.880 align:middle line:90%
and he greets her over there.

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And he brings her a
brand new dress, OK?

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And now I would tell
you that there's

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.310 align:middle line:84%
a picture of them where
she's wearing a hat.

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:33.522 align:middle line:84%
And she has gloves,
and there's a dress,

00:51:33.522 --> 00:51:34.730 align:middle line:90%
and she's talking about this.

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Now I would go to a
wedding picture, also.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And somebody has a
wedding photo out.

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you have the
wedding photo out?

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Or do you know about
this wedding photo?

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: No, but
I have their pictures.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You
have the pictures.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:45.270 align:middle line:84%
You recognize the picture
that she's describing?

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you that
she's very happy with him

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.590 align:middle line:90%
in the spirit world.

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Very, very happy.

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:51.830 align:middle line:90%
And they're arm in arm.

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And I got to say, they're
dancing a little bit.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.612 align:middle line:90%
And I just have to say that.

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:57.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going back to New
York for something.

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know why, but
I want to go with them

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.224 align:middle line:90%
back to New York.

00:52:00.224 --> 00:52:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So I don't if they
went there on a visit

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and that was a
big deal for them?

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.278 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
about going to that area.

00:52:05.278 --> 00:52:06.907 align:middle line:90%
Would you recognize that?

00:52:06.907 --> 00:52:08.212 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: New Jersey.

00:52:08.212 --> 00:52:09.545 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: New Jersey, fine.

00:52:09.545 --> 00:52:10.580 align:middle line:90%
I saw the Empire State Building.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And James, we'll
have time for one more person,

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:13.390 align:middle line:90%
in a second here?

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So let me leave you
with that, but they're

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.840 align:middle line:90%
around you all the time.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And I love the garden.

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I love the garden you made for
them, because it's a memorial

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:21.840 align:middle line:84%
garden for your brother
and for your mother.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.030 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:24.070 align:middle line:90%
And it has a flag.

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:25.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.430 align:middle line:90%
So I'll leave with that.

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:27.740 align:middle line:90%
May I come to you, ma'am?

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to-- can we
do it up here, maybe.

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, sure.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Would
you mind coming up here,

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.610 align:middle line:90%
and we can do it?

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:32.865 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:32.865 --> 00:52:33.540 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:34.450 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Susie.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Hi,
Susie, nice to meet you.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.101 align:middle line:90%
Come on, have a seat.

00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK?

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.100 align:middle line:90%
We'll just do it quick.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, go ahead.

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:39.740 align:middle line:90%
A few minutes to go here, James.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Two minutes, OK.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.205 align:middle line:84%
There's a gentleman next
to you, and your husband

00:52:43.205 --> 00:52:44.470 align:middle line:90%
had passed, correct?

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And was he in a
hospital when he passed over,

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:46.780 align:middle line:90%
please?

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No he wasn't.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Was he at home?

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Was he in a bed?

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK, can I just
tell you that I'm seeing a man

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.830 align:middle line:84%
lying in a bed, and
you're stroking his hand,

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:55.712 align:middle line:84%
you're stroking his
hand and his hair.

00:52:55.712 --> 00:52:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you that
you're whispering to him,

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're talking
to him, and you're

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.475 align:middle line:90%
reading to him at one point.

00:53:00.475 --> 00:53:01.225 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:53:01.225 --> 00:53:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, honey,
don't be afraid.

00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:06.233 align:middle line:84%
And can I just say
that you helped him

00:53:06.233 --> 00:53:07.475 align:middle line:90%
to the other side of life.

00:53:07.475 --> 00:53:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Can I say that to you.

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, another one,
his body was not his own.

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:12.510 align:middle line:90%
And his body was not his own.

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:13.750 align:middle line:90%
He just keeps on saying that.

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And I see his baseball
cap, a baseball

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.250 align:middle line:90%
cap you own of his, he said.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.383 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK, because
I'm talking about, yes,

00:53:21.383 --> 00:53:23.650 align:middle line:84%
he said a baseball cap and
a jacket that you have.

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And did he ever like to go
fishing sometimes, or go

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:27.572 align:middle line:90%
sports, do some sports?

00:53:27.572 --> 00:53:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Fishing,
occasionally.

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Fishing, thank you.

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And do you have a fishing
rod of his, still?

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I do.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And is it in
the garage that you would have

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.430 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's leaning up against
the corner, he's showing me.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you that
he's very happy about a memory

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:44.150 align:middle line:84%
about you and him going fishing
at one time, or going out,

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and it was at a
lake or something.

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.450 align:middle line:90%
And he's talking about this.

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:49.572 align:middle line:84%
And did you give
him medications?

00:53:49.572 --> 00:53:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You know like the
bottles are still sitting here.

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:54.721 align:middle line:84%
And you had a timing where you
had to give him certain pills.

00:53:54.721 --> 00:53:55.877 align:middle line:90%
And he knows about that.

00:53:55.877 --> 00:53:56.710 align:middle line:90%
He knows about that.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:58.614 align:middle line:84%
And his eyes, by the
way, were affected.

00:53:58.614 --> 00:53:59.530 align:middle line:90%
His eyes get affected.

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I can't see things,
at one point.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of goes into a
coma, or just goes out of it.

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I just got to say,
thank you for helping me.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:07.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
the photograph.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.000 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
photograph every day.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.880 align:middle line:84%
He says, you look at my
photograph every day.

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And I do think you
kiss the photograph.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And um, can I just tell you,
he kisses you good night,

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:18.050 align:middle line:84%
every night when
you go to sleep.

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:20.602 align:middle line:84%
And you must have just gone
on to his side of the bed.

00:54:20.602 --> 00:54:22.810 align:middle line:84%
You moved over to his side
of the bed, is that right?

00:54:22.810 --> 00:54:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I did.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You did,
thank you, very much.

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.595 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, you
know, she has moved over

00:54:26.595 --> 00:54:29.690 align:middle line:84%
to my side of the bed, where I
slept, so we could be closer.

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's a dog,
by the way, too.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So the dog is at the end of
the bed,and the dog comes up

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:34.040 align:middle line:90%
and licks you.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.482 align:middle line:90%
He comes through that dog.

00:54:35.482 --> 00:54:36.940 align:middle line:90%
And I know you know that.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, honey?

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Good, God bless you.

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.038 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:41.038 --> 00:54:42.251 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:42.251 --> 00:54:43.792 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: All
right, sweetheart.

00:54:43.792 --> 00:54:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you, so much.

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:45.718 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
You're very welcome.

00:54:45.718 --> 00:54:46.800 align:middle line:90%
You're very welcome.

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Gosh, James, you
were going to have me crying

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.280 align:middle line:90%
for a moment there.

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well, that's
what it's about, George.

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It gets
emotional, doesn't it?

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's
very emotional.

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's
very, very emotional.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we had more
time, of course,

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:57.654 align:middle line:84%
we could develop
it even further,

00:54:57.654 --> 00:54:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit can
really know how

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:01.420 align:middle line:84%
to send the thought,
how to send the feeling

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.000 align:middle line:90%
and blend more with me.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.256 align:middle line:84%
But because we're on TV, it's
a very quick type of thing.

00:55:06.256 --> 00:55:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But when I really
have time, they

00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:09.219 align:middle line:84%
can really start
blending through me.

00:55:09.219 --> 00:55:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And their personalities
come through.

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And when this
is happening, I mean,

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:17.940 align:middle line:84%
you are talking to her about
episodes, and what do you hear?

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Are you hearing
voices in your head?

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.815 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's almost
like the spirit is downloading

00:55:21.815 --> 00:55:26.060 align:middle line:84%
into my mind memories, if you
will, memories, observations.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.597 align:middle line:84%
They were watching this lady
move to the side of the bed.

00:55:28.597 --> 00:55:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So he's telling me
I was watching her.

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.055 align:middle line:90%
It's like having a conversation.

00:55:31.055 --> 00:55:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you pick
up these thoughts?

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's like
having a conversation.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, OK.

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And
it's very, very fast.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.753 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's a little
like remote viewing.

00:55:36.753 --> 00:55:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewers tell me, don't
think about what you're doing,

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:42.290 align:middle line:90%
just let it come in.

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:44.195 align:middle line:84%
And that's generally
what it's going to be.

00:55:44.195 --> 00:55:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, you have to
just relax and let-- you know,

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:47.736 align:middle line:90%
you're not in control.

00:55:47.736 --> 00:55:50.500 align:middle line:84%
You just got to let
your ego step aside

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.489 align:middle line:90%
and let spirit come in.

00:55:51.489 --> 00:55:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
there with the ego,

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and you're worried about it,
then spirit can't come through.

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.380 align:middle line:90%
There's no room for spirit.

00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's hear it
for James Van Praagh.

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:04.842 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:04.842 --> 00:56:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hope this edition
of "Beyond Belief"

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.430 align:middle line:84%
has helped you understand what's
on the other side just a little

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:15.520 align:middle line:84%
bit so whenever that moment
comes, you won't be scared,

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:17.174 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be prepared.

00:56:17.174 --> 00:56:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory
and we'll see you

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:20.680 align:middle line:84%
on our next edition
of "Beyond Belief."

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.156 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:22.156 --> 00:56:26.660 align:middle line:90%
