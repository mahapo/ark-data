>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.690 align:middle line:10%
You know, one of the great
mysteries of this planet

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:10%
has to do with the sightings
of a creature called

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:10%
Sasquatch, Bigfoot.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Christine Parker
lives in Arkansas,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and she has been plagued
with these sightings.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.562 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: For many,
Bigfoot is a source

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:90%
of endless fascination.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But for one woman, he is
a source of constant fear.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:10%
Christine Parker
claims Bigfoot is

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.750 align:middle line:10%
just one of many
unknown beings living

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:10%
in the forest near her house,
shattering her reality.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:10%
In the "100 Bigfoot
Nights" series,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:10%
she meticulously
chronicles her family's

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:10%
sufferings, as well as evidence
of what exactly is out there.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:10%
That includes unexplained
property damage

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:10%
and relentless harassment.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
She explains the only myth about
Bigfoot is that he is harmless.

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So what
you're going to hear

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:10%
today is Christine's
story, the story

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:10%
of Bigfoot, a family
of Bigfoot that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:10%
have plagued her and her
family for how many years now,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:10%
Christine?

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.868 align:middle line:10%
>>CHRISTINE PARKER:
Since the night

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:10%
we discovered them
was October 13th,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:10%
2012, that we became aware that
they were in the neighborhood.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now when you say
you say, "became aware,"

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:10%
what was that?

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:10%
What happened?

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: It was the night
that we heard a howl.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:84%
We heard it holler
for the first time.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:10%
Prior to that, we had lived in
the house for several years,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:10%
and strange things would happen.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.062 align:middle line:84%
But we never put-- you
would never think that.

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:49.770 align:middle line:84%
You would never put
two and two together.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you scared
when you heard the howl?

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: No.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:84%
It was more that
it was something

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
you never heard before,
and you were more curious.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.894 align:middle line:84%
An animal or something
making that sound.

00:02:02.894 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going to listen
to some sounds in a moment,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
but were these sounds of
wolves or anything like that,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.400 align:middle line:84%
or just something you
had never heard before?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Just something
we had never heard before.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:84%
My husband had-- what happened
was my husband had set up

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:84%
our Halloween
decorations for the year,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and he spent the
day decorating it.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And that night, he went outside
to adjust the spotlights.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: And each
year we buy new stuff

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:10%
for the following year.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.770 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: He bought a big blowup
tree with ghosts on top of it.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:10%
It had ghosts around the top.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:10%
And he put it on
the front porch.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.190 align:middle line:10%
So he goes out that
evening, and he

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:10%
goes to set the spotlights,
so everything shines.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:90%
And he hears it.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:90%
It starts hollering.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:90%
And he hears this hollering.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Right away, he thinks, you know,
am I hearing this correctly?

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Then he hears it again.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Then he realizes
something's wrong.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You know how you
get that feeling?

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.865 align:middle line:90%
It's in your gut, right?

00:02:57.865 --> 00:02:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Because it's
vibrating through him,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and the sound is so
loud that he thinks,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:90%
you know, something's wrong.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:90%
And he listens.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.340 align:middle line:90%
He hears it again.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.342 align:middle line:84%
So he gets up, and he
gets into the house.

00:03:08.342 --> 00:03:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And he keeps his
eye on the forest,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:90%
but he gets into the house.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And he comes in there, and
I'm watching television.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting on the
couch with the dogs.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm just enjoying a show.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just being you.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Being me.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:10%
And he comes in, and
he leans over to me.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking,
he's back so fast.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:10%
He just went out there.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me, you want
to hear something strange

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:90%
coming from the forest?

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:10%
And he's behind me on the
couch, and I look at him,

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:10%
and I'm like, what?

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:10%
What is it?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: I don't
want to go outside.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to hear it.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to get up.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the couch.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And he says, it's something
I've never heard before.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.482 align:middle line:90%
You've got to hear this.

00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:90%
So I'm thinking, oh, god.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Like a dog?

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Can you just give me an idea?

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing I've
ever heard before.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close was
the sound to your house?

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Across the street.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.885 align:middle line:90%
Across a street.

00:03:57.885 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Across the street
from our house.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You could throw
a rock across the street.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Oh, yeah.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That close.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.086 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Our house is here.

00:04:03.086 --> 00:04:05.665 align:middle line:10%
It sits on a corner, and
it rolls around the corner.

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:10%
Across the street from us--

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.789 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Neighbors.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: There's no
neighbors on one side,

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
because we're at the end
of the housing track.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So on one side of us, it goes
around, and it's the end.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:90%
And there's houses behind us.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And then on the
other side, there's

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:90%
like an easement, quite a bit.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
house starts, and then

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:84%
houses on both sides of the
street go up from there.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Across the street from our
house, there's a forest.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.980 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was a vacant lot.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And then past it, there's a
house that sits next to it,

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:90%
and then the houses start.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:10%
So it's just-- it would
be as if your house were

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:10%
here, and across the street,
you had a vacant lot.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:10%
And then it goes
around the corner,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.610 align:middle line:10%
and there's a house that
sits on the corner over here.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of it is
just the forest, you know,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and what's there, the
lot, whatever it is.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it was that far.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:90%
And then across is our house.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:10%
So it's across the street.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Our mailbox sits directly
across the street from where

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.870 align:middle line:90%
the pathway goes into it.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was just--
it has an easement,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:90%
a 10-foot easement.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
We have our house, the
street, the 10-foot easement,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden,
the tree line starts.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.529 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a pathway,
and then past the tree line,

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:84%
there's more trees,
and I mean they're big.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.460 align:middle line:90%
They go all the way back.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought
it was just a lot.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm from California.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: You think they're--

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.027 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Much bigger
than a lot, right?

00:05:30.027 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Well, yeah, but I
thought it was a vacant lot.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, all those
houses behind it.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.185 align:middle line:90%
There's houses next to it.

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's
pretty woodsy, right?

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: It's woodsy, you know.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we heard it.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I came-- when
he heard it that night,

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I went out the front
door, and I started

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:90%
to walk across the porch.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:90%
And that thing went off again.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear it, and
I went, what is that?

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But did
it sound animal?

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: It-- you knew
it had to be an animal,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:10%
and it sounded like something
in pain or something screaming.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't an animal that
you could recognize because

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:90%
of the volume and because--

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.183 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: --it was a tone.

00:06:09.183 --> 00:06:10.580 align:middle line:90%
It was a "wah!"

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.790 align:middle line:90%
I mean this thing went off.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I want to
listen to some of these sounds,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:84%
so what we're going
to do is we're

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
going to play a series of
three for you several times.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
This one-- we have one that is
called The Language Number One.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.430 align:middle line:90%
We're going to listen to that.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:84%
We're going to listen to one
that is called the Mommy Mommy

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Mother.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll have you explain
that for us, Christine.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll hear
some other vocal cries,

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:90%
so let's listen to these three.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:90%
[MUFFLED SOUNDS]

00:06:41.740 --> 00:07:34.465 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.465 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:90%
All right, Christine.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's go through those first
three sounds that we heard.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Very strange, I'll admit that.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.180 align:middle line:84%
What was the first one
we were listening to?

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: The first one was the
night we cut back the forest,

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:10%
the day we cut it.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I had seen a tree
move that afternoon

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.230 align:middle line:84%
looking out the window, because
they were there during the day.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's scary.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So I told my husband
when he woke up,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, if we just cut the
front of the forest, the lower

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.567 align:middle line:84%
branches along the side,
they couldn't hide there.

00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:09.025 align:middle line:84%
And then I-- because I thought
it was ridiculous to be-- it

00:08:09.025 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:90%
was in the beginning.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At that
point, you still

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.964 align:middle line:84%
don't know what we're
talking about here, right?

00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Well, we
found out that night,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.088 align:middle line:84%
and then an
investigator comes out,

00:08:16.088 --> 00:08:17.755 align:middle line:84%
and we go through a
whole investigation.

00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:18.554 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:18.554 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:90%
We're on--

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A Bigfoot sighter.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: A Bigfoot
investigator, yes,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:90%
comes to the house.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:10%
And after all that happens,
and we stop going in the forest

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:10%
and place-- doing all the
stuff they do, one day--

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did you call
them, or what happened?

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Oh.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.635 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, what happened
was after we heard it,

00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:10%
we didn't know what it was.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And that's that
first sound we just heard.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.674 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: That was the first
one I was telling you about.

00:08:41.674 --> 00:08:43.444 align:middle line:84%
And after we-- we
couldn't identify it.

00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:44.653 align:middle line:90%
So I kept listening to howls.

00:08:44.653 --> 00:08:47.027 align:middle line:84%
I kept going on the internet
and listening and listening,

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.437 align:middle line:90%
because I needed to identify it.

00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:90%
I had to know what it was.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: I mean it's
not something you forget.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And our son finally came in,
and I had played all of them,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:90%
and I was getting a headache.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And he came in, and he
said, here, let me do it.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.731 align:middle line:84%
So he started playing
them on the computer,

00:09:00.731 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:90%
and I sat on the couch.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.106 align:middle line:84%
And he was playing them and
playing them and playing them,

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and then he played one,
and it was perfect.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:90%
It sounded just like it.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.015 align:middle line:84%
The only thing was the one we
heard was louder and clearer.

00:09:11.015 --> 00:09:11.815 align:middle line:90%
I was relieved.

00:09:11.815 --> 00:09:12.776 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, my god.

00:09:12.776 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank god you found
what animal did it.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:90%
You know, you found it.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what
kind of animal is it?

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it's a Bigfoot.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:84%
It was a recording
of a Bigfoot in Ohio.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did it freak you out?

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Oh, god, yes.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.520 align:middle line:10%
I thought-- I couldn't
believe what he said.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's
a Bigfoot sound.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:90%
And it just didn't register.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you got
to be kidding me.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So I get up, and I
go to the computer.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to see what
he's talking about.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Like let me see what
you're looking at.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:90%
So he showed me the recording.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, this is what
it's identified as.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, no way.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:90%
But it was the sound.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:90%
It was it.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Now when I was playing howlings,
Bigfoot kept coming up.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:90%
I kept ignoring it.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I would have never
played them, never.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.045 align:middle line:90%
The last thing on my mind.

00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:08.324 align:middle line:84%
But he said, no,
that's what it is.

00:10:08.324 --> 00:10:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So then we called my husband
in so that he could hear it.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:90%
And he played it for him.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:10%
And he listened, and he
goes, yeah that's it,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:10%
except the one we heard
was louder and clearer.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.474 align:middle line:10%
What kind of animal is it?

00:10:20.474 --> 00:10:21.306 align:middle line:10%
That's what he said.

00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:22.390 align:middle line:10%
What kind of animal is it?

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't even speak, and
my son said, Dad, Bigfoot.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.177 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's Bigfoot.

00:10:26.177 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: My husband
went-- he looked at me,

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.375 align:middle line:10%
looked at him like,
are you kidding me?

00:10:30.375 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And then he turned
around, and he left.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:90%
He just walked out.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we heard the
howlings in the second clip,

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
but the third, I heard
a lot of dogs barking.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.300 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Those are our dogs.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: The Bigfoots
approach the fence.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:90%
We had a dog at the time.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:90%
She passed since-- Foxy.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:90%
She was the oldest.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.980 align:middle line:90%
This dog used to wake us up.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.479 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.479 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:84%
It's three years
I'm trying to cover,

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.240 align:middle line:84%
but she used to always
bark a warning bark, what

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:84%
we know now is a
warning bark, but we

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:90%
didn't know that at the time.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: She always
would go out there

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.372 align:middle line:90%
and stand on the porch.

00:11:02.372 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
She'd want to go
out late at night.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:84%
She'd hit the door,
and we'd say, Foxy.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:90%
We'd let her out.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:90%
She'd go outside.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:84%
She's down on the
porch, and she'd just

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
go off, bah, bah,
bah, doing that bark.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:84%
She'd go out there,
bark, we're thinking

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:84%
waking up all the neighbors,
1, 2 o'clock in the morning.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:20.976 align:middle line:90%
She'd come back in.

00:11:20.976 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
We'd say, Foxy, get in
here, and quit that barking.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:90%
She'd get in.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Then she'd just look at us.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
She would never go
to the fence, and she

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.060 align:middle line:84%
would-- that was what
we found interesting

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
was that she would bark, but
she wouldn't go near the fence.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:90%
We have a huge fence.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She sensed something.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.186 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: She would just
want to go out there,

00:11:37.186 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and it would be
like-- it was weird.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.781 align:middle line:84%
She'd go out there and just go
off barking, and then come in.

00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And at this point, you
hadn't seen anything, right?

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: No.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, prior to us
discovering it,

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.499 align:middle line:84%
one time when Foxy
was barking-- Foxy

00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
used to bark in the house,
2 o'clock in the morning, 1,

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:90%
2 o'clock in the morning.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
She would lay with her little
face on the window sill.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She sensed
them outside, right?

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: She could see them.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.416 align:middle line:90%
She was watching them.

00:11:58.416 --> 00:12:00.577 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How close would
they come to the house?

00:12:00.577 --> 00:12:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: They'd come
right up to our house.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going to
get into-- in a moment,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get
into her descriptions

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:90%
of these creatures.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
We've got some video that
I want you to explain,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with a Bigfoot
in your neighbor's yard.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.134 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at that
while you tell us, Christine,

00:12:17.134 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:90%
what we're looking at.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.554 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: OK.

00:12:19.554 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Now what are we
looking at here, Christine?

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.345 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: This is a
night vision camera

00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:10%
that we placed in
the pool area, which

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:10%
is outside our French doors.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And the dogs started barking,
and so I began to record it.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.310 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I didn't have
the cameras on recorders.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I would have to place
my camera on a tripod,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:84%
and then aim it at
the television screen.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the dogs started
their barking-- two of them

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:84%
were barking-- I placed
the camera on the tripod,

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.150 align:middle line:90%
and I started to film.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
As they kept going on barking,
my husband, of course,

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:90%
went out to look.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed that the
neighbor was outside.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Our neighbor, who I
called Bob in the book,

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.904 align:middle line:84%
he was out there
tending his garden--

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are we--

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: --chasing something.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.558 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are we looking
at on the far right hand

00:13:03.558 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:90%
side walking by?

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:05.821 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that?

00:13:05.821 --> 00:13:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Mm-hm.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.606 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that it?

00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:90%
The creature?

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.706 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: The dark
one, see the dark?

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's on the far
right hand side of the screen.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:10%
In the video
portion, you actually

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:10%
saw this thing move through,
so that's it right there.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Mm-hm.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:90%
They go back and forth.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:90%
There's more than one.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could see his arms.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle line:84%
You could see the head, and he's
hairy as all get up, isn't he?

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: It appears to be so.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.395 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's
what it looks like

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:10%
and what it was
looking like when

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:10%
they were going around Bob.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.160 align:middle line:10%
Bob was out there.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.274 align:middle line:10%
He was human.

00:13:38.274 --> 00:13:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And you could clearly
see the difference

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:90%
between him and them.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I cut him
out of the video,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.622 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want to
film my neighbor, you know.

00:13:48.622 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There again,
there he goes again

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
on the far right hand
side, really fast.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.176 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Goes across.

00:13:53.176 --> 00:13:55.602 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.602 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here it comes again.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
There it is, and
then it goes back.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
How many creatures, Christine,
do you think are out there?

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Well--

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your neighborhood.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.249 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: I've seen a group--

00:14:06.249 --> 00:14:07.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
a family of them.

00:14:07.665 --> 00:14:08.638 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Quite a few.

00:14:08.638 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Quite a few of them, and I don't
think they're from one family.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I think there are-- I think
they gather sometimes,

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and I think they're
different ones,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
because I've seen different
ones, different types.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:84%
But I think that even
the type that I've seen,

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are
more than one group.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.459 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Describe
what they look like.

00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Well, the
one in particular

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:10%
when I first saw those,
they took animal-like.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:90%
They don't look anything like--

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
walking on two feet?

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:10%
They're on two feet,
but they are thin.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:10%
They're not real big and bulky.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Muscular.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: No.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:10%
No, they're muscular,
but they're thin.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Thin.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like they work out.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.454 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Like they
work out on steroids.

00:14:53.454 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Very muscular.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Smaller than you would expect.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
The darker ones, which are the
type that we have, the more

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:90%
animal type, are smaller.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.694 align:middle line:84%
They're probably between
seven to eight feet tall,

00:15:08.694 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:84%
which I consider smaller
compared to the other ones.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty good size.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: But they
are still good size.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean there
are bigger ones than that?

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yes.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:90%
There are bigger ones.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But the one-- I
used to watch him

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.010 align:middle line:90%
through the night vision scope.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.505 align:middle line:84%
I would go upstairs and watch
him from our bedroom window,

00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and I would watch to
see what they were doing

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:90%
and keep an eye on them.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you ever scared?

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: God, yes.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:34.780 align:middle line:10%
Not scared-- terrified to
where you can't breathe.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:84%
The first time I saw
them, I couldn't breathe.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But they
never demonstrated

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.740 align:middle line:10%
anything that would show
that they would harm you.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.410 align:middle line:10%
Did they?

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Well, just
looking at them,

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and my husband was
hit with a car.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:84%
They tried to hit
him in the car.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that they
approached the house,

00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I saw things that
they did in the forest

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
with-- I didn't write
that in the book.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Some stuff I didn't
write, because I

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to tell that part.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they do?

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Well, they're animals.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, they're going
to hurt other animals.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:90%
It's just dumb.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
caught something?

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: They-- I saw them one
time when I was watching them,

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and they had a little
fawn, a little deer.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And tore it apart.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: It was
just-- it was weird,

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.410 align:middle line:10%
because the little deer
wasn't running from them.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:90%
They were playing with it.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:84%
They weren't-- it wasn't like,
let me kill it and rip it

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:90%
and eat it.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And eat it.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: No.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:10%
It was more like they surrounded
it, and it had nowhere to go.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:10%
And they kind of pet it,
you know like between them.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.929 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They played with
it, and then they killed it?

00:16:57.929 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: And it was
the way they killed it

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:10%
that was really strange, because
it was like the little deer was

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:10%
moving.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:84%
You know a little deer-
you could see it moving.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:90%
You could see its little ears.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.749 align:middle line:84%
You know, its little
ears were flopping,

00:17:08.749 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:90%
and you could see that a little.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.859 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You seem
upset about this.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Yeah, I
don't like that part,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, that one,
because he was so cute.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:84%
And there was
nothing you could do.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:84%
We'd watch, and there's
nothing you could do.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was the way they did it.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.520 align:middle line:84%
They-- it was like the
little deer was moving,

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.894 align:middle line:84%
and he was standing
like on upright.

00:17:36.894 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
it looked like one of them

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
put their hand underneath
it, and they just, I

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:84%
think, say snapped its
neck or snapped it.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And then it wasn't
moving anymore.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.619 align:middle line:90%
It just-- but it didn't fall.

00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:90%
It didn't hit the ground.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.010 align:middle line:84%
It didn't collapse,
and it didn't fall.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.670 align:middle line:90%
It was like animated.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:90%
It's still in the position.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think they ate it?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: I didn't
see them eat it.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see them eat it.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.040 align:middle line:84%
All I saw of them
was play with it,

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:90%
and then I saw them kill it.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when they
came up to your house--

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to really tell us
this story-- what did you see?

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Well, there's
been a few incidents where

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:90%
they come to the house, OK?

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And on one incident
in particular-- well,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:84%
one incident, they tried
to turn the door knob.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like they wanted in?

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:32.850 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Yeah, they
were trying to get--

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.670 align:middle line:10%
they've tried to get in twice.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:10%
Two times they've tried
to enter the house.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Thank God they
don't break windows, huh?

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: I don't know why.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.620 align:middle line:84%
I write in the
book, why don't they

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:90%
pull-- come through the doors?

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
But the first time was
when they were in the pool,

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:90%
and we had gone out there.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.769 align:middle line:90%
It was late at night.

00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:84%
We had let the dogs out,
because the dogs always go out

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:84%
during the night, which
we don't do anymore.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.202 align:middle line:84%
But we had let the dogs out,
and I went to get the dogs back

00:19:00.202 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:84%
in, because we thought
as long as we left

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.369 align:middle line:84%
the French doors
open, the curtains,

00:19:04.369 --> 00:19:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and we were there
with them that they

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't hurt the dogs, because
they kept approaching the dogs.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.026 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
the dogs were out.

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And we tried not
to let them out,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:90%
but they just wanted to get out.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was bringing the dogs in,
and I noticed there was water

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:90%
all around the pool.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.530 align:middle line:90%
We have a swimming pool.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Just massive amounts of
water, and then footprints.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.941 align:middle line:84%
And they go-- if you got
out of the swimming pool,

00:19:27.941 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
you would only make footprints
for maybe, I would say,

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:90%
five to 10 feet.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:84%
We're talking 40
feet-plus of footprints.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:84%
We're talking massive amounts
of water and footprints.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're like a sponge.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: I mean literally.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed it, and I
told my husband-- I said,

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:90%
did the dogs fall in the pool?

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So we checked the
dogs, and I told him,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.802 align:middle line:90%
you've got to see this.

00:19:51.802 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So they
were in your pool?

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Oh, yeah.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.110 align:middle line:10%
They drink, and they
go in there and-- well,

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:10%
that one was in the pool.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:10%
And we went outside,
and I photographed

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:10%
all the footprints.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.823 align:middle line:84%
I have all the photos,
because I photograph.

00:20:02.823 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:84%
If I see something,
I photograph it.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:84%
We photographed the footprints,
and we come back in the house,

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.281 align:middle line:84%
and my husband-- I was upset,
because this was the first time

00:20:11.281 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:90%
that they had gotten in there.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And we knew they were getting
in the side area, you know,

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:90%
side pool area.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:90%
I was very upset.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.855 align:middle line:90%
And so we watched a show.

00:20:19.855 --> 00:20:22.760 align:middle line:84%
It was probably-- it was coming
upon 3 o'clock in the morning,

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.593 align:middle line:84%
because we were out
there taking footprints.

00:20:24.593 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 1:52 AM, and we
took the footprints, pictures.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.200 align:middle line:90%
I could tell by the pictures.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.995 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't focus on that.

00:20:31.995 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't wait till morning,
because what I wanted to do

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:10%
was I wanted to call
the investigator,

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:10%
and I wanted to send
him the pictures,

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:10%
because I wanted to know
what was in our pool.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And I had an idea of what
was in the pool, obviously,

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:90%
but I wanted an expert.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know for a fact
that what these footprints were,

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.791 align:middle line:84%
because they don't look
like what you would assume--

00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
you know, like you-- because
I photographed some of it

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:90%
in the snow.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:84%
I have a footprint in the snow,
but the footprints in the pool

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:90%
look different.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:84%
They look different,
because I guess the water

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:90%
runoff and the way they step.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big were the feet?

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.345 align:middle line:90%
Like this?

00:21:06.345 --> 00:21:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah, 16 inches.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.319 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
some little ones too.

00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know if
they were fading off,

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:90%
and they just looked little.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.025 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if-- it's water.

00:21:17.025 --> 00:21:18.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I want to listen
to some more sounds

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:10%
here, Christine.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:10%
We would.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.320 align:middle line:10%
We've got more howls.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.455 align:middle line:10%
We've got mimicking sounds.

00:21:24.455 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's listen to the--

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Oh, yeah,
the Mommy one too.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's listen
to the next three.

00:21:28.435 --> 00:21:31.900 align:middle line:90%
[MUFFLED SOUNDS]

00:21:31.900 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Strange sounds.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my god, what are they?

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: I don't know.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Some of the sounds I let
the investigator listen to,

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:90%
and he identifies them.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And when he identifies
them and tells me

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.890 align:middle line:84%
this is the reason why
we identify it as such--

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
because he's been
investigating for 25 years--

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.194 align:middle line:84%
then I know, OK,
that's what it was.

00:22:30.194 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a bird--

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:32.068 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Some of them.

00:22:32.068 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:10%
Some of them, he--
we hear them coming.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, before
the audio records,

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:90%
we hear the bushes moving.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:90%
We hear the breaking.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.160 align:middle line:90%
You can hear them.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.530 align:middle line:84%
They're not-- sometimes
they're not quiet.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:50.780 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they are quiet.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
But they were-- you can hear
them approaching the house.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.724 align:middle line:84%
You could hear
the bushes moving.

00:22:54.724 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:84%
You could hear the--
you just can hear it.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.586 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
their faces look like?

00:22:59.586 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: They
look like animals.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:10%
I look at the gorilla,
and it's similar, similar.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.420 align:middle line:10%
But there's differences.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:10%
The dog--

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it
dark, dark pigment?

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.871 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or is it all hair?

00:23:10.871 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: On the
face, on the mouth,

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.580 align:middle line:90%
it's just pigment on this part.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:10%
But their nose--

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it dark
pigment, or is it white?

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:10%
What color is it?

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: I looked through the
night vision scope on the face.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Only one did I see
from the neck down

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.012 align:middle line:84%
like the body, the
color, the everything.

00:23:29.012 --> 00:23:30.720 align:middle line:84%
The rest of them I
see through the scope,

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:90%
through the night vision scope.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.480 align:middle line:90%
And you can't determine--

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: So I can't determine
color, other than they're dark,

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:37.960 align:middle line:90%
because that's what I see.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I see the black one,
the black black.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like an ape would be.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.780 align:middle line:84%
The facial features
is the brows up here.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Their brows are protruding,
so their eyes look recessed,

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:90%
but their eyes are very big.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.737 align:middle line:84%
The snout on them are
the nose, and well, we're

00:23:54.737 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:90%
talking about Bigfoot, so.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.836 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they look
more animal than human.

00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Absolutely.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Nothing human.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:84%
The nose, the snout comes out
like this comes out, protrudes.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Like a dog?

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.190 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Similar, but
the nose is at the tip.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:10%
It's at the end.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.672 align:middle line:10%
It's not like the
nose comes down.

00:24:12.672 --> 00:24:14.130 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how
ape-- I don't know

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:10%
if their nose goes this way.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when you
look at the snout of a dog,

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.020 align:middle line:84%
the nose is right out
there on the tip, right?

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.353 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah, it's on the tip.

00:24:20.353 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:84%
It comes to the end of the
mouth, the end of the snout.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.480 align:middle line:84%
That's what I found strange
was that the shape comes down,

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:90%
and it comes to the end.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you'd have
the brow out here,

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.257 align:middle line:84%
and then the nose comes out
with the mouth like that.

00:24:34.257 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Well, the
mouth doesn't come down.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't curve down.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't curve.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a solid like flat here.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It goes up
and down like our jaws.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Mm-hm.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they're about seven
to eight feet tall you say.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.500 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Them were, that kind.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.451 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes you think
that they could be dangerous?

00:24:51.451 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Oh, I know
they're dangerous.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To people?

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: I know they
can be dangerous.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:55.994 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they ever
attacked you or your family?

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: They have.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.110 align:middle line:84%
They hit my husband while he
was driving down the street.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean they hit him?

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.395 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: They hit the car.

00:25:03.395 --> 00:25:04.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: With what?

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.784 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Theirselves
or their hands.

00:25:06.784 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:84%
They hit it just
enough so that it

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.450 align:middle line:84%
would fishtail so
that he would get out

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:90%
to see what hit the car.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then they'd
grab him or something.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: That's what I believe.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:15.590 align:middle line:90%
I believe that.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But haven't they had
opportunities, Christine, now

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.475 align:middle line:90%
to grab you and your family?

00:25:19.475 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:84%
This has been going
on for three years.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: They haven't had
opportunities to grab me.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
They haven't had the
opportunity to grab me.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they
come up to the house?

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: They have.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.270 align:middle line:90%
They've banged on the door.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.590 align:middle line:90%
They've tried to open the door.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They bang on the door.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Oh, yeah.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.482 align:middle line:10%
One night one was
banging on the door.

00:25:33.482 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, as
a matter of fact,

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.210 align:middle line:10%
we have some sounds of what
could be Bigfoot knocking.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.690 align:middle line:10%
Let's listen in on that.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:90%
[MUFFLED KNOCKS]

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:56.100 align:middle line:90%


00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.220 align:middle line:10%
How do you know that
was a Bigfoot knocking?

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.590 align:middle line:10%
I mean did you peek
out and see them?

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: No.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.310 align:middle line:84%
We have recorded
knocking before, OK?

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:09.800 align:middle line:10%
And the first time I
recorded them knocking,

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:10%
it puts you back, because--

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You don't
want to go to the door.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Well,
you don't hear it.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.990 align:middle line:10%
You don't hear it.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:10%
It records, but yet
you don't hear it.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:10%
I didn't hear it.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.510 align:middle line:10%
You don't hear that.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.104 align:middle line:10%
It just records.

00:26:24.104 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:10%
You could hear it on
the audio recorder,

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:10%
which is by the front door.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But you can't hear the
physical, [KNOCKS], knocking.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: You don't hear
the physical knocking,

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:10%
so the first time it
occurred, I always listen.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:10%
When I post sounds
or I save the sounds,

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:10%
I always listen
for something else.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:90%
It can't just be a knocking.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:45.400 align:middle line:84%
It can't just be them
crawling up to the house,

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.202 align:middle line:90%
and you can create those sounds.

00:26:47.202 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Those are just sounds
that anybody hears.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.820 align:middle line:84%
You can hear anything,
so they're no good to me.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:84%
If it's crawling
up the house, if it

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.290 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make a vocal sound,
then you don't know what it is.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's just knocking.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.612 align:middle line:84%
In that particular audio,
that's the second time

00:27:04.612 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:90%
or the third time it knocked.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.210 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the second time.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:90%
It knocked.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:90%
But then you listen.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:90%
You can hear it mumbling.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.000 align:middle line:90%
They go, [SLURPING SOUNDS].

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:90%
That's how they talk.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Wookies.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Mm-hm.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.120 align:middle line:10%
You hear it.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.920 align:middle line:10%
They knock.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:10%
And you know it's them.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, oh, my god.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.340 align:middle line:90%
It's them knocking.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:35.030 align:middle line:84%
But unless you hear them
or hear a sound afterwards,

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.515 align:middle line:84%
you have to just-- I have a
lot that we had to discount,

00:27:37.515 --> 00:27:39.390 align:middle line:84%
where we'd listen to
stuff, and we were like,

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.200 align:middle line:84%
oh, my-- you got
to be kidding me.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:84%
But it can be-- it
doesn't have any vocals.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:50.805 align:middle line:84%
So without having a vocal,
even though I could say,

00:27:50.805 --> 00:27:52.930 align:middle line:84%
yeah, this is what happened,
and yeah, we heard it,

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.574 align:middle line:84%
and this is what--
you don't have it.

00:27:55.574 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they thrown
rocks at your house?

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I've heard stories
about things like that.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.020 align:middle line:90%
They don't throw big rocks.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.524 align:middle line:90%
They throw pebbles.

00:28:03.524 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:84%
They have been
pebbling our house.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.615 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Just like [INAUDIBLE]--
like they're having fun.

00:28:06.615 --> 00:28:08.170 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Like pap, pap.

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:12.245 align:middle line:10%
Well, there are certain
sounds they make, OK?

00:28:12.245 --> 00:28:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I learned the
sounds of the neighbor, when

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I started to listen, and I
listened to audio for hours,

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and I started to
distinguish the neighborhood

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:84%
sounds from the sounds
of them, because I

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.402 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know exactly
when they got there.

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know exactly--
I used to watch them night

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.990 align:middle line:84%
after night, and I wanted
to know when they came.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I would listen
to the neighborhood,

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and then I would identify
the neighborhood sounds

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.864 align:middle line:84%
like this sound is
a car, this sound

00:28:34.864 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:84%
is this, this sound
is that, because you

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:40.750 align:middle line:90%
have to do it many times.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.990 align:middle line:84%
When they would start, they
have their certain sounds

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
when they're there, and
pebbles is one of them.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:47.850 align:middle line:90%
You will hear pebbles.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to look
at another video of what

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.720 align:middle line:90%
could be a ghostly apparition.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Explain for us what this is.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:10%
So what are we looking
at here, Christine?

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.240 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: This is my mailbox,
and that's the pathway.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.041 align:middle line:10%
That's the forest.

00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:02.540 align:middle line:10%
That's what I was
telling you about.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.600 align:middle line:10%
This is our front yard.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
This is our driveway and
mailbox, the pathway,

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and then the forest
on both sides.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.210 align:middle line:84%
This particular night,
there was a lot of activity.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.700 align:middle line:84%
You see all the stuff
blowing debris, whatever?

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that what that is?

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: That's going around.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.320 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.180 align:middle line:10%
And so what I did was I just
started to run a footage,

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.100 align:middle line:10%
started to film it with my
tripod and the camera because

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.190 align:middle line:10%
of all the activity.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:90%
And I picked up that.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I always
try to snapshot it.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.046 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
daytime or same thing?

00:29:37.046 --> 00:29:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: This is at night.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the same one.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.550 align:middle line:90%
This is what you just saw.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:90%
This is the same.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.200 align:middle line:90%
This is the video.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.980 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Some nights there's
a lot of activity.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.556 align:middle line:84%
One night reported
a mist showing up,

00:29:53.556 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:90%
and it blocked the cameras.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.096 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
what do you think--

00:29:56.096 --> 00:29:58.880 align:middle line:84%
or do you think they're
physical or dimensional?

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.400 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: In the beginning,
we thought-- in the beginning,

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.990 align:middle line:10%
we were so naive.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.120 align:middle line:10%
We thought they were
what we had heard

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.560 align:middle line:10%
on TV, that they were just
the missing link, so to speak,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:10%
or apes.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But after three years of
dealing with these things

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with all the
stuff that we have seen,

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:18.600 align:middle line:90%
recorded and stuff.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.928 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
wish they'd go away?

00:30:20.928 --> 00:30:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Mm-hm.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.250 align:middle line:90%
I wish-- that's the problem.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.922 align:middle line:90%
You have them.

00:30:27.922 --> 00:30:31.280 align:middle line:84%
They come out and
investigate them.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Creates more problems, because
now they know that you know.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Now you're in bigger
trouble, so to speak,

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.180 align:middle line:90%
and no one can help you.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you
think they're smart?

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.930 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Very.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:46.790 align:middle line:90%
No one can remove them.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.750 align:middle line:90%
No one can help you.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:90%
You're on your own.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:53.714 align:middle line:84%
And if you live across
the street from them,

00:30:53.714 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:90%
you're in big trouble.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:55.902 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you shoot one?

00:30:55.902 --> 00:30:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: If it came
into the house, yes.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.068 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it came
into the house.

00:30:59.068 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: We are
armed definitely.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I would not go out there
and hunt one and shoot one.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I would not even
want to, because I'm

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:10.950 align:middle line:84%
going to tell you right now, you
shoot one, you won't survive.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
You may get one, but
you will not survive.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.940 align:middle line:90%
You won't survive.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.680 align:middle line:90%
You better leave fast.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've compiled these
stories into three books.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.250 align:middle line:90%
This is "100 Bigfoot Nights."

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.632 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
these creatures are?

00:31:30.632 --> 00:31:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: I don't know.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
extraterrestrials?

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Are they beings that
have been dropped

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.060 align:middle line:90%
down here from another planet?

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.080 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Well, let me
tell you a story, OK?

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I have lots
of them, obviously.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But things got stranger and
stranger as time went by.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.600 align:middle line:84%
If you started out
with this, and then

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.240 align:middle line:84%
it started-- well, for
instance, the one that was

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:90%
banging on the door that night.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
on the cameras.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.735 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:57.735 --> 00:31:59.460 align:middle line:90%
It didn't cross the cameras.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.960 align:middle line:84%
We have cameras going this
way, this way at the time.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.889 align:middle line:90%
Now we have way more.

00:32:02.889 --> 00:32:04.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Almost like
a dimensional feeling?

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Mm-hm.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And then when we get
to the paranormal part,

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.170 align:middle line:84%
there is one paranormal
incident that bothers me,

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and it still bothers
me to this day.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.370 align:middle line:84%
They all bother me, but
this one in particular.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:84%
It was when I heard
it arrive, and I

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.490 align:middle line:84%
heard it walking in
the second-- I thought

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:90%
it was in my son's room.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:26.820 align:middle line:90%
I could hear it.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I could hear it arrive, and
I could hear it walking.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up
determining that it

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.849 align:middle line:84%
was an entity-- we'd like
to think it was an entity,

00:32:36.849 --> 00:32:38.890 align:middle line:84%
but it bothers me because
the way that it arrived

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:40.015 align:middle line:90%
and the way that it walked.

00:32:40.015 --> 00:32:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think
it was a physical feeling?

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: To me, it sounded
physical because of the way

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.710 align:middle line:84%
it walked, because I could hear
it, and it was-- it felt heavy.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could
hear the thump.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.574 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: I could
hear it arrive.

00:32:51.574 --> 00:32:53.007 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I
heard it arrive,

00:32:53.007 --> 00:32:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it was a preacher
going on the roof again,

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:90%
you know, the front porch.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I told my husband, well, there's
one of the front porch again.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Just let it be.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.660 align:middle line:84%
He was going to go
out there with a gun.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It wasn't Santa
and his reindeer either.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:02.660 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: Mm-mm.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.050 align:middle line:10%
But you know, they
on the front porch,

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:05.310 align:middle line:10%
and they go up to
the higher levels.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:06.640 align:middle line:10%
You can't see them, and
then you come back down.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, well,
it's just one of them.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.061 align:middle line:84%
I told my husband,
just let it be.

00:33:10.061 --> 00:33:12.560 align:middle line:84%
As long as they're not trying
to get into the house anymore.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
was going to say,

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Christine, you do know if
they wanted to attack you,

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.040 align:middle line:84%
they could have done
this by now easily.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Mm-hm.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
seem to be doing that.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.111 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: They could
have killed us easily.

00:33:22.111 --> 00:33:24.254 align:middle line:84%
I mean we could have
disappeared one night easily.

00:33:24.254 --> 00:33:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
gone out into the woods

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.800 align:middle line:90%
and saw them out in the woods?

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Mm-mm.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why won't you do that?

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:30.995 align:middle line:90%
You're afraid?

00:33:30.995 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Mm-hm.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.290 align:middle line:90%
I won't do it.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.370 align:middle line:90%
My son did.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:84%
My son has been eye to
eye with them twice.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Darrell from Texas
writes, why haven't you moved?

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.835 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: I'm trying.

00:33:39.835 --> 00:33:41.459 align:middle line:84%
Tell him my house is
for sale, Darrell.

00:33:41.459 --> 00:33:42.402 align:middle line:90%
You want to buy it?

00:33:42.402 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you going to
disclose what's going on?

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: OK.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.360 align:middle line:84%
We had a big fight over
this, me and my husband.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Not a big fight, but
I think we should.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.280 align:middle line:84%
He says no way, because he said
we will never sell the house.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.510 align:middle line:84%
We need to get out of our house,
and we would never sell it.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Legally, I don't
have to disclose it.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.448 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not in Arkansas.

00:34:07.448 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Mm-mm.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Philadelphia,
if there are ghosts,

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:10.780 align:middle line:90%
you've got to disclose that.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.219 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:12.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in some
states you have to.

00:34:12.885 --> 00:34:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Some states you do,
but in my state, you don't.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I guess there's
no disclosure for, we're

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:20.570 align:middle line:90%
being stalked by Bigfoot.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: To try and tell
people that would be-- we

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:90%
would never leave.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.576 align:middle line:90%
You would never sell our house.

00:34:28.576 --> 00:34:29.909 align:middle line:90%
We would never get out of there.

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's difficult to
sell the house now and hide it

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.520 align:middle line:90%
with your books out.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.909 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Well, you have to
think at the time, when this

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:41.389 align:middle line:84%
started happening
to us, I didn't

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:44.110 align:middle line:84%
think we'd survive to
tell you the truth.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think that we would
live long enough for anybody

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.311 align:middle line:90%
to know what would happen to us.

00:34:51.311 --> 00:34:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Christine,
in your series of books--

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and you have three
of them out there--

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.190 align:middle line:84%
what are you trying to
convey to the people?

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.490 align:middle line:90%
What do you want them to know?

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:02.056 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: I want them to
know to not do what we did.

00:35:02.056 --> 00:35:02.972 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that was?

00:35:02.972 --> 00:35:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: That was be that naive
and mess with these things.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Do not do what we did.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.180 align:middle line:90%
We did everything wrong.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.305 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What would you do?

00:35:13.305 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Ignore them?

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: I wouldn't
ignore them,

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:19.200 align:middle line:84%
but I wouldn't chase
them, and I wouldn't

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:90%
take photographs of them.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.380 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't try to bait them, and
I wouldn't do an investigation

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.180 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think what you
did was brilliant myself.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean to document the
possibility of Bigfoot

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.790 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's got to do this.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:35.422 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: I know, but I
didn't want it to be me.

00:35:35.422 --> 00:35:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I would rather it
be somebody else.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unfortunately,
it was you.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.620 align:middle line:90%
It was your house.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:41.690 align:middle line:90%
It had to be done.

00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.970 align:middle line:84%
It had to be,
because at the time,

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I thought that we
wouldn't survive.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.480 align:middle line:90%
I really did.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I really thought that
we would disappear.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could
kill you at some time.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Not only them,
but I thought there

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:90%
was a cover-up too involved.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are you comfortable
with them out there?

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:10%
>>PARKER: No.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:57.670 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.730 align:middle line:10%
Never will be, never.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Never, no.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.140 align:middle line:84%

that if you saw one and waved,

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.090 align:middle line:90%
they would wave back?

They have their own agenda.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Whatever that is, I don't know.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:84%
But you're just a
means to an end.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're pretty well
convinced that they're animals.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: No.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: No.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:22.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they are.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
in the beginning.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.986 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: In the beginning--
well, in the beginning,

00:36:25.986 --> 00:36:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm only going off what I
learned, what I see on TV.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were just-- that
you could capture them and put

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.740 align:middle line:84%
them in a cage and put them in
a-- you know, like an animal.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.060 align:middle line:90%
That's not what they are.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patty from
Maine wants to know

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:45.110 align:middle line:84%
if you've seen a pattern with
them, anything you can predict.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: No.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:49.650 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that I did--
when I write the books,

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing them,
and I'm living it.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm going through it,
I don't notice any patterns

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.780 align:middle line:90%
until I get done.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back, and you
read it, and then I see things.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.130 align:middle line:90%
I say, oh, my god.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:90%
This is why.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.740 align:middle line:90%
This is why.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.500 align:middle line:84%
As far as patterns
with them, no.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I do notice that they'll
mess with us like they'll

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.830 align:middle line:84%
do something really, really
bad or horrific to really get

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:17.490 align:middle line:84%
us worked up and upset like
try to get into the house,

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and then it'll be like they're
not there for three weeks.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.250 align:middle line:90%
It'll look vacant.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.310 align:middle line:90%
It'll be calm, quiet.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean gone.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And just when you
think, oh, they're gone.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.590 align:middle line:84%
They moved on, or
you know, you're not

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.346 align:middle line:84%
going to have any problems
anymore, next thing you know,

00:37:33.346 --> 00:37:34.300 align:middle line:90%
bam.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:90%
They're there again.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And they do things that--
I try to warn people,

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.530 align:middle line:84%
if you hear someone calling you
at night, calling your name,

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:48.260 align:middle line:84%
or you hear a family
member calling you

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.500 align:middle line:84%
from a bush or a forest or
like in my son's case, the side

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:90%
of the driveway, it's not them.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.720 align:middle line:84%
They can mimic
voices and sounds,

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and they can sound just like
someone you know calling you.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.724 align:middle line:90%
Also, if you hear a child--

00:38:06.724 --> 00:38:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They sound
like that too?

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Oh, yeah.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.299 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a kid
screaming in the wind.

00:38:10.299 --> 00:38:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: It's the male Bigfoot
that has that vocal range.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.820 align:middle line:84%
They sound like that,
and like the ones

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.090 align:middle line:84%
you played where they
were calling Mommy,

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.424 align:middle line:90%
the one did that for six months.

00:38:20.424 --> 00:38:21.673 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're like parrots.

00:38:21.673 --> 00:38:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: He kept calling,
Mommy, Mommy, come here.

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Find me.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.479 align:middle line:84%
He kept doing anything
he could to try

00:38:26.479 --> 00:38:27.520 align:middle line:90%
to get you to go outside.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.080 align:middle line:90%
They want you to come look.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.330 align:middle line:84%
They want you to think, oh,
poor little kids out there.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.420 align:middle line:84%
We heard it twice
crying from the forest

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:90%
like a child, a baby crying.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking at the
monitor, and you're thinking,

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.590 align:middle line:90%
it's--

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It can't be, yeah.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: --1 o'clock
in the morning.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.650 align:middle line:84%
There ain't no baby
in that forest.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:44.867 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's hope not.

00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: But it's crying.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:47.940 align:middle line:90%
It's going, wah, wah.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:55.850 align:middle line:84%
They do things, the most bizarre
things, to try to trick you.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And with us, it's
trial and error.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:90%
We learned by trial and error.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:90%
We learned by going through it.

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:08.300 align:middle line:84%
We learned by being hit by
it, then going through it,

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.330 align:middle line:84%
realizing it, and
then trying to adjust.

to see one up and personal?

desire to see this.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.780 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them
through the scope.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.420 align:middle line:84%
My son has seen him
up and personal.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.027 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's
close enough for you.

00:39:24.027 --> 00:39:24.860 align:middle line:90%

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Never.

Your website?

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>PARKER: Yeah.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:33.072 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I have a website, which
is 100bigfootnights.com.

00:39:33.072 --> 00:39:34.380 align:middle line:10%

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PARKER: Dot-com, uh-huh,
the same as the book series.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And on the website, they
can listen to the sounds.

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:90%
They can watch the videos.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
to buy the books.

more, and you want

Foxy's barking at it

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.830 align:middle line:10%
or why that thing said,
"embar," when it says, "embar."

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you know, those things--
that's what the books are for.
