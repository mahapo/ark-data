00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.909 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.155 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.512 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief".

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps one of the
most important programs

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:10%
you've ever heard on vaccines.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:10%
With me, Dr. Sherri
Tenpenny, of course.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:10%
She is a noted author
and researcher.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:10%
Heads up her own clinic in the
Cleveland, Ohio area as well.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.619 align:middle line:90%
This is big stuff, isn't it?

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SHERRI TENPENNY: It is.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:10%
It's become the topic
of the day for parents.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.660 align:middle line:10%
And it's actually
becoming more contentious

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:10%
because when you talk about
vaccines it becomes polarized.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.740 align:middle line:10%
You're either for or
against, pro or con.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The regular flu,
36,000 people die in the United

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:10%
States--

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.411 align:middle line:10%
>>TENPENNY: That's a lie.

00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Every year
from the "regular" flu.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:10%
Yet, when we hear stories
of the SARS, or H1N1,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:10%
or whatever it is, they talk
about two or three people

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:10%
have died.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:90%
But it could be a pandemic.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand this, Sherri.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:84%
How can they talk about
one or two isolated cases

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and talk about it as
a pandemic when you've

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:84%
got 36,000 people dying just
in the United States alone

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.432 align:middle line:90%
from the normal, regular flu?

00:01:34.432 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:10%
>>TENPENNY: You know what's
interesting about that, George,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:10%
is about four years ago there
were several of us who plowed

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:10%
through a bunch of data that
actually came from the American

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:10%
Lung Association.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:10%
Then when you actually broke it
down, that whole, often quoted,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:10%
statistic of 36,000
deaths per year

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:10%
that you would hear 50 times
a week on the 6:00 news

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:10%
was a lie.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:10%
There really are not
36,000 people a year

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:10%
that die from the flu.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.737 align:middle line:10%
Actually, there are
less than 1,000.

00:02:02.737 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What?

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:10%
>>TENPENNY: Probably about 800.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Where do we
get these numbers?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.499 align:middle line:10%
>>TENPENNY: It comes from
the elderly people who

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.090 align:middle line:10%
are dying from pneumonia
that may or may not

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:10%
be a complication of the flu.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And that number is
really incorrect.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you'll notice, when we
brought this out in the media--

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.556 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I think we talked
about it on your show on "Coast

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
to Coast"-- is that, since that
time, in the last three years,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.711 align:middle line:84%
they don't use that number
anymore because they've been

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:90%
called out.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And so this whole issue of
pandemic, pandemic, pandemic--

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:90%
remember we had bird flu?

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.990 align:middle line:90%
And then we had swine flu?

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And now, who knows, maybe
we'll have bunny flu--

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And still, no pandemic.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: And
still no pandemic.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:84%
They are constantly
thinking, sooner or later,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be the virus
that's going to be the big one.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that I could
say that there might be some

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:84%
validity to that is that because
we have so over-vaccinated

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.410 align:middle line:84%
children and adults these days
we have weakened their immune

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
system, that there
may come a day,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
somewhere out in the
future, that some little,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:90%
garden variety of virus--

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will pop up.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Is going to come
along and cause a problem.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's
particularly true when

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
the virus is combined
with chemicals.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.042 align:middle line:84%
There was reports
that I dug out,

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
with one of the books
that I was writing,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that talked about the
combination of the influenza

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
virus and dioxin actually
doubled the death

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:90%
rate in all of the mice.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So when you get all of these
chemical contaminants--

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mixed in.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: The pesticides,
the genetically modified food,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and all of these things, that
we've weakened the human genome

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
to the effect that
perhaps in some day

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
there may be some garden
variety influenza that

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
comes around and
wipes us all out.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do we
do with newborns?

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Newborns are born.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.340 align:middle line:90%
We vaccinate them.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.352 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well,
unfortunately, we

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:84%
used to always think
that the baby in the womb

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:90%
was protected by the placenta.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
That it was somehow
a shield against

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.352 align:middle line:90%
environmental toxicities.

00:03:50.352 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Environmental Working
Group came out with a study

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:84%
about, it's been probably
eight or 10 years ago now,

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that they actually tested
cord blood from the infant

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.230 align:middle line:84%
at the time of birth and found
that the children were actually

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
exposed to more than 230
different types of chemicals

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:90%
in utero.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And now we're talking about
vaccinating pregnant women

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.781 align:middle line:84%
with flu shots,
pertussis vaccines.

00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I've even read a
report that they're

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
considering Gardasil
vaccines for cervical cancer

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:90%
to be given to pregnant women.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.829 align:middle line:84%
So those babies are
going to be exposed

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:90%
to those toxins in utero.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Now as soon as they're born,
as soon as the baby comes

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:84%
through the birth canal--
or through c-section--

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:84%
comes through the birth canal,
within 48 hours after birth,

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
we give them a
vitamin K shot, which

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
has benzyl alcohol
in it, which is

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
hard on their liver who
is not ready for that.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And we give them a Hepatitis
B vaccine at birth.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
The Hepatitis B vaccine is the
most neurogenic, most toxic

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
vaccine, in my opinion,
that they've made yet.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we give this
to children at birth.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Now when they decided to do
that-- that was in 1991 when

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:84%
they started giving the
Hepatitis B vaccine in birth--

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
the reason for that, which
is just ludicrous to me,

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:84%
is that they were
having an outbreak

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:84%
of Hepatitis B in
Southeast Asia.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:84%
That Hepatitis B was endemic in
the Southeast Asia population.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And so because of
that, we needed

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.460 align:middle line:84%
to give Hepatitis B to
newborns in our country.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.909 align:middle line:84%
The vaccine was never tested
on newborns or children

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.200 align:middle line:90%
when they brought it to market.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:84%
It had only been tested on
five and 10-year-old children.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So we now are damaging
children at birth.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And at that point in time--
that vaccine came out in 1991--

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.510 align:middle line:84%
the Hib vaccine
came out in 1991.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And the chart graphs of
the incidence of autism

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.529 align:middle line:84%
just went off the roof
starting at that point.

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We'll talk
about that in a second.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to look at
this video with regards

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.507 align:middle line:90%
to vaccines and newborns.

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: What we do
to these newborns is,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.840 align:middle line:84%
within minutes of birth,
they're exposed to latex.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:84%
They're exposed to vitamin K
shots, a vitamin K shot that

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is given almost
immediately after birth,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:84%
on the outside chance that a
very rare blood disorder might

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.985 align:middle line:90%
be happening in this baby.

00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:84%
It has nine milligrams
of benzyl alcohol.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And there have been reports,
in the pediatric literature,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.110 align:middle line:84%
particularly the Canadian
pediatric literature, that

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
thinks that it's that vitamin
K shot that's given right

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
at birth that leads these
children, many of them,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.120 align:middle line:84%
down the pathway into
jaundice and they

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:84%
have kernicterus and all
these different problems.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Because their liver
is not meant to handle

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
that big dose of alcohol
as soon as they're born.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you
tell people this,

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
what has been their
reaction to this?

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do they panic?

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Do they say, I'm not
going to get a vaccine?

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.991 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: That's
a great question.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's a wide response angle.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
When I first started doing
this, back in September of 2000,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:84%
when I first started
investigating

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:84%
the problems associated
with vaccines,

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and I did my first
talk in 2001, at first,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
there was just a
handful of us that

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:84%
are bringing out all
of these problems.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And over time, over
the last 10, 12 years,

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
it has become-- it's gone from
a drip, drip, to a drizzle,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.756 align:middle line:84%
to a onslaught, like
a downpour, of people

00:07:09.756 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
who are now
questioning vaccines.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was a big
study that just came out,

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
probably within the last year,
that they did a huge survey

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:84%
across the country and they
found that 89% of parents

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.105 align:middle line:90%
are now questioning vaccines.

00:07:22.105 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.771 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: They're
questioning the safety.

00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:26.287 align:middle line:84%
They're questioning
do they work.

00:07:26.287 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:84%
They're questioning why
do we have to get so many.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And why do we have to get
them all at the same time.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's something other
than this that we can do.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, the response
has really changed.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And people are now
really questioning.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I believe that we
are reaching that critical mass

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
that if parents don't
question vaccines,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
that is what should be called
child abuse and neglect, not

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:84%
the parents who have
investigated and agonized

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
over their decision
and decided I am not

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:90%
going to inject my children.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Where the Children's
Services can say,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:90%
well, then you're a bad parent.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Or the court says you're a
bad parent, like if there's

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:90%
a divorce case that's going on.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.700 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're reaching
the point of parents

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:90%
are saying, no more.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:90%
We've had enough.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sherri, you cannot go
to a drugstore without seeing

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:10%
a big sign up there that says
flu shots available here--

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:10%
>>TENPENNY: Today.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: From this
time to this time.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.290 align:middle line:10%
They're really pushing
flu vaccines, aren't they?

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:10%
>>TENPENNY: They absolutely are.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:10%
For some reason, the government
and the pharmaceutical industry

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.850 align:middle line:10%
and the medical industry
want every single person

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:10%
injected with this flu vaccine.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.224 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what the--

00:08:37.224 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what flu is it?

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Reason is for that.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's the three
viruses that they

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:84%
pick from Southeast
Asia last year.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:90%
So they pick these viruses.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.616 align:middle line:84%
And then they say that
these are the ones

00:08:47.616 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that we suspect are
going to be the ones that

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.750 align:middle line:84%
are going to cause
influenza this year.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The CDC says that you
have to get a vaccine that

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.270 align:middle line:84%
matches the one that's in the
environment for it to work.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But what people
don't really know

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.640 align:middle line:84%
is that when they select
those three viruses to go

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:84%
into the vaccine, those viruses
don't always grow well in eggs.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So they have to mix them
with other viruses that

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.067 align:middle line:90%
do grow well in eggs.

00:09:10.067 --> 00:09:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So they're not going
to match the one that's

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.780 align:middle line:90%
in circulation anyway.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So they find the ones
that grow well in eggs.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:90%
They inoculate these eggs.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:10%
They pick the little
shell off the top.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:10%
And they inject these
viruses in there.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.167 align:middle line:90%
11 days later--

00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are these chicken eggs?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Chicken eggs.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And the chickens
actually have embryos

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.050 align:middle line:90%
that are growing in them.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
to have the protein

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that's in there for
the virus to replicate.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So they put the
viruses in this egg.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.490 align:middle line:84%
They put the eggs
in an incubator.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
11 days later,
they suck out what

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:84%
would be the egg white that
has the virus growing in it.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
centrifuge this slurry

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:84%
because it contains chicken
blood, chicken proteins, avian

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.940 align:middle line:84%
viruses, stray
viruses that we now

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
know have been associated
with breast cancer.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And all of those
things get centrifuged

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and be put into the vial
of what is the flu shot.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Now that flu shot, the
multi-dose flu shots,

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:84%
the ones that you have
like 10 shots in one vial,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:90%
still has mercury in it.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:90%
The individual ones don't.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.990 align:middle line:84%
But all of the viruses that
are-- all of the vaccines

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
have the potential of
having chicken blood,

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and chicken proteins,
and stray viruses

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:90%
injected into your system.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are also--
there's other vaccines

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
that have cow viruses and dog
viruses and caterpillar bug

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.906 align:middle line:90%
viruses.

00:10:29.906 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are now being used.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:84%
All of these tissues
are being used

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:90%
to grow the influenza viruses.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:84%
The DNA from those animals
and the stray viruses

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:84%
from those animals
end up in the vial

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:84%
of the solution
that ends up being

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
injected into you
or your children.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:84%
We are actually going
through a process

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:84%
now where it is
changing our genetics

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:84%
because those stray
viruses get incorporated

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:90%
into the human genome.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And that we are changing
the human genetics,

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and in my opinion, weakening the
entire population of the world.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they use animal
embryos and eggs for this?

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well,
viruses, in order for them

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
to replicate-- so if you
have a influenza virus,

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:84%
you have to make trillions
and trillions of them

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:84%
in order to make the solution
that goes in the vial.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, viruses can only
replicate in living tissues.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't grow them
in a Petri dish.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Or you can't
manufacture them through

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:84%
a different
manufacturing process.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:84%
These are live viruses
that are replicated.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And they can only
grow in tissues.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that started
with the polio vaccine

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
when they tried many different
ways to make the virus grow.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And what they ended up using
was kidneys from monkeys

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:90%
that they grew the virus in.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why those stray
viruses from those kidney

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.980 align:middle line:84%
monkeys, the SV 40 virus,
ended up in the population

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:84%
because they ended up in the
polio vaccine back in the '50s.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Now they're talking about
using monkey kidneys

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.980 align:middle line:90%
to make flu shots.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So now we will continue to get
that virus into the population.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Monkey kidneys?

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Monkey
kidneys and dog kidneys.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.227 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole cell line
called from dog kidneys.

00:12:13.227 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:84%
There's another cell
line that they're

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
using that is from
caterpillar eggs.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.777 align:middle line:90%
So we're getting bug, insect--

00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Caterpillar eggs?

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.856 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Yes, so now
we're getting bug DNA in us.

00:12:22.856 --> 00:12:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't announce
this too much do they?

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: They use tissues
from aborted fetal cells that

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.120 align:middle line:84%
have been a cell line in
perpetuity for a long time.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And cell lines that
divide in perpetuity,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:84%
they call them
immortalized cells.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Immortalized cells,
by definition,

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:90%
are cancerous cells.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And we use these cancerous cells
to grow the virus that ends up

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
in the solution that
ends up in your arm.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And the CDC, and
the governing bodies

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:84%
that are supposed to keep
track of all of these things,

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:84%
know that those stray
viruses are there,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:90%
know they can cause cancer.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
regulate the manufacturers

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:84%
to say that they
are only allowed

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to have a certain number of
those immortalized cancer

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
cells in the
vaccine because they

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:90%
know they'll cause problems.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got
to be a better way.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well,
there's not a better way

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:90%
to make any vaccines.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
There's just a better
way to stay healthy.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's
not a matter of this

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:90%
is the best of what you can do?

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.432 align:middle line:90%
It's all bad.

00:13:29.432 --> 00:13:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: That would be
my opinion, definitely yes.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe we're
about one generation away

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.880 align:middle line:84%
of having such contaminated
DNA that we have so

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:84%
weakened the human genome
that we are really set up

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill the pharmaceutical
industry's vision statement.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And their vision statement is
that every human on the planet

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:84%
will be on a minimum of two
prescription drugs every day

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:55.821 align:middle line:90%
for life.

00:13:55.821 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For the
rest of their life.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: And that starts by
injecting children, at birth,

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.880 align:middle line:84%
to make them customers for life
of the pharmaceutical industry.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the goal.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.613 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: I believe
that's the goal.

00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think they're
doing it through vaccines?

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: I believe that's
the place that it starts.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.551 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of people
would say, well,

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:84%
what about the genetically
modified food, and what

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:84%
about chem trails,
and what about

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:84%
the fluoride in the water,
and all these other things.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.170 align:middle line:90%
But vaccination starts at birth.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And now we are having--
the parents now

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that were born since
1991 are now old enough

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.540 align:middle line:90%
to start having families.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So now you got a
fully vaccinated mom,

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:84%
a fully vaccinated
dad with damaged DNA,

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.690 align:middle line:84%
getting together and
having a child that's

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.302 align:middle line:84%
going to have corrupted,
or suspected problems

00:14:39.302 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
with their
mitochondrial-- like all

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.176 align:middle line:84%
these mitochondrial
disorders they

00:14:42.176 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:84%
talk about-- is
coming from parents

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:90%
that are fully vaccinated.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So now you already have
a not so stable genetics

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:90%
in the child that's being born.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And so, that is
all happening prior

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
to the first mouthful of
genetically modified food

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:84%
that the child gets, or
the first time they brush

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.850 align:middle line:84%
their teeth with
fluoride in the water.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So we have something
that's happening out

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:84%
there of wanting to weaken
and debilitate the human race.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And like what you
said initially,

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:84%
that may be the place
where we can have a garden

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
variety of influenza virus that
can come along and wipe out

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:90%
a big portion of the population.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems
like every year

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:84%
there's a different
strain of some kind of flu

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:90%
that starts somewhere in Asia.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Someplace it pops.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they run around,
they scurry around,

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to develop a
vaccine to fight it.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
We're always one step
behind, aren't we?

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Oh, always.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And there are thousands of
influenza viruses out there.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Influenza is known to only
infect mammals and birds.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.989 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why's that?

00:15:49.989 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: I don't know.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
But that's why they say that
birds can be the carriers.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.772 align:middle line:84%
You can have influenza in
ducks, and chickens, and all

00:15:58.772 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:84%
the different birds
that have them.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And when the birds migrate,
and they go into ponds,

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and they poop, and they spread
around all these viruses.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And we create these new
viruses with these new genomes.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're always going
to be one step behind.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.000 align:middle line:84%
We're always going to have
this potential for more viruses

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:84%
being created than we'll
ever have vaccines for.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does it seem
that so much disease is

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.100 align:middle line:90%
in the Asian countries?

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.707 align:middle line:90%
And always around chickens.

00:16:25.707 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:10%
>>TENPENNY: Well, when you
look at that population

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.040 align:middle line:10%
and you look at where people
live in Asian countries,

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.662 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they live
with their animals.

00:16:32.662 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they sleep with them.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:34.070 align:middle line:90%
They live with them.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then they go the
market and buy these chickens.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Who are not
properly refrigerated.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, you can go in the
market and go behind there

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cage.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And you just go pick
out your chicken.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And they chop off its head and
you take it home for dinner.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.358 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chop its head and
you take it home, yeah.

00:16:48.358 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: And the amount of
pollution that is particularly

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:84%
in the major rivers in
China is just staggering.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Billions of tons of raw
sewage, of raw chemicals,

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:84%
of manufacturing discharges, so
the sanitation there is so bad.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:90%
And they use coal.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
kinds of reasons why

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.005 align:middle line:84%
that that population
is at greater risk.

00:17:10.005 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sherri, if
people have been wronged,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:84%
they generally can
litigate, right?

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.660 align:middle line:90%
You go to court.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:90%
You fight.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:84%
You really can't do
that with government.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And in most cases,
you can't do it

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.780 align:middle line:90%
with pharmaceutical companies.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:90%
They are protected.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.486 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:17:24.486 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: There was
a piece of legislation

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that was passed in 2006 that
was called Division E. That was,

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:84%
at the time, Senator Bill
Frist at the very end

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.634 align:middle line:84%
of a legislative session, it
was right before Christmas.

00:17:36.634 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Leaked it in.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: He actually stuck it
in on the backside of a Defense

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Appropriations Bill.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So the Committee
had already met.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.340 align:middle line:84%
They have already approved this
big budget for the defense.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Most of the committee
had gone home.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And he put in this
Division E document.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And inside of that
document it was the hugest

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:84%
win ever for the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.620 align:middle line:84%
That they cannot be sued, even
if they create a product that

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.420 align:middle line:90%
can kill you.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.836 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
knowingly, let's say.

00:18:02.836 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: And
knowingly do it, exactly.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And unless you prove intent,
which how are you ever going

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.900 align:middle line:84%
to do that, you can just be
killed by these products.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
They can actually
mandate and force you

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:84%
to get a vaccine
against your will,

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:90%
take a drug against your will.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.236 align:middle line:84%
And that's all inside of that
document called Division E.

00:18:19.236 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you
find a whistleblower

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:84%
from within this
company who says,

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
oh, we knew this was
not going to work,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:84%
or we knew people could be
harmed, you can't sue them.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: No, you
cannot sue them.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:84%
They're protected now more than
ever because of that document

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.750 align:middle line:90%
that was passed.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.712 align:middle line:90%
It was a really big deal.

00:18:36.712 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Many of the Senators and
Representatives-- even

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
at the time, Ted Kennedy was
still alive, and he said,

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
we frequently see the
pharmaceutical industry

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:90%
get big wins around here.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
We have never seen them get as
big a win as what this one is.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's blanket
throughout the industry.

00:18:51.285 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: That's blanket
across the industry.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So they are now
protected for anything.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.422 align:middle line:84%
About two years ago, there
was a lawsuit that was won--

00:18:58.422 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it went all the way
up to the Supreme Court--

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:84%
that said that even generic
drugs cannot be sued if they

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:90%
cause terrible harm.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:84%
In the vaccine industry,
we've had the National Vaccine

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Registry that's been
involved and you

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:84%
can't sue the
pharmaceutical company

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
over vaccines since 1986 when
Reagan signed that into play.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what a vaccine does.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.820 align:middle line:84%
It's made them
immune to lawsuits.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: There
you go, exactly yes.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.350 align:middle line:84%
It's also made them
immune to logic.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping that parents
will hear this discussion

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and they will
understand that they

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:84%
need to take
responsibility for what's

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:90%
coming through that needle.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:84%
They can't just look at
another person standing there

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.130 align:middle line:84%
in a white coat
who is-- why do we

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
have this whole thing that
the doctor knows best?

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that that's
going to die out

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
with the geriatric population
that grew up in the '40s that

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
really believed and
trusted in their doctor.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that parents now need
to take more responsibility.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And they need to
understand the best way

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
to take care of their
children is not necessarily

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle line:84%
what the pediatrician
tells them to do.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, most
of these doctors

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.580 align:middle line:84%
are told about these
new pharmaceuticals

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.917 align:middle line:84%
from the marketing sales
person of the drug company.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Exactly.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, in
the old days-- I

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
think it's changed somewhat--
didn't they also pay

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.970 align:middle line:84%
the doctors for pushing
their prescriptions?

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you had 50
patients and you

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:84%
wanted to put them
on medicine number x

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and you pushed it and
wrote the script for it,

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
you'd be rewarded from the
pharmaceutical company.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.582 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Yes, it was not so
much on an actual cash basis.

00:20:34.582 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
But you would get
these indirect rewards.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little perks?

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Like a free all
expenses paid trip to Hawaii.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Or that they would have some
big conference somewhere

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and you could go for free.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.496 align:middle line:84%
They have these speakers
that make tens of thousands,

00:20:48.496 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands
of dollars a year

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
pushing the drugs in the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So there have been
some rules that

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
have changed about that
in terms of marketing.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.146 align:middle line:84%
It's much less blatant,
but it still exists.

00:21:01.146 --> 00:21:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
some people who

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
have been indicted,
they've gone to jail,

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:84%
because they step forward and
say things about government.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Government accuses
them of things,

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
of bilking the public, different
issues, different cases,

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
but is there a battle
going on here now, Sherri,

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:84%
between government and
industry and individuals,

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:84%
like you, who are trying
to get the word out

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:90%
about certain things?

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.449 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Oh,
there absolutely is.

00:21:30.449 --> 00:21:34.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I just got a report a
couple of days ago about there

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:84%
was a very large conference
in Silicon Valley

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.422 align:middle line:84%
that they were talking about
writing these computer bots--

00:21:42.422 --> 00:21:44.880 align:middle line:84%
these bots that would go out
and look all over the Internet

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and look for certain keywords
and things like that.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And now they have decided
that Dr. Andrew Wakefield's

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
one and only retracted study,
and it was because of him, he

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:84%
falsified everything, that
that's the only thing that

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.020 align:middle line:90%
has anything to do with autism.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.379 align:middle line:84%
So they constantly make Dr.
Wakefield the scapegoat.

00:22:01.379 --> 00:22:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's destroy the guy.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Just
destroy the guy.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to do with
the MMR vaccine or anything

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.209 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:22:07.209 --> 00:22:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, they were talking
about this actually

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:84%
at the conference, and
said that because of that,

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.238 align:middle line:84%
we know that there's
all these people who

00:22:13.238 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
believe in these myths
that vaccines cause harm.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's never been
any proof anywhere

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that shows that
vaccines can cause harm.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And so they created a bot,
an actual computer bot,

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:84%
that goes out and looks for
anti-vaccine types of words

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and they have a
self-generating script

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:84%
that goes and debates and
fights all these people

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:90%
and shuts down websites.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes if you get into
an argument with somebody

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:84%
about vaccines, it
may be a computer bot.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:84%
It may not even
be a real person.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
this, ostensibly,

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
to shut down the discussion,
shut down the debate,

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:84%
take away parents' rights,
take away choice, take away

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.190 align:middle line:90%
your rights.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:84%
We talk about
children all the time,

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:84%
but what about your
right as an adult

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:84%
to not get a flu shot or
a Hepatitis B vaccine?

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Or what about the
people in the military

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:84%
who are just subjected
to everything.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when I was
going through the Navy, that's

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:90%
what I did.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:90%
They said, you need these.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.192 align:middle line:90%
And you get 'em--

00:23:06.192 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: And you get them.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With no
questions asked.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Yeah, there's
a little known portion

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:14.800 align:middle line:84%
of the military that
people who are considering

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
going into the military
may want to explore.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Is that if you declare your
religious exemption, which

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.670 align:middle line:84%
is upheld by the
US Constitution,

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.970 align:middle line:84%
declare your religious
exemption prior

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.970 align:middle line:90%
to becoming a military member.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.640 align:middle line:84%
That, I believe, is
still in the case.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.830 align:middle line:84%
That the military has to honor
that and your right to refuse.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:84%
However, once you're a military
member in any of the branches,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.194 align:middle line:84%
you are now property
of the US government.

00:23:40.194 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
subjected to whatever

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.207 align:middle line:90%
they want to do to you.

00:23:43.207 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that happens.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: And that
very much happens.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Happens quite a bit.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.030 align:middle line:84%
What do you see,
Sherri, to date,

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:84%
as the biggest issue
facing what you do?

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Is it the vaccine?

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:90%
What specifically is it?

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.207 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: The right
of freedom of choice,

00:23:59.207 --> 00:24:00.165 align:middle line:90%
the right to maintain--

00:24:00.165 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
being taken away.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well,
the right to be

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.030 align:middle line:84%
able to know what's in my food,
the labeling of genetically

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.220 align:middle line:90%
modified food.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:84%
The right to say, I
don't want any vaccines.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.970 align:middle line:90%
I'll do this differently.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.670 align:middle line:84%
My right to practice
medicine the way

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.070 align:middle line:90%
that I want to practice it.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:84%
That I want to recommend things
from a natural perspective

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and homeopathy and nutrition
and lifestyle changes.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Because they're trying
to take that away too.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.260 align:middle line:84%
With this new
legislation that is

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.402 align:middle line:84%
coming into play--
elements of Obamacare--

00:24:26.402 --> 00:24:27.860 align:middle line:84%
that have said that
there are going

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:90%
to be criteria as a physician.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.400 align:middle line:84%
That if you come in to me
and your cholesterol is not

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.320 align:middle line:84%
under control, and I don't
prescribe you a statin,

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:90%
I get a ding against my record.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're going to
tie that somehow to licensure.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're going
to be looking at vaccines

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.591 align:middle line:84%
in the future that could be
tied to all sorts of things

00:24:46.591 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't seen so far.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Things like, have you
had your flu shot,

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get your
driver's license renewed.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Or to be able to get
on an airplane you have

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.269 align:middle line:84%
to show documented proof
that you've had a flu shot--

00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:57.976 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No sickies
on this plane, right?

00:24:57.976 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Right.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:84%
They give flu shots now
in airports sometimes.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've often thought
about if somebody goes to go

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.559 align:middle line:84%
into an airport-- because
you and I travel a lot--

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and you go in there and
somebody gets a flu shot,

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.330 align:middle line:84%
what if the pilot
gets a flu shot,

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:90%
and halfway across the ocean--

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And has a reaction.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.124 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Has a reaction.

00:25:13.124 --> 00:25:15.360 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do with that?

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:90%
And they've done that before.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '40s, you could
not go on train travel

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.950 align:middle line:84%
without having proof of
having had a smallpox vaccine.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.324 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wow, I
didn't know that.

00:25:23.324 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: So there was the
first mandatory vaccination

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
laws that happened
in the UK in 1853.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
mandatory vaccination law

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that was ever passed
by government.

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
In 1867, they came out with
another mandatory smallpox

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:84%
vaccination law that had teeth,
which meant that they could put

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.830 align:middle line:84%
you in jail, they could
take all of your property

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and sell it, and
all of those things

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.980 align:middle line:90%
until you vaccinated your child.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like today.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well, we
have precedents for that.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:58.664 align:middle line:84%
So could we get to the
point of forcing you to say,

00:25:58.664 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
you can't have a
driver's license,

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.720 align:middle line:84%
you can't get on
an airplane, you

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:84%
can't walk into a
grocery store, you

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:84%
can't do any of these
things unless you

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:84%
can show that you've
been vaccinated?

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'll probably
do it in the chip, right?

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And so, you walk
through the store

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and an alarm goes off because
you haven't been vaccinated.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And everybody looks at you like
you're some common criminal.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Yes, exactly.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I could
see that happening.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: I could
see that happening too.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we've gotten
to the place where

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.165 align:middle line:84%
this whole vaccination industry
is completely out of control.

00:26:29.165 --> 00:26:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People will
run away from you.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:31.456 align:middle line:90%
>>TENPENNY: Yes.

00:26:31.456 --> 00:26:34.267 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Shopper number eight
has not been vaccinated.

00:26:34.267 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well, they
do that with parents.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Because somehow these parents
who vaccinate their kids say,

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.680 align:middle line:84%
if your kids aren't
vaccinated, I

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.100 align:middle line:84%
don't want to play
with your kids.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be the
most ludicrous of arguments

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:84%
because if vaccinations work
and they protect your kids who

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.502 align:middle line:84%
are vaccinated, why should you
care if this child over here

00:26:51.502 --> 00:26:53.104 align:middle line:90%
is unvaccinated?

00:26:53.104 --> 00:26:55.020 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing for you
to be concerned about.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.471 align:middle line:84%
But that's another one of
those indoctrination things

00:26:57.471 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:90%
that is happening.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've done a great
job with the fear factor.

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: They have
absolutely done that.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sad, scary.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Where does it go?

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:90%
How do people fight back?

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: I think
that parents need

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:13.560 align:middle line:84%
to really find a
like-minded community.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Find a like-minded
community that

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:84%
supports the way that they do
things in terms of their food

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and their water
and their vaccines.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
all about education.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:90%
People still don't know, George.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm so glad that we
can have these conversations.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Because there are still
millions of people

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:90%
that don't understand the risks.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we need
to take this information

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
to your local first
responders, and your police,

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and your firefighters,
and take them down

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.570 align:middle line:90%
to the grassroot people.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
It will never be
a top-down change.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.562 align:middle line:84%
The government won't suddenly
say, oh sorry, we were wrong.

00:27:46.562 --> 00:27:47.520 align:middle line:90%
That will never happen.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are people waking up?

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.000 align:middle line:10%
>>TENPENNY: People are
definitely waking up.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:10%
There are tens of millions of
more people that are awake now

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.830 align:middle line:10%
and concerned about this
than there ever were before.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Hepatitis
B shot, it's out there.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.970 align:middle line:90%
It's in the marketplace.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Restaurateurs now are
being forced to get it.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Waiters are being told,
you have to get it.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.080 align:middle line:84%
How did this pop
up all of a sudden?

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Well, actually,
that's the Hepatitis A vaccine.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And the Hepatitis A
vaccine is because they

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:84%
believe that Hepatitis A,
which is a very benign illness,

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:90%
is spread through fecal matter.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So people who are food handlers,
and maybe haven't appropriately

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
washed their hands,
can spread that.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I know, that's kind of
disgusting, isn't it?

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:29.870 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't
washed their hands.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.772 align:middle line:84%
And so that fecal matter
gets in the food processing

00:28:32.772 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
from the place
where they're picked

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.354 align:middle line:84%
from the plant, all the
way through the processing,

00:28:36.354 --> 00:28:38.120 align:middle line:84%
to the restaurant,
to on the table.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere along that
way somebody could

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.840 align:middle line:84%
have had fecal
matter on their hands

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.550 align:middle line:90%
and gotten it into your food.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.980 align:middle line:84%
But that has to
also be associated

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:50.050 align:middle line:84%
with having that person
had Hepatitis A. So

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:53.560 align:middle line:84%
that virus is supposed to be in
the food chain, which it's not.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.810 align:middle line:84%
It's just one of those things,
they created a vaccine.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most
worthless ones ever.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Because first of all,
it's highly reactogenic.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:84%
People can have all kinds
of neurological side effects

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.350 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you get Hepatitis A, what
does that infection look like?

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:90%
It looks like the flu.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.510 align:middle line:84%
You get nausea, vomiting,
lots of diarrhea.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:13.570 align:middle line:90%
You get jaundiced.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.200 align:middle line:84%
You turned yellow for
a week to 10 days.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Goes away with a
lifetime of immunity.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.770 align:middle line:84%
No long term complications
with your liver,

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
no long term complications
with anything.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.665 align:middle line:84%
But yet, we say we have
to have a vaccine for it.

00:29:26.665 --> 00:29:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sherri, I'm glad
you're out there pushing.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.802 align:middle line:84%
If people want more
information on what you do,

00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:31.510 align:middle line:90%
where do they go?

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:32.544 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:29:32.544 --> 00:29:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TENPENNY: Two
places that I like

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.357 align:middle line:84%
to send out a lot
of information.

00:29:35.357 --> 00:29:36.940 align:middle line:10%
One is through my
Facebook page, which

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.840 align:middle line:10%
is Dr. Tenpenny on Vaccines.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.710 align:middle line:10%
We have almost 100,000
people, 100,000 fans now

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.650 align:middle line:10%
getting that word out.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.691 align:middle line:10%
My website is drtenpenny.com.

00:29:45.691 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:10%
And that gives you all
sorts of information.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:84%
The Vaccine Research
Library, which is my website,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.450 align:middle line:84%
has over 6,000 articles
in it on problems

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:54.565 align:middle line:90%
associated with vaccines.

00:29:54.565 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Sherri.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.663 align:middle line:10%
>>TENPENNY: Thank
you so much, George.

00:29:57.663 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Read up on vaccines.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.530 align:middle line:10%
Read up on diseases.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:10%
And then you decide.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief".

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:22.867 align:middle line:90%
