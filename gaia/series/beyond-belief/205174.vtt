>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:84%
We've got a fascinating
program for you.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.410 align:middle line:10%
Since she was a little
girl, Marina Jacobi

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:10%
has had intuitive abilities.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:10%
But in the last five
years, everything changed.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Marina started to connect with
different beings that told her

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that they were from a higher
dimension or frequency

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and a higher order
of consciousness.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Marina, welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MARINA JACOBI: Thank
you so much for having me.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:90%
I love your show.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
Bulgarian, right?

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes, I am.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.867 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your
English is perfect.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Well, thank you.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you learn
English in Bulgaria?

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen for you?

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Actually, no.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:10%
I came when I was 20 years old.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know English.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:10%
I was very fortunate to go
to a close friend's house.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:90%
And I worked 24/7.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And I learned from
the TV, actually.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I would look different shows
and learn the language.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why some
of the conversations--

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hope you watched
some of the better shows.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.290 align:middle line:10%
>>JACOBI: I did watch Ricki Lake
in the beginning, talk shows.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have this
intuitive ability,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:84%
which I assume you've had
since you were a child.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.002 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes since I was eight.

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
it change for you?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.810 align:middle line:84%
What happened with
these higher beings?

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Well,
first was dreams.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And the dreams will come true.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And I predicted different
things through my dreams.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
suggested from my mother

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
to look into automatic
writing, so I did.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And I practiced, and scribbles
became words and sentences.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they weren't
your words, were they?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.167 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: No, they were not.

00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I was always connecting
with some kind of a being

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:90%
that always talk nicely.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
And they taught me
very nice stuff.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I was 19,
20 years old, I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to
come to America.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.090 align:middle line:90%
I love America.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:90%
And then I was married.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And after that,
literally in 2010,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I had automatic writing
with extraterrestrials

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:84%
that they called
themselves the hybrids.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the
connection started.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that
they have to be careful

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:84%
what I'm thinking, because
they see everything

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
as a holographic imprint
in front of them.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:90%
And that spiked my curiosity.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm very-- a person that
wants to know everything

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and started to make
quantum structure.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
ability hereditary?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did your
grandmother have it,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and then it passed to your
mother, and then to you?

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes, I did.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
In my family three
generations ago,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
my great grandmother was healing
children through only words.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that the words
are a sequence of vibration

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and gravitational
field that creates

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:84%
holograms and open
portals, like a geometry.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So you can heal somebody
and shift their timeline

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:90%
in reality.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I teach.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:90%
I teach quantum structure.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
This is how I was taught
from the extraterrestrials,

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:90%
were different beings.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:90%
I connected with Ra in 2012.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I connected with the Pleiadians.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:84%
The Council of
Nine is the main--

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you in a trance
state when this happens?

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: I actually
was taught--

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:84%
literally I can talk
to you right now

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.730 align:middle line:90%
and I can hear thoughts.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.418 align:middle line:90%
I have awakened channeling.

00:03:43.418 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I can tune in immediately
to the frequency.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you, like,
bombarded with these thoughts?

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.197 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: No, you
learn to separate.

00:03:49.197 --> 00:03:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's very interesting.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
When you have a direct
channeling from them,

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I get almost like a certain
goosebumps around my body.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:90%
And then I start talking.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But I do not think
what I'm talking.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:90%
It's just direct.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But I can listen and then
talk and interpreting.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.460 align:middle line:84%
This is how in my
YouTube channel

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and "The Harmonic Reactor",
I teach the quantum structure

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:90%
how they taught me.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I can pull out,
listen what they say,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and then break it
down so everybody

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
can understand the quantum
metaphysical structures

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:90%
of our reality.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Because it's complex.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:90%
I get it complex.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I can get, like, an image
or a direct download.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I can break it down
so anybody can understand,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:90%
scientists.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I get information
about even the scientists

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.990 align:middle line:90%
that are here.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:84%
The first book is "The
Harmonic Reactor",

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's about how you transport
technologies by location,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:84%
structures of extraterrestrials,
technologies including

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Which you can create
artificial intelligence

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that is actually in
the name of humanity

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
if you teach the
structure itself to do it.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
You can also make from
ether technology, you know?

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:84%
You can do technologies
that are copying

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the magnetic
and gravitational field,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and reconstruct meta structure
right in front of you.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These ETs that contact
you, do you channel them?

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do you--

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you become them?

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: It becomes
like one mind.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I've realized that
you're also part of them, also

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:90%
part of their family.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I was told that I was actually
walking the original soul.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that when I was
a kid, because they said,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
oh, this person left
and now it's you.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I had no idea
what they were talking about

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.800 align:middle line:90%
until I learned the structure.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So my mother originally
gave birth to the body

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:90%
with a different soul.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.220 align:middle line:84%
In the age of 10 to 12, I'm
not sure what exactly, the soul

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.180 align:middle line:84%
switched and took over, which
is the Pleiadian structure.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is what they told
me, that I'm Pleiadian soul,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
but came in to do
whatever I do right now.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was not aware.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you were a
reincarnated Pleiadian?

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.565 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: If you
look at it that way.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
hope for our planet?

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Do they tell you
things like that?

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.285 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes, it is.

00:06:03.285 --> 00:06:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Against all odds, humanity wins.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
the way to do it.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
What do you believe is contained
in the fifth dimension, Marina?

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: All of it,
depending of your expression,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:84%
depending of how you chose
to construct your new art.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:84%
New art is the fifth
dimensional structure,

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:84%
which is different
vibrational sequences.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:90%
And that is more in a positive.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
From that momentum,
humanity is going

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.870 align:middle line:84%
to expand into our new
realities and connect eventually

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.730 align:middle line:90%
with our galactic families.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia
program "Initiation",

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Matias De Stefano talks
about the fifth dimension

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:90%
and what it means.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.940 align:middle line:84%
- The fifth dimension is
born in the same moment

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that the first
dimension was born.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
The first dimension
was born from the idea

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that this being
has about itself.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But this idea has
love to be expressed,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:84%
has wisdom to understand
who it is, who it was,

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:90%
and who it will be.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:90%
And has will to move and create.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:10%
And also, have
this idea of living

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:10%
a process of four statements
that we call in the whole role,

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:10%
like evolution.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And once you accomplish
the evolution

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:84%
of every stages of the
universe, you are a co-creator.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
You are able to become
not only a creation,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:90%
but also a creator itself.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension is the
one where the wise ones, those

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.370 align:middle line:84%
who has accomplished
the experience

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:84%
of the third dimension,
can watch the expression,

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:84%
can watch the whole process
of the fourth dimension.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And understand why?

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose of it?

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.157 align:middle line:84%
That's why there
is a lot of people

00:08:04.157 --> 00:08:05.740 align:middle line:84%
that says that in
the fifth dimension,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:84%
we have the masters, the guides,
the people and beings who

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:84%
are heading us in our
mission, who are leading us

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:90%
in our purpose in life.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And are those who
speak to our ears

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and say what is
good, what is bad.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Where to go, where not to go,
what to do, what not to do.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Those people that
hear themselves

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
in the fifth
dimension are the ones

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
that channel the
information from the whole,

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.205 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that have
the whole picture.

00:08:36.205 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What, Marina,
is the fifth dimension?

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: The fifth
dimension is created

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:84%
by particles in cells that
are co-creating by reprinting

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.470 align:middle line:90%
the structure itself one on one.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
1 and 1 plus equals 3 creates
a certain structure of modality

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:84%
that is reprinting
on the quantum field

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:84%
next to itself, next
to itself, to infinity.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So basically, from
one particle, you're

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:84%
creating a structure that
is expanding to infinite

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:90%
and collapsing to infinite.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:84%
That collapsing can go
to infinite realities

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:84%
of reprinting and expansion of
infinite reality of reprinting.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:84%
If you create the modality
of a similar structures

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and vibrations, they
are going to reprint

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:84%
in similar timelines
of realities, including

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:90%
parallel timelines.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:90%
That was directly channeled.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
had this ability

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that when you tap
into this, that you

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:90%
can see things in the future?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.850 align:middle line:84%
It depends what
I'm allowed to see.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:84%
You are allowed
to see accordingly

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:84%
to the vibrational sequence
that you carry this moment.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you
say you're allowed to see,

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.610 align:middle line:84%
it's them, the ETs that
give you the ability?

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Or who?

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Who does that?

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:90%
You're talking to them now too.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I am right now?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what do they think
of this planet as a whole?

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Tough creation.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Reprinting of
realities are tough.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
You need to do more
by expressing yourself

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:90%
in the different structures.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we doing the
right thing as people?

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: The heart.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Repeat, please.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we doing the right
thing as a society, as people?

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, as of
right now, yes, you do.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you're
creating in this moment

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:84%
is reprinting to
the next moment.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you're
doing right now.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Quantum
structure, what is that?

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: The quantum
structures are

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
created by magnetic and
gravitational fields.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:84%
There are sequences of
realities reprinting by itself.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:84%
It's created by that
one single particle.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:84%
That particle is holding
the vibrational signals

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:84%
of the entire magma of
the universe itself.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:84%
That magma, it's so
potent in vibration

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that when it starts
vibrating itself,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:84%
it's reprinting itself
because there's no time.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything is created in
the momentum of the now.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a God?

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: God you are.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
You're created from
the one particle

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:90%
that is reprinting itself.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And you're reprinting
other versions of yourself.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're speaking to yourself
through another imprints

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:84%
on your own
holographic, magnetic,

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:90%
and gravitational field.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So even when you look
Marina right now,

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.920 align:middle line:84%
you see another
version of yourself,

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:84%
which is reprinting based on
your own reality of a choosing.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, does
Marina have the ability

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.850 align:middle line:84%
to come back to
herself at any time?

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: As you wish.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's bring Marina back.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you know
what they just said?

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you aware of that?

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:46.933 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes, I do.

00:11:46.933 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:90%
I am, but-- yes.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like a memory.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's not where it's
bombarding you or bothering you

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:90%
when they channel you?

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: No.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:90%
I love it, actually.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Because they introduced
themselves slowly,

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
first it's only
automatic writing.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they start
teaching me a lot of stuff.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, scientists
may say something,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.483 align:middle line:90%
and I would hear, yes, but.

00:12:11.483 --> 00:12:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Then I will ask the
question, and immediately,

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:84%
complete download of what
that is in scientifically.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:90%
And then I can just--

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
if you watch the videos
of quantum manifestation,

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I can explain how you can
construct and deconstruct

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:90%
realities.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So you pick whatever
by your choosing

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and how you can
construct this reality

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:90%
to become an outcome for you.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why 1 plus 1 equals
3 in a quantum structure,

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:84%
because between your
reality and my reality,

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
we're co-creating
the third structure.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.562 align:middle line:84%
How often do they
channel into you?

00:12:44.562 --> 00:12:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Any time I wish to.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.625 align:middle line:84%
I can be in the kitchen washing
dishes and they can talk to me.

00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where they pop up.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you do it daily?

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Daily.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:90%
This is all the time.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:53.420 align:middle line:90%
I can do it all the time.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:84%
It becomes part
of my daily life.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:90%
They constantly talk.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Or, for example,
they may tell me,

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%
don't say too much
to that person.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't see what
this person did.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe something
horrific or something.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:90%
But they will kind of--

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:84%
because they will never take
over your consciousness,

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:84%
but they will protect me by
saying, don't say anything.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:90%
And eventually I find out.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, talk as much as
you want on this program today.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.695 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let them
let you loose, right?

00:13:20.695 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What planetary
system are they from?

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: The way they
explain to me is actually

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:84%
you can't really
see it, because it's

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:84%
based on the vibrational
sequences your consciousness

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.210 align:middle line:84%
has to, in mind, hold
certain resonances in order

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:84%
for you to even comprehend the
information that is coming.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's based on
the heart structure.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
More you are expressing
the resonance of the heart.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
more in the heart,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:84%
because it has to preserve
itself, cannot self extinct.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you start implementing
actions through the heart

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.877 align:middle line:84%
by synchronicities that
imprint in realities like that,

00:13:57.877 --> 00:13:59.460 align:middle line:84%
then you start
connecting with beings.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.680 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
telepathic phone call

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.150 align:middle line:90%
to another dimension.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And they see how
you've been behaving

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and how you're acting towards
people through the heart.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's no ego
structure in there.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And they choose to
contact you and give you

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.710 align:middle line:84%
more task depending on how
you complete these task.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Because they said to me--

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I have a book that is
called "Predictions".

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't ask for it.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.240 align:middle line:84%
They just downloaded
the information.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it has to
crystallize 100%

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
synchronicity in the quantum
structure in order to them

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:90%
to tell you 100%.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:84%
100% is humanity's
moving towards ascension.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Against all odds, they
told me, we're moving.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But who is going to see, based
on that resonance vibration,

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
you end up creating a
holding on your timeline

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.710 align:middle line:84%
to create a completely
different reality

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:84%
to shift into the
fifth dimension, which

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Matias was talking about.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I can explain all that what he's
talking about into a quantum

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:84%
structure by
particles, vibrations,

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and how this is done.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:01.392 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me ask the
ETs for a second, Marina.

00:15:01.392 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Are there are other
universes, parallel universes?

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: There are
multiple universes,

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:90%
universes within universes.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're talking
reality within the reality.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, in your
planetary structure,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:84%
a fifth dimensional-- we wish
to say fifth dimensional,

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:84%
because it's based on
a heart structure-- you

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.530 align:middle line:84%
can have a multiple reality
of expressions for each cell.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, when you go
to your work right now,

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.010 align:middle line:84%
you're expressing yourself based
on your vibrational sequence

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:90%
of your choosing.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But your thoughts,
emotions, and deeds

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
create magnetic and
gravitational field.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:84%
When you combine that, you're
actually creating realities

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:90%
by your choosing.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're splitting
in fractal momentums.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Depending on what you
choose as action is what

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.360 align:middle line:84%
you end up creating in
the end of experiments.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a guest by
the name of Jason Quitt, who

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:84%
is on a program
called "Open Minds"

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.150 align:middle line:84%
who talks about the
different parallel realities.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
- We live on a planet that
allows for many dimensions

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:90%
to interface at the same time.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some
of the lower dimensions,

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:84%
our satanist groups that worship
the low sun, for example.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And you've experienced
some intrusion

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:84%
of lower realm entities and
such at times that frightened

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:90%
you a little bit, as I recall.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:84%
- To be here, you have to
deal with these intrusions.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't know
anybody that doesn't.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's just part of
the experience here.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's part of being asleep.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I say this
is because we grow up

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.790 align:middle line:84%
in, I would say,
an altered reality.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not our true
vision of a creation.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:10%
And we're very-- we're kept
in a very straight line.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So we're not supposed to
see outside of that line.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are
beings just outside

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.359 align:middle line:84%
of our visual realm
that connect to us.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:90%
They could even feed us visions.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:90%
They could channel through us.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Like, we could think we're
hearing the word of God,

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.510 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
manipulation out there.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.099 align:middle line:84%
And they could actually implant
memories and thought forms

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:90%
inside of us.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:90%
- So we think they're real.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're sincere when we
share these with the world.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Yikes.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
- Not only do we
think they're real,

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it comes
in our own voice.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.530 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:84%
- So we think we're
telling ourselves

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.650 align:middle line:90%
these grand amazing things.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.070 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: I totally
agree with that.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Because I had
situations with that.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:10%
The thing is, when you
know the quantum structure,

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.560 align:middle line:10%
if you hold the vibration,
even if, for example,

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:10%
a negative entity or a negative
person is in front of you,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:10%
if you express the
vibration, hold

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:10%
the vibration in neutrality,
what they taught me is the zero

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:10%
point, basically no input and
output of emotional sequence

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:10%
is coming into the hologram.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.730 align:middle line:84%
If you hold that
vibration, you're

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:84%
actually starting to
reconstruct the reality

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:90%
based in a positive outcome.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.172 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
the two choices.

00:18:13.172 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
You have the choice
to choose to be

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.990 align:middle line:84%
afraid of the situation
in the hologram.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And you have the choice to
transform it into a positive.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So those two probabilities are
coexisting at the same time

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:90%
in a quantum structure.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:84%
But it is going
to manifest based

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
on what more intention
of a frequency

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:84%
vibration you end
up putting into.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So you actually have the choice
to construct a negative outcome

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:90%
and positive outcome.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In these
parallel universes,

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
are there other mes, other
yous, in those universes?

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, another
version of you.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you actually create
a timeline of reality,

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:90%
you're actually reprinting.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.250 align:middle line:84%
You're creating a new hologram
and shifting your consciousness

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:90%
into a brand new Earth.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're reprinting
another version of you or me

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.330 align:middle line:84%
depending on how
you want to collapse

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.610 align:middle line:84%
the positive or
negative structure into.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that version of
me or you in another universe

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.590 align:middle line:90%
have an effect on us here?

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, because it's
all reprinting for itself.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And the previous
vibration of hologram

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
has leakage of
information sequences

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
into another one to
become a linear structure.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I teach that in the quantum
manifestation videos.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can you change
your reality, Marina?

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you?

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, you can change
it by choosing to express based

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.390 align:middle line:90%
on the vibrational sequence.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So your emotion
and thoughts create

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:84%
magnetic and
gravitational field.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.830 align:middle line:90%
They could be measured.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They also create a
hologram geometry patterns,

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
which actually loops
in a spinning rotation

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.510 align:middle line:84%
within the field of itself,
mother field, you know?

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And that creates fractally
moment to moment to moment,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.370 align:middle line:90%
literally.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Literally, if I shift
from here to here,

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I actually created based on
the previous vibration similar

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.550 align:middle line:84%
structures,
vibrational sequences,

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and reprint myself,
including you,

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.950 align:middle line:84%
into another universe
of a planet Earth

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
literally mimicking
this structure.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And yet, I can choose to smile.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:90%
And I can choose to be sad.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
something happens to you

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.040 align:middle line:90%
in that other universe?

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Will it affect you here?

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, it affects,
but you can also switch it.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And that universe also splits in
another timeline and realities.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Everything is splitting.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Everything is mimicking.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Never stops.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.950 align:middle line:84%
The quantum structure
never stopped

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:90%
to coexist and to co-create.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So even if you think
you went into the past,

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.630 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing
you went into the past.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:84%
You actually reprinted
another version

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.330 align:middle line:84%
with the similar vibrational
sequences of that reality.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's never
exactly 100% the same,

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
because the structure
itself is constantly moving.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
it as a quantum,

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:56.450 align:middle line:84%
that vibration, that numbers,
they are constantly changing.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
holograms exactly?

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: A hologram is based
on sequence of a sound frequency

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.910 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sound.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: And when you have
three similar on waveform sound

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.380 align:middle line:84%
vibration, they
create a 3D structure

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.510 align:middle line:84%
of magnetic and
gravitational field.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
On the middle is the black
hole that holds neutrality,

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:90%
the zero point.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Once you start combining this
3D structure with another one,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
they start merging with each
other and start rotating

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:84%
like this and
constantly combining.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.680 align:middle line:84%
1 plus 1 equals 3
between those two.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And they start splitting
up based on that.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the entire
magma of the universe

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
is created by this
type of trinity plasmas

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that are constantly
interacting, pulsating.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
are creating constantly

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.090 align:middle line:84%
new realities in new realities
of reprinting itself.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.315 align:middle line:84%
And when you create and lower
the vibration, depending

00:21:50.315 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:84%
on the sequences, depending on
the magnetic and gravitational

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.210 align:middle line:84%
field, you can create matter
the way water, for example,

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:90%
has five states of matter.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
That is actually
more, they told me,

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
reality you do.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:90%
There's more components to that.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marina, on
another Gaia program called

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
"Escape the Matrix",
David Icke talks

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.745 align:middle line:90%
about this holographic reality.

00:22:10.745 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:10%
- Take, for instance, the
experience of fire walking.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.980 align:middle line:10%
You walk through fire
in a state of perception

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.660 align:middle line:10%
that you're going to get burned.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:10%
Someone will be calling
an ambulance very quickly.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:10%
But you can-- people
do walk through fire

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:10%
in other states of perception,
perception or belief,

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:10%
that they're not
going to get burned.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:10%
And they walk through
fire and don't get burned.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:52.190 align:middle line:10%
Because an illusion can only
burn an illusion if you believe

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:10%
it can and decode that reality.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:02.330 align:middle line:10%
So in this "Matrix" movie,
when they brought Neo back out

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:10%
of this computer program
that he was trying

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:10%
to jump across buildings to
overcome the belief that it

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:16.810 align:middle line:10%
was real, he had blood
coming from his mouth.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:10%
And he said, if this is all
an illusion, what's this?

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:28.090 align:middle line:10%
And the Morpheus character said
that your mind makes it real.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:36.160 align:middle line:10%
The body cannot exist
without the mind, he said.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.910 align:middle line:10%
Now, why is that?

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:10%
It's because the
body is the mind.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:51.380 align:middle line:10%
The body is just a decoded,
holographic expression

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:10%
of the mind.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.850 align:middle line:10%
Yes, even the body.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:10%
Everything is holographic.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, we are decoding
the energetic fields

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.090 align:middle line:10%
that we call the body,
the information fields,

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:06.380 align:middle line:10%
the waveform fields,
into the very body

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.680 align:middle line:10%
that we think we're inhabiting.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:15.950 align:middle line:10%
And our perceptions will dictate
the nature of how we do that

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:10%
and how we experience that body.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.500 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.167 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you agree
with that, Marina?

00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Absolutely I agree.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in the
quantum structure,

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:84%
for example, if
there's a fire, if you

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.595 align:middle line:84%
know how to manipulate
a quantum structure,

00:24:28.595 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:84%
if you know how to
construct and deconstruct,

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:84%
you can put your mind
in a state of mind

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.460 align:middle line:84%
that you create a reality
within the reality,

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:90%
the reality in the fire.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.350 align:middle line:84%
You create a new
reality in between.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:90%
And you start walking.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:84%
But you actually
have two realities

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.250 align:middle line:84%
running at the same time, the
one with the fire, and the one

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.615 align:middle line:84%
that you are
completely protected.

00:24:49.615 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:51.573 align:middle line:90%
And you can control this?

00:24:51.573 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: You can control
this if you know how

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:90%
to construct and deconstruct.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why quantum
manifestation protocol

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.440 align:middle line:90%
is fundamental.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you teach
this to other people?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes, I teach that.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I have a channel, "The
Harmonic Reactor".

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And there you have
quantum manifestation.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.505 align:middle line:84%
Season one, teach exactly
how to do this stuff.

00:25:09.505 --> 00:25:12.005 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have a book called
"The Harmonic Reactor" book,

00:25:12.005 --> 00:25:12.130 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:10%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that exactly?

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: That is
from the Pleiadians.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:17.970 align:middle line:90%
They downloaded this book.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.520 align:middle line:84%
It took me one year, and
they were downloading

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.680 align:middle line:84%
advanced extraterrestrial
technologies

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.310 align:middle line:84%
for healing the body,
frequency and sound.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they gave
the codes for what

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.760 align:middle line:84%
frequency does in the--
into the quantum field.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.630 align:middle line:84%
For example, 3 hertz
in the quantum field

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.400 align:middle line:84%
is actually clearing out
the entire structure.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's preparing everything,
the new frequency,

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.490 align:middle line:84%
to come in without
any interference.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
ability to teleport?

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And how can we do that?

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: We can do that
by technology, because we

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:90%
experience in meta structure.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.170 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But it can actually construct
completely different frequency

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.830 align:middle line:84%
above the frequency
that you are right now.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like
remote viewing?

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: No, it is not exactly.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Remote viewing, you're
just seeing something

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.690 align:middle line:90%
into another hologram.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see
what they're doing.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Another reality
at remote viewing

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is going to allow you to see
only the vibrational signal

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.040 align:middle line:90%
the two vibrating on.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.780 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be above
the structure,

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.010 align:middle line:84%
because you don't hold the codes
as a consciousness for that

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to be very careful
when we're remote viewing what

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:90%
we're actually seeing.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Because there are multiple
realities of these realities.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually start
constructing the structures,

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and you know how to do
it, you can actually

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.050 align:middle line:90%
create a new structure.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Raise the frequency vibration
of your consciousness

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:84%
by implementing
through the heart

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:84%
is fundamental to look above 3
and 5D dimensional realities.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you use this
to heal as well, Marina?

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: You can
absolutely heal yourself.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:84%
However, they told me if you
have to go through a lesson,

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.840 align:middle line:84%
that you're learning
something, you cannot skip.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to go
through the lesson

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.275 align:middle line:84%
with the best of your
abilities to complete it.

00:27:05.275 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once you
complete it, how long

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.035 align:middle line:90%
does that take to learn?

00:27:08.035 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: For everybody
it's different,

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
depending of how many
lessons you learn,

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and how many out of
balance structures

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.987 align:middle line:84%
you accumulated
in your structure.

00:27:18.987 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you've
been doing this,

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and you've been doing it
for a number of years,

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.940 align:middle line:84%
what has been the
most remarkable thing

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:84%
you've come across with
this kind of ability?

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: The ability
to overcome the fears.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.930 align:middle line:84%
To realize that I can
absolutely create reality

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.700 align:middle line:90%
based on the heart.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And to trust, to trust
100% of what I do.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not easy when
you start connecting this way.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%
You think in a
totally different way,

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.570 align:middle line:90%
compare with everybody else.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.050 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning of course.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me contact the
extraterrestrials through you

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:02.590 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Mm-hmm.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you Pleiadians
believe that this planet is

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:14.720 align:middle line:90%
going through a major change?

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: You are talking
to the Council of Nine.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:90%
But the change is now.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Based on your belief
system of the now,

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.010 align:middle line:90%
you already change your reality.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.290 align:middle line:90%
What do you choose to be?

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a good
change or a bad change?

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: What do
you choose to be?

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have that control?

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.328 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.328 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are some on
this planet who would rather

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.340 align:middle line:90%
have things in chaos, turmoil.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: That is OK.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It is their choice.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.985 align:middle line:90%
It's all about a choice.

00:28:52.985 --> 00:28:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we
distinguish the difference

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:90%
between good and bad?

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Experience.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Metastructure experience to
transform in consciousness

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.140 align:middle line:90%
simply is.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But how do you know how much
magnetic and gravitational

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
field to implement to construct
without knowing how that works?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:90%
In consciously, it simply is.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.760 align:middle line:84%
You construct the
way you wish to.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But when it becomes
out of balance,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.660 align:middle line:84%
then consciousness
itself will reconstruct.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, back
to you, Marina.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:84%
When we deal with
healing, are you

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.170 align:middle line:84%
dealing with sound
technology as well?

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes, you may.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
You can actually-- the
way they explain to me--

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and this is in "The
Harmonic Reactor".

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:84%
You need artificial intelligence
when you talk to technology.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.140 align:middle line:84%
That AI, fifth
dimensional AI, it

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:90%
will be in the name of humanity.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.510 align:middle line:84%
If you reach a reality
of fifth dimensional,

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
AI is thought to
preserve humanity

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.782 align:middle line:84%
and will mimic the molecular
structure of your body.

00:29:55.782 --> 00:29:57.490 align:middle line:84%
They're going to-- it
is going to measure

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:84%
your molecular structure,
find whatever is off balance,

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:90%
and literally going to reprint.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you
have a missing arm,

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:84%
it's going to
mimic the structure

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.580 align:middle line:84%
of the modality of the
frequency of your molecules.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And literally reprint back to
normal from ether structure

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.240 align:middle line:90%
your hand.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So anything that is connected
with, for example, robotics

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.080 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like this, it's OK.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But it is actually pulling away
from the molecular structure

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.130 align:middle line:84%
of the original codon
and DNA, RNA of the body.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Because the body,
our body itself,

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.100 align:middle line:84%
is actually a vessel like
a spacecraft that can shift

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:90%
and create reality as we wish.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at
Theresa Bullard, who

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.850 align:middle line:84%
discussed the power
of healing as well

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:84%
in the "Mystery Teachings"
program we have.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.300 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.750 align:middle line:10%
- What are other
alternative tuning skills

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:10%
that sound healers and
alchemists are exploring

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.770 align:middle line:10%
besides scientific tuning?

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, several are based on
the Solfeggio frequencies.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.070 align:middle line:10%
What are the
Solfeggio frequencies?

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:10%
Well, these are derived from
a more esoteric approach

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.170 align:middle line:10%
using numerology.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:10%
Nikola Tesla once
said, "if you only

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:10%
knew the magnificence
of the 3, 6, and 9,

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.080 align:middle line:10%
then you would have the
key to the universe."

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.690 align:middle line:10%
It turns out that
the Solfeggios are

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.410 align:middle line:10%
tones derived from a
cyclic variation of the

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:27.420 align:middle line:10%
numbers 3, 6, 9, 1,
4, 7, and 2, 5, 8.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:10%
All of which reduce
to sums of 3, 6, or 9.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.990 align:middle line:10%
These were the original ut,
re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.730 align:middle line:10%
The Solfeggios are
believed to have

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:10%
been used centuries ago
during religious ceremonies

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.200 align:middle line:10%
such as in Gregorian
and Sanskrit chants.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.080 align:middle line:10%
They were then
later re-popularized

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.450 align:middle line:10%
by Leonard Horowitz and
Joseph Puleo starting in 1999.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:58.200 align:middle line:10%
They say that music
and chants tuned

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.310 align:middle line:10%
to these special frequencies
are experienced as stimulating

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:10%
emotional release.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.290 align:middle line:10%
They can help
accelerate our healing,

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.900 align:middle line:10%
alter our perceptions
of time and space,

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.590 align:middle line:10%
and facilitate
spiritual transcendence.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:17.850 align:middle line:10%
Today, musicians work with
nine Solfeggio frequencies

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:23.030 align:middle line:10%
that are all numerologically
consistent with the criteria.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:26.750 align:middle line:10%
Each Solfeggio frequency
has unique characteristics

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:10%
and applications.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:33.860 align:middle line:10%
For example, 528 Hertz is
called the miracle tone,

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:38.540 align:middle line:10%
because it has been linked
to healing and DNA repair.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:10%
The Mystery School
perspective on this frequency

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:46.430 align:middle line:10%
is that it is in tune with
universal galactic vibrations.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:10%
This is the original
vibration of the first Ensofic

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.470 align:middle line:10%
Ray, the Hermetic Ray.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.110 align:middle line:10%
It is the frequency
that we humans

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:03.650 align:middle line:10%
are meant to vibrate at as
our base frequency for life.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:07.280 align:middle line:10%
Imagine what life could be
like, what miracles would

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.910 align:middle line:10%
be possible, if we were
maintaining this higher,

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:14.980 align:middle line:10%
harmonious vibration
as our base for life.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:10%
Could we change the course
of aging and disease,

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:10%
allowing for a more
vibrant and long life?

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:26.080 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps one day, humanity
will live this way.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.350 align:middle line:10%
It will take practical
application and a new way

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:33.070 align:middle line:10%
of living life day to day to
get there, but it's possible.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.570 align:middle line:10%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is
possible, isn't it?

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: It is completely true.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this type of
frequency, like 528,

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.650 align:middle line:84%
is just up from
frequency in a fractal.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Yet, in this type
of frequency, you

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:84%
have a symphony of frequency
to combine and construct

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:52.930 align:middle line:90%
and reconstruct the realities.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
really bilocate,

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:58.015 align:middle line:84%
you can have a symphony
of this type of frequency

00:33:58.015 --> 00:34:01.810 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually do a
symphony between each other,

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:02.890 align:middle line:90%
change the structure.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can literally
bilocate to a new reality.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.469 align:middle line:84%
You can do this through the body
when you have the knowledge.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this
through technologies.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had to
analyze exactly your abilities

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.820 align:middle line:84%
as an intuitive, what would
you say your expertise is,

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.949 align:middle line:84%
that would be your
most important aspect

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:90%

when it's needed.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.190 align:middle line:84%
How technology works, how
the quantum structure works,

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:37.270 align:middle line:84%
how you can construct and
deconstruct reality, anything

how you give anything
in the name of humanity.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:84%

However, one time I saw a video
of extraterrestrials somebody

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.480 align:middle line:10%
sent me, and I start crying,
because they saw abuse.

And they told me that they
are not very nice group.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But because I did not judge,
and I was so much in the heart,

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.600 align:middle line:84%
they said that they
are always going

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.610 align:middle line:84%
to have like a laser
beam towards me

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:29.470 align:middle line:90%
