00:00:05.262 --> 00:00:07.595 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people don't know

00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:08.780 align:middle line:90%
what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.574 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.481 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:10%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
back to another edition

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:10%
And again, our very special
guest is Stephen Bassett.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:10%
Stephen, of course, with
the Paradigm Research Group,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:10%
who has been attempting--
for a number of years

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:10%
now-- to try to bust
through the government truth

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:10%
embargo on
extraterrestrial presence.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:84%
He is involved heavily
in the Citizen Hearing

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and the Congressional Hearing
Initiative, and, of course,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
he has done a remarkable job
trying to get the word out

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:90%
about ETs and its presence.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.849 align:middle line:84%
You just don't give
up, Stephen, do you?

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> STEPHEN BASSETT: That's
what an activist does.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of people in this
field that have been in it even

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:10%
longer I. Recently,
Stan Friedman,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:10%
who is 80, who has
been it now 50 years,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.267 align:middle line:10%
had a mild heart attack.

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:10%
I'm sending out our good wishes.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.605 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: He's a fighter.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:17.854 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: And I have other
colleagues that have been

00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:10%
in 25, 35 years.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.576 align:middle line:84%
It's an issue that,
once you get into it,

00:01:20.576 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
to let it go.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.751 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Stanton was my very
first radio interview

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.512 align:middle line:84%
when I was 21 years
old, back in 1971.

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Yeah.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Just an amazing story.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And I had the little clipping
that I saw in "The Detroit

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:84%
News" and it said,
ufologist Stanton Friedman

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and nuclear physicist speaking
before Oakland University

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:90%
on UFOs.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And I took this little
clipping to my news director,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and I said, I want to
go cover this tonight.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:90%
And he went, no.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not spending the
money for overtime

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:84%
for you to go off and
do some UFO thing.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm
going by myself, on my own.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, fine, if
you want to do that.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:90%
And I never looked back.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And the
rest is history.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.723 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yep.

00:02:05.723 --> 00:02:06.607 align:middle line:90%
Never looked back.

00:02:06.607 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:10%
Tell me about the Citizen
Hearings, Stephen.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Essentially, the
advocacy movement has been

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:84%
playing chess with the
government now, seriously,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
for the last 20 years,
going back to mid 1990s.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.790 align:middle line:84%
All advocacy is a chess game
with the government, whatever

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:90%
the issue.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:84%
You are trying to maneuver
the government into a position

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.374 align:middle line:84%
where it has to do
what you want it to do.

00:02:27.374 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Right?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of ways
you can play this game.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:84%
The government always has
more pieces, more money,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.240 align:middle line:90%
but not infrequently we win.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Well this, this is a very
significant chess game

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
in an issue that's
unlike, probably,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:90%
any advocacy issue ever.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to
position the government

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.117 align:middle line:84%
where it has no choice but
to go to the American people

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and say that there's an
extraterrestrial presence.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:84%
The Citizen Hearing may
be the breakthrough,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.250 align:middle line:84%
the Citizen Hearing
on Disclosure,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
may be the breakthrough
event that allows us to--

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.562 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Tips the scale.

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:01.811 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: -- checkmate them.

00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, get them
into checkmate.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:90%
But it goes back to late 2011.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Paradigm Research Group was
able to submit a petition

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to the White House
under a program

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.825 align:middle line:84%
that they developed in late
2011, calling for disclosure.

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:17.009 align:middle line:84%
We called it Disclosure
Petition One, right?

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You did
that online, right?

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: It was online.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:10%
We the people.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:10%
Its on the website even now.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.039 align:middle line:10%
You can go see this
petition on the website.

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:10%
And you had to get
so many signatures

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:10%
and you got a response.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.460 align:middle line:10%
Well, we got enough signatures
to get that response.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And the petition called
for President Obama

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:84%
to disclose, to announce the
extraterrestrial presence.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:90%
That's the simple petition.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:90%
There have been five more since.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, the response came
on November the 4th.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
It was published on their
website, it's still there,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and it's the formal position
of the Obama Administration.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's one
key paragraph where

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
it states that there's
no evidence, at all,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:90%
for life outside the planet.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:84%
No evidence for any
engagement of this planet

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrials.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And no evidence that the
government has hidden anything.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And what's notable about that,
besides the fact that it's

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.760 align:middle line:84%
completely false, is it's
the first time in history

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:84%
the Executive Branch
has put its position

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle line:90%
on this subject in writing.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.417 align:middle line:84%
You see, that's not
a good thing to do.

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to do that.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're trapped.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Because then,
you're fixed to that position,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.544 align:middle line:84%
and you may ultimately
have to defend it.

00:04:19.544 --> 00:04:21.294 align:middle line:84%
Now the media hasn't
gone after him on it.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:90%
So they haven't defended it yet.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:90%
But now we had a fixed position.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And so from that
point forward, it

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
was to work from there to
where we want to get to,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
which is disclosure.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
The Citizen Hearing
on Disclosure

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.789 align:middle line:90%
was the next major move.

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
We did several more
petitions to the White House,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
pointing out all the evidence
that they say doesn't exist.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But the Citizen Hearing
was the key event,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
one that was
originally conceived

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.695 align:middle line:84%
in 2000, 13 years in the
making, and was impossible.

00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:50.070 align:middle line:10%
Didn't have the money.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:middle line:10%
We finally got the
money to do it.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And so it was held
April 29 to May 3.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Why is it a special event?

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Why is it unique?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Because, what happened
in those five days

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:84%
is that 42 witnesses
from 10 countries,

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:84%
13 of the top researchers
in the world, 29

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:84%
what we call political
military agency witnesses, most

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
of high rank and
station, were brought

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
to Washington to the
National Press Club,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
two blocks from the White House,
12 blocks from the Capital,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:84%
into a setting in the
main ballroom designed

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
to look like a
congressional hearing.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:10%
And they testified for 30 hours
over five days, 20 sessions,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:10%
about a range of the key
issues, fully organized,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:10%
presenting verbal prepared
statements and then asking--

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.749 align:middle line:10%
answering questions from
six former members--

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: These were
all real people.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: -- of the Congress.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.217 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: No acting
here, at all.

00:05:45.217 --> 00:05:46.008 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: No, no.

00:05:46.008 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:10%
These are six former members,
five members of the Congress,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:10%
one senator, three
Democrats, two Republicans,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:10%
and a Libertarian-- with
80 years of service.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:10%
Two had just retired from
the Congress that January.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:10%
>> It's our commitment to
listen through objective ears,

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:10%
and to ask the kinds of
questions that we think that

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:10%
the American people
would like us to ask.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: And they came
in, they had been provided

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:10%
materials in advance,
which they had studied.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:10%
But they came in to this
Citizen Hearing on the fence.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.669 align:middle line:90%
It was clear.

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: As they would have in
a real congressional hearing.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Which is
the way it should be.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: I mean, even if
you have strong opinions,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:84%
you're supposed to go in to
objectively get information.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Hearings in Congress
are fundamentally

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.310 align:middle line:84%
about providing information
to make good law.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
They're not supposed to be
about destroying your opponents,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Or destroying the other party.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But rather getting
information to make good law.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.241 align:middle line:84%
Now that's obviously
not the way it is now.

00:06:42.241 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But there have been many
important hearings in history.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:90%
We know about them.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they came in,
and within three hours

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.390 align:middle line:90%
they were already going, what?

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:90%
You're kidding?

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.290 align:middle line:10%
They were transformed.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:10%
And all of them, by the
end of this process,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.522 align:middle line:10%
were not only wanting
to help if they could,

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:10%
they actually did some things
to be helpful during that week,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.097 align:middle line:10%
but were clearly
committed to the fact

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:10%
that there's something here and
we need congressional hearings

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:10%
on it.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:90%
So that was all filmed.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.187 align:middle line:90%
All 30 hours was filmed.

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And it will be--

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: An
unprecedented event.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:21.845 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right here.

00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And that is what
the set is going to look like

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.561 align:middle line:90%
that's going to go to Congress.

00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So now we have-- what
do we have on tape?

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.534 align:middle line:10%
What we have on
tape, or on DVD, is

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:10%
what the hearings
would look like.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.614 align:middle line:10%
See, this is what's
unprecidented.

00:07:34.614 --> 00:07:36.530 align:middle line:10%
>> STANTON FRIEDMAN:
Flying saucer visitations

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:10%
and the cosmic Watergate
represent the biggest story

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:10%
of the millennium.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:10%
>> They knew, meaning the people
that are involved with studying

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:10%
the phenomena in the government,
that we are dealing with

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.510 align:middle line:10%
technology so advanced that they
literally can bend space-time

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:10%
and move point to point
through the universe.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:10%
>> RICHARD DOLAN: We demand
and deserve answers from

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:10%
responsible officials, who
ought to be in the know.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not
in the know, we all

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
need to investigate and
find out just who is.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.742 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:11.742 --> 00:08:13.105 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:16.705 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And so when those
are delivered to Congress later

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
in November this year, 535 sets,
5,300 discs are going to be

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:84%
sent to the Hill, where
there's 10,000 staffers,

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:90%
in 535 offices.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
All 10,000 have laptops
with DVD players.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
accompanied by a tweet and email

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
storm, where they're going
to get a whole lot of media

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.010 align:middle line:84%
letting them know
these disks are coming,

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:90%
you need to look at them.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
When they open and look
at any one of those DVDs,

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
what they will see is what
the witnesses are like, what

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be saying,
what former colleagues

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
of theirs, how
they reacted to it.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.910 align:middle line:84%
They're going to see
it went very well.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:90%
It was very professional.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:84%
The audience was
very appreciative.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it strips
all the risk out of it.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.972 align:middle line:84%
And so when I go to them
in November and say,

00:09:04.972 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
would you like to improve
your approval rating?

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:07.805 align:middle line:90%
It's currently at 9%.

00:09:07.805 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Yeah, let's
do the real thing.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: All you need to do
is to get your committee chair

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.312 align:middle line:10%
to agree to bring
these witnesses up.

00:09:16.312 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:90%
And we've got plenty of them.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes, you do.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Not just those,
but another 100 behind those.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.493 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You've got more, yeah.

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Pick 35 really
strong witnesses and just sit

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:90%
there and listen.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.271 align:middle line:90%
Listen!

00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:84%
We're not asking you to walk
out on the steps of the Capital

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and proclaim the presence
of extraterrestrials.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:90%
No!

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.173 align:middle line:10%
Just sit there and
listen and ask them

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:35.876 align:middle line:10%
intelligent
questions, that's all.

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: This is
not too much to ask.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:10%
And more importantly, this
is a nonpartisan issue.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:84%
This would be a
nonpartisan hearing.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And so you won't have to
deal with each side trying

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.182 align:middle line:90%
to score political points.

00:09:51.182 --> 00:09:52.640 align:middle line:84%
All you're going
to be dealing with

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
is possibly helping to bring
about the most important event

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Wouldn't you like to
be part of something like that?

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And you're not
trying to nail someone,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.485 align:middle line:84%
like Bobby Kennedy was
after Hoffa in those days.

00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:07.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, this wasn't
a confrontational type

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:90%
of hearing.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:90%
This was informational.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the types of
witnesses that you

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.145 align:middle line:84%
brought before the Citizens
Hearing for Disclosure.

00:10:15.145 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Well, one
of the witnesses is Dr.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.435 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell, of
course, who, since 1997--

00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Apollo 14 astronaut.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: Apollo 14
astronaut, walked on the moon,

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:10%
MIT PhD in aeronautics, a
relatively substantive man has

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:10%
been stating quite
unequivocally, since 1997,

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:10%
that Roswell was an alien craft.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And he's
from there, isn't he?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Yeah, and one of
the reasons he knows that is

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.970 align:middle line:84%
because he was
raised in Roswell.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And so a whole lot
of Roswell people

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:84%
talked to him that maybe
never talk to anyone else.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Plus he knows
about the research.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.294 align:middle line:84%
Plus he's had meetings with
people in the Pentagon.

00:10:48.294 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And the sum total of it, he
knows there's any ET presence.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And he has stated that
over and over again.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:90%
He will be a witness.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:84%
We have SAC base officers from
the Malstrom Air Force Base

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.912 align:middle line:84%
case, and other nuclear
tampering events.

00:11:00.912 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah,
this fascinates me.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.024 align:middle line:84%
We talked about this in our
preview show with you, Stephen.

00:11:05.024 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Yes.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This presence
over missile silos.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.602 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:12.018 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: You know, there's
over 200 witnesses that have

00:11:12.018 --> 00:11:14.770 align:middle line:84%
been interviewed by researchers
like Robert Hastings.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And this event includes
the Bentwaters case.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:90%
These people are still alive.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:90%
They're retired.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:90%
They're out in the open.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.776 align:middle line:90%
They're willing to talk now.

00:11:21.776 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's more
witnesses behind them,

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that they know about,
that they're talking to,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that are weighing whether
they want to come forward.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we could put
8, 9, 10, 12 Air Force

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:84%
officers in front of a hearing
in November or December,

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.210 align:middle line:84%
corroborating each other's
testimony on a craft coming

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
down, hovering over the
base, and turning off

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.900 align:middle line:84%
all of the missiles of
more than just one site.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Amazing.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: One after another,
something that is impossible.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Just to
prove we can do this.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Well, we don't know.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I know that many of the
people that witnessed this

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:84%
are stating that they
believe that this was not

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:90%
a hostile act.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:84%
That everything that they
have seen and learned since

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:84%
tells them that this
was more of a message.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: If it was hostile,
they would've destroyed it.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Yeah, they
could have melted them down.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.100 align:middle line:84%
They turn them off,
we turn them back on.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:84%
The message they believe--
now this is a message,

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, only the ETs
know for sure-- is that why do

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:90%
you have these?

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:84%
You're certainly not going
to use them against us.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:84%
There's technology that will
eventually make them outdated.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:84%
All they're going to do is
destroy you and your planet.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:90%
I hope that's the message.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
witnesses think that.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:90%
But whatever!

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:10%
The point is, which
member of Congress, which

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:10%
member of the esteemed
political media, pick one,

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:10%
is willing to go in front of
a camera tomorrow and say,

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:10%
I don't think that a craft or
vehicle sitting over a SAC base

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:10%
turning off from missiles is
worthy of my news, attention,

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.590 align:middle line:10%
or a hearing on Capitol Hill.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:10%
Who's going to do that?

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.770 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: A fool would say that.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: They're
not going to do that,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:10%
because they're
not asked to do it.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
ask them to do it.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And so you see how this
chess game is being played.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Now the way it will
go, if this happens,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:14.210 align:middle line:84%
is that a hearing committee,
and we only need one,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
there's about eight committees
that will do, will say, fine.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:90%
We'll give it a go.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:90%
Give us 35 strong witnesses.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Just bring them here,
we'll interview them,

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.800 align:middle line:90%
we'll hold a hearing.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:84%
The moment the press learns
of that, that's the ball game.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: You see, the
media has its limits.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:84%
The media has been
involved over the years

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
in institutionalized
understandings.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:10%
We know about that.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.330 align:middle line:10%
There are many of them, some
of which we don't know about.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous
institutional understanding

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:84%
was, you didn't cover the
sex life of US Presidents.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.466 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And so it didn't
matter how many starlets that

00:13:52.466 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
JFK entertained in
the White House pool,

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.165 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't going to be discussed.

00:13:55.165 --> 00:13:56.125 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: While Jackie was out.

00:13:56.125 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Right.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Maybe even there.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.226 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: It
just didn't happen.

00:13:59.226 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Now we know that
eventually changed.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it
spectacularly changed.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And in my time in
Washington, I witnessed

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest media
frenzies in all of history.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, was
the Monica Lewinsky event,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and a scandal with the
President, which started off

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:90%
slow.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It was certainly
being pointed to.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.910 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, was
being relatively

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
handled by the Clintons,
until one day a friend of Miss

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Lewinsky, a woman by the
name of Linda Tripp--

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Goes public.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BASSETT: Well, she'd
already gone public.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:84%
But she showed up at
the reporters' office

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:90%
with a blue dress.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.865 align:middle line:90%
It hadn't been cleaned.

00:14:39.865 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The dress did it.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And all hell broke
loose, because at that point,

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:84%
as far as the media were
concerned, gloves come off.

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:50.481 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:50.481 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hard evidence.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: And the President
could have put the Third Army

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.041 align:middle line:10%
Corps around the White House,
and they would have blown

00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:10%
through it, like
they were Kleenex.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:10%
And that media frenzy
guaranteed that that

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:10%
would be revealed, that he
would apologize, et cetera.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:10%
Once a media frenzy
like that gets started,

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.660 align:middle line:10%
I don't care what
you've got, I don't

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:10%
care how deep it's
buried, I don't

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:10%
care what the security
clearance is, it's over.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:10%
I believe that once
the media knows

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:10%
that members of the Air
Force, distinguished

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:10%
members of the Air Force
and other high level

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:10%
people, an astronaut,
like Dr. Mitchell,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.570 align:middle line:10%
are going to go on the
Hill and raise your hand

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:10%
and under the penalty
of federal perjury

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:10%
speak about this issue,
as they have already,

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:10%
but this time in that
setting, they're going to say,

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:10%
that's it.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.434 align:middle line:90%
That's it!

00:15:39.434 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Now tell us.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And they're going
to go into full media frenzy.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, hopefully
before that point-- and this

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
is a message that I get out
in every interview that I do,

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:55.467 align:middle line:84%
and I do a lot-- if I'm an
adviser to the President,

00:15:55.467 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I would be saying to the
President, Mr. President,

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:90%
do not wait for that moment.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.875 align:middle line:84%
Do not wait for the press
to go into that state.

00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT:
Proactively move now.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yep.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And
what does that mean?

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.278 align:middle line:84%
Does it mean the
President can just

00:16:11.278 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
walk out in front of the West
Wing and say that ETs are here?

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:90%
No, he can't.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:90%
You want to know why?

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Because he hasn't got the
backing of the Pentagon.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't got any information.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.362 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't been briefed.

00:16:20.362 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He may
not know anything.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: He probably
knows they're here.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.486 align:middle line:84%
I know he knows
the ETs are here.

00:16:24.486 --> 00:16:25.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm almost certain of that.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:10%
But does he have the
evidence, the substance?

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Has he got the
support of the people

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:90%
that supposedly work for him?

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.946 align:middle line:90%
I don't think he does.

00:16:31.946 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:90%
It would be political suicide.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And so what does the
President have to do?

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.886 align:middle line:84%
What is the message we're
sending to the White House

00:16:36.886 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again?

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Send a representative
to the Pentagon

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to meet with their
representative privately

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:84%
to work out the
terms of disclosure.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:84%
What does the national
security structure

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.600 align:middle line:84%
that is tasked with
protecting this country

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.340 align:middle line:84%
need from me in
the post disclosure

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.050 align:middle line:90%
world, how this will be handled?

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:90%
What is your need?

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And here is what
I need from you.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to walk
out there and end this,

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:90%
I need to be backed up by you.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:90%
I need evidence.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.829 align:middle line:84%
I need some things I can
show the American people that

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.690 align:middle line:90%
will eliminate all doubt.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
Once that deal is struck,
disclosure can take place.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:90%
He needs to make that deal.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how troubled
his Presidency is.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what the
polling numbers are.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.860 align:middle line:84%
This idea that, let's wait for
maybe a more suitable President

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.060 align:middle line:90%
in 2016, is ridiculous.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.207 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely absurd.

00:17:32.207 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I know there are Republicans
that are going, oh, my god.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.165 align:middle line:84%
If he becomes the
disclosure president,

00:17:36.165 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
oh, he'll go down in history and
we got him where we want him.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.062 align:middle line:84%
Those people need
to leave government.

00:17:41.062 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:90%
They need to get out the way.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.853 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: See, I could see how
they would start this, Stephen.

00:17:44.853 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:84%
They would start with a news
conference, maybe some people

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:51.040 align:middle line:84%
from the Pentagon with the
President simply saying,

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:90%
this is a vast universe.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.562 align:middle line:84%
And maybe have a few
scientists there.

00:17:55.562 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Yeah.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sagan would
have been great.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And begin to talk about
the possibilities of life

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:90%
on all these other planets.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Sounds good.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And then say, and
good old planet Earth has been

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:90%
visited.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Now because of years of national
security and other things,

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.039 align:middle line:90%
we could not disclose.

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: We wanted
to, but we could not.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But that's
changed today.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:90%
And then off they go.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: All right, I'm
going to go you one better.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:24.040 align:middle line:90%
That's a good scenario.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:24.915 align:middle line:10%
I like that scenario.

00:18:24.915 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:10%
Let me tell you how I
think it's going to happen,

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:10%
since this is on tape, you see.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.972 align:middle line:10%
If it turns out that
way, I'm a genius, OK?

00:18:30.972 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:10%
[NOORY CHUCKLING]

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Here is how I think
it will take place.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.343 align:middle line:90%
We'll see how many points.

00:18:34.343 --> 00:18:36.272 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it would
happen on a Friday.

00:18:36.272 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
It'll be a Friday night,
somewhere around 7:30, 8:00.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Slow news day?

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: It has to be after
the people have gotten back

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:90%
from work on the West Coast.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
weekend is coming up.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's a slow news day.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:84%
The networks will be
giving very little notice.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It'll be 10, 15 minutes,
they'll be told,

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%
you need to bring your feed
online to the White House.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be an
announcement in the West Wing.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.076 align:middle line:90%
And they'll say, uh, but, no.

00:19:01.076 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:90%
You know, they do this now.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:90%
They go, no, no, no.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:84%
We got some good shows
going that night.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.580 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, oh, yes, you are.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:90%
This is an order, right?

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.325 align:middle line:90%
And so, boom.

00:19:10.325 --> 00:19:11.080 align:middle line:90%
They'll line up.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.150 align:middle line:90%
The President will walk out.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think he'll
make the announcement.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Politically, the
wise thing to do

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:90%
is, the President will walk out.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Alone?

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:21.980 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: Alone.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:10%
And he will say, my fellow
Americans, this evening you're

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.334 align:middle line:10%
going to learn some
extraordinarily

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:10%
important information.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That I just learned.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Maybe like that?

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.443 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: No, I don't
think he wants to do that.

00:19:33.443 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:90%
That's a little, little risky.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
But he'll say
important information.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And there's two things you
need to know from me tonight.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
One, I have fully authorized
this to take place.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And two, there is no immediate
risk to you or your country.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, they will
cut to another press conference

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:90%
held somewhere else.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And there, and they will have
assembled a group of people

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.655 align:middle line:84%
representing different
elements of our society--

00:20:04.655 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:84%
the military, the intelligence
services, religion, academia,

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.330 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:10%
People carefully
selected who also

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.149 align:middle line:10%
weren't given a lot of notice.

00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:10%
And they will be sitting there.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:10%
And then they're going
to select a person that's

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:10%
going to be the
quote, "spokesman

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:10%
or woman" for that
press conference.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.555 align:middle line:84%
And that person will
step to the podium.

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And that person will
make the announcement.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Because that will
de-politicize it, right?

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And take it to a
different place.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.254 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me
when I give out

00:20:36.254 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:84%
this scenario, who do you
think that person will be?

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Who's your best guess?

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm sticking with my
first choice, Michio Kaku.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
That's who, if
I'm the President,

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I ask to make that announcement
to the American people

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.520 align:middle line:90%
that night.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:10%
Now obviously the
President's going

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:10%
to get the legacy as the
disclosure president.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.810 align:middle line:10%
He authorized it.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But a neutral scientific
person makes the announcement.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, they will allow,
these members of this panel,

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.740 align:middle line:84%
to give a couple of minutes
from their perspective

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.670 align:middle line:90%
about the meaning of this.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And take a limited
number of questions

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.109 align:middle line:84%
with the understanding
that more--

00:21:12.109 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: More will come.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: More will come.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.170 align:middle line:90%
And it'll be over.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It might take a total of
about an hour and a half.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And they may or may not
close the banks on Monday,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.094 align:middle line:90%
following the weekend.

00:21:23.094 --> 00:21:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Or they may not.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:90%
It depends on how things go.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But the public
will have two days

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:84%
to digest that, have
a little barbecue,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:84%
drink a couple of beers, maybe
watch some football, whatever.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And then come Monday,
the new world begins.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I could
see Kaku saying,

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.804 align:middle line:84%
they've been coming here
since the beginning of time.

00:21:41.804 --> 00:21:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And he goes through his
little scenario there.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.685 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Who knows?

00:21:44.685 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How you're
a Type 1 civilization.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: He may do that.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:84%
He will say what
they want him to say.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But at that moment, the moment
that those words come out

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
of his mouth or the President's
mouth, in that instance,

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.900 align:middle line:84%
we are in the post
disclosure world.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Now Kaku, today,
doesn't seem to know about

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.554 align:middle line:90%
the ET presence.

00:22:06.554 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Actually, if you
listen to everything he says,

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:90%
he dances around.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He does
dance around that.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: He's said a
couple of interesting,

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.160 align:middle line:90%
provocative things.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He's
never been direct.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:14.595 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: No.

00:22:14.595 --> 00:22:15.414 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:15.414 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Sagan, actually, was
direct at one time,

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.131 align:middle line:90%
but then he backed away.

00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Sagan would have been the guy.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.275 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He would
have been the one.

00:22:20.275 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Back then.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He would
have been the one.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: So at that point,
we're in what we call After

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.497 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure, AD, as Richard
Dolan and Bryce Zabel put

00:22:28.497 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
in their book, "AD:
After Disclosure."

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.900 align:middle line:84%
We were in the post disclosure
world in that moment.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me tell
you, then the fun

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.130 align:middle line:84%
begins-- then things
get really interesting.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Maybe Neil
deGrasse Tyson pops in.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: I'm sure he
would love to be there,

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and if he doesn't get
invited, will be very upset.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:90%
This is my call.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.911 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how close I am to it.

00:22:47.911 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And you know mine.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: And you got yours.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:90%
We'll see how it works out.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But the-- ultimately,
I know this.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.810 align:middle line:10%
The government has had a
lot of time to plan this.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.532 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Will it
happen without this?

00:23:02.532 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Well, look.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:90%
It's inevitable.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure is going to
happen one way or the other,

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:06.716 align:middle line:90%
it's inevitable.

00:23:06.716 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The question is, whether it's
going to happen soon enough?

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I constantly

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:84%
mention in my interview, so
that hopefully the White House

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:84%
people will hear, and
I hope they hear it,

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
non-trivial matter,

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:25.120 align:middle line:84%
is that this is just one
move on the chessboard

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:90%
that PRG has executed.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
There's other pieces moving to
try to put them in the corner.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.062 align:middle line:90%
And at any moment--

00:23:32.062 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But this
is a great move.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: It is a great
move, but at any moment

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.425 align:middle line:84%
there's a number of heads of
state that could announce it

00:23:37.425 --> 00:23:39.086 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow, period, done!

00:23:39.086 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Which is
another question, Stephen.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Other countries, Peru,
Brazil, what are they doing?

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.227 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Let's go
higher up, Russia, China.

00:23:48.227 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: All right.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: There's countries
that are releasing files

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:51.933 align:middle line:90%
and doing a lot of things.

00:23:51.933 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
They're setting up entities
within their own Air Forces.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
These other
countries are already

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:00.580 align:middle line:84%
breaking away from
the truth embargo.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
They haven't made the decision
to preempt the United States,

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:84%
but believe me,
they're doing plenty.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And I assure you, that
Vladimir Putin and Hu Jingping,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:84%
the president of China, they
both know the political legacy,

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.510 align:middle line:90%
the geopolitical legacy here.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
They both know that it would
elevate their countries

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.890 align:middle line:84%
profoundly, in terms of their
position on the world stage.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you kind of look at the
actions of these two countries

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:84%
over the last 15
years, everything

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:84%
points to their efforts to
try to elevate their countries

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
on the world stage with Vladimir
being the most overt about it.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And here is the greatest
possible political legacy

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
of all time, and they
could announce it tomorrow.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:10%
And I have people
say, oh, no, no, no.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:10%
They would not do
that, because we

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.969 align:middle line:10%
know the United States
controls Vladimir.

00:24:46.969 --> 00:24:48.009 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: No, they would.

00:24:48.009 --> 00:24:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And controls
China-- they're our puppets.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, what
universe are you living in?

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Are you watching
any news at all?

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.954 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
advisers, probably,

00:24:57.954 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
in the White House
that are going,

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.560 align:middle line:84%
now, Mr. President,
don't worry, don't worry,

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:90%
everybody's on board.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:84%
This will happen when
it happens but you

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.064 align:middle line:90%
don't have to deal with it.

00:25:06.064 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Wrong!

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Wrong!

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Wrong!

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.240 align:middle line:84%
The geopolitical consequences
to the United States, which

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:84%
has led this truth
embargo since day one,

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and thus, has accumulated
all the baggage,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:21.310 align:middle line:84%
all the negatives, if it
doesn't disclose first,

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:84%
what will happen is another
nation gets all of the credit.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.607 align:middle line:84%
And we have to clean
up after the elephants.

00:25:28.607 --> 00:25:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yep.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.045 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: That's going to
be a geopolitical disaster

00:25:31.045 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:90%
for the United States.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They came forward,
but you still keep--

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.468 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:34.468 --> 00:25:38.946 align:middle line:84%
What, China goes down as the
great truth teller, right,

00:25:38.946 --> 00:25:41.070 align:middle line:84%
that told the greatest
truth to the world's people,

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.642 align:middle line:84%
the great truth
teller was China.

00:25:42.642 --> 00:25:44.100 align:middle line:84%
The United States
was still sitting

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.285 align:middle line:84%
there going, we just-- I
don't want to say anything.

00:25:46.285 --> 00:25:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We just don't, we don't
want to say anything.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:90%
We can't say-- I mean, please!

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:50.585 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: No comment.

00:25:50.585 --> 00:25:53.660 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: We have already
damaged our position worldwide

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:10%
enough; we don't need to
damage it any further.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.960 align:middle line:84%
This is an unbelievable
opportunity.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:84%
We earned the right-- this
nation earned the right--

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:84%
to execute and maintain
this truth embargo by virtue

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.590 align:middle line:84%
of the fact that we were
critical in defeating the Axis

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.340 align:middle line:84%
powers, and we were the
only nation strong enough

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:84%
to defend the West
against the Soviet threat.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.180 align:middle line:90%
We spent trillions to do it.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.862 align:middle line:90%
That's some serious dues.

00:26:21.862 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.194 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: We
earned that right.

00:26:24.194 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Now because of ineptitude and
a lot of political nonsense,

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:35.004 align:middle line:84%
we are not prepared to
take our right-- I think,

00:26:35.004 --> 00:26:35.795 align:middle line:90%
rightful position--

00:26:35.795 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We need
to go the distance.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: -- as the nation
that finally says, OK,

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:90%
it's done.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:84%
We are not alone
in the universe.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's deal with that.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you look
at the last 25 years,

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and you count all of
the things that America

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.550 align:middle line:84%
has lost because of
political ineptitude,

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.380 align:middle line:84%
we could spend five
shows on that, George.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: This is
becoming very uncomfortable.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Now look, as far
as I'm concerned,

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't care which nation
does it, ultimately.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.834 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is my country.

00:27:04.834 --> 00:27:05.958 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You want it done.

00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And I see the
value of the US being first.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But the value globally
doesn't matter.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's Russia or China
or Brazil or France or the UK,

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.684 align:middle line:90%
this embargo must end.

00:27:15.684 --> 00:27:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What about
the third scenario?

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:90%
You heard mine, we heard yours.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Mm, hm.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What about a United
Nations presence with Russia,

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:84%
with China, with
the United States?

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And that announcement, maybe
precipitated by the Citizens

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Hearing for Disclosure, but that
announcement comes from the UN,

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.266 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of takes the
heat off the President.

00:27:37.266 --> 00:27:39.640 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: Well, the Paradigm
Research Group has created

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.856 align:middle line:10%
a foundation called the
Citizenry Foundation,

00:27:41.856 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:10%
which is essentially
functional, has website,

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.105 align:middle line:10%
but it's not operating now,
citizenhearingfoundation.org.

00:27:46.105 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:10%


00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.914 align:middle line:10%
And its primary task,
which was, by the way,

00:27:50.914 --> 00:27:53.371 align:middle line:10%
given to it by the committee
members of the Citizen Hearing

00:27:53.371 --> 00:27:55.580 align:middle line:10%
on Disclosure, the
members of Congress,

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:10%
is to engage the UN
on a joint resolution.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.764 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a complex,
expensive process.

00:28:00.764 --> 00:28:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: You have to get
a number of things going

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.013 align:middle line:84%
in a number of countries,
because it has to come through

00:28:06.013 --> 00:28:06.790 align:middle line:90%
the head of state.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And certainly approaching
the UN is on the menu,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:84%
but that is a slow process,
a very slow process.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe the truth
embargo will last till then.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And we have other moves that
are more powerful right now.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But the UN needs
to get involved.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:10%
Look, in a perfect world,
in a more logical world,

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.550 align:middle line:10%
the UN is the logical venue.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:34.466 align:middle line:10%
>> NOORY: Place to be.

00:28:34.466 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:10%
>> BASSETT: Yeah, a
consortium of countries.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's the Federation.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:38.605 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: In a way.

00:28:38.605 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
the UN is severely

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.300 align:middle line:84%
damaged by the role it
played, essentially,

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.370 align:middle line:84%
as a buffer institution
on the Cold War.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:84%
The National Security
Council, the UN,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
was primarily a
Cold War mechanism.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.655 align:middle line:84%
It has never been allowed,
the UN, to be the UN.

00:28:54.655 --> 00:28:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This would be
a great boost for it.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: It would,
but unfortunately,

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:84%
there's so much baggage there
that I do not think enough

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.194 align:middle line:84%
nations would say,
let's use it for this.

00:29:04.194 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: Now if they had a
real consensus that they would

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.810 align:middle line:84%
like to revitalize the UN, then
this might be a wonderful way

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.476 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't rule it out, but
there's another problem.

00:29:15.476 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Going that route, being able
to put it together and not

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.210 align:middle line:84%
have it leak ahead of time
would be very difficult.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And it leaks ahead of time, and
you've got all this confusion.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.216 align:middle line:84%
A single nation can
do is just like that!

00:29:26.216 --> 00:29:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: Right.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's not going
to be any-- there's not

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.111 align:middle line:84%
going to be flags
put up, there's not

00:29:30.111 --> 00:29:31.900 align:middle line:84%
going to be the early
emails, there's not

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
going to be-- the President's
announcement is not

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.430 align:middle line:84%
going to be submitted to
the press ahead of time.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's just
going to be done.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: This is not the
kind of thing you do that.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, I think,
it's going to be one nation.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.663 align:middle line:84%
It could be a consortium
of three or four nations,

00:29:41.663 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:84%
but again, you've got the
problem of working out

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.120 align:middle line:84%
the details without
it getting out.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So, more likely-- Now once
it's out, if the UN is wise,

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:84%
it will move quickly to try
to become a part of this.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:84%
It's possible, however, that
in a post-disclosure world--

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:58.325 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't rule
this out-- the UN

00:29:58.325 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:84%
will be replaced by a
new global organization,

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:06.440 align:middle line:84%
created post-disclosure, without
all the baggage of the-- that

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.460 align:middle line:84%
the UN had to acquire
serving the world's people,

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:84%
because it did serve
the world's people

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and help protect us
from a nuclear war.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.155 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it can't, like
Moses, cross the river

00:30:18.155 --> 00:30:19.030 align:middle line:90%
to the Promised Land.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And we may see another
an organization form.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.275 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Think of the
possibilities, though,

00:30:22.275 --> 00:30:24.070 align:middle line:90%
if disclosure comes.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Because all these questions
that I would have would be,

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.190 align:middle line:90%
are they benevolent?

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to trade
technology with us?

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to
visit us publicly?

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to see them
on a regular basis now?

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Great questions--

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: A million questions.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: -- about
what could happen.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And what's going to
happen in the post-disclosure

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.690 align:middle line:84%
world-- here's
another prediction--

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.273 align:middle line:84%
is that once the
announcement is made,

00:30:45.273 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:84%
the media is fully
unleashed now, of course.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.110 align:middle line:84%
The media will
completely switch over

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.359 align:middle line:84%
to the public side,
because that's

00:30:52.359 --> 00:30:54.400 align:middle line:84%
where the money is, that's
where the ratings are.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: You know,
the idea that, oh, well,

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.920 align:middle line:84%
let's stand with the
government and help protect.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.480 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.313 align:middle line:90%
They're on our side.

00:31:00.313 --> 00:31:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, I know
we'll say, I told you so.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.361 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: There will
be a little of that.

00:31:04.361 --> 00:31:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: So essentially
what you'll have is you'll have

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.061 align:middle line:84%
the government, all
its institutions,

00:31:08.061 --> 00:31:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and all of their press
representatives essentially up

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.800 align:middle line:84%
against the entire American
populace and all of the media

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.000 align:middle line:84%
basically saying, now,
what else do you know?

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>> BASSETT: And it's going to
be a very intense struggle.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.169 align:middle line:10%
It's going to go on, in
which the government is going

00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:29.710 align:middle line:10%
to be trying to limit how much
they say and when they say it.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.668 align:middle line:10%
The public is going to
want everything at once,

00:31:31.668 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:10%
but ultimately, I believe, you
will have a flow of information

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.220 align:middle line:10%
that will slowly
fill up the truth

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.810 align:middle line:10%
barrel-- with certain
things withheld, ultimately.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:10%
There will be somethings
withheld indefinitely, perhaps.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.480 align:middle line:90%
But we'll know a great deal.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And we will be fully in
a post-disclosure world,

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.624 align:middle line:84%
and a part of that
era and that time.

00:31:51.624 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You keep doing
what you're doing, Stephen.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>> BASSETT: I shall.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:55.403 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Thank you.

00:31:55.403 --> 00:31:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Stephen Bassett.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.330 align:middle line:10%
This is fascinating.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:03.000 align:middle line:10%
And of course, keep
tuned for the Citizens

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.760 align:middle line:10%
Hearing on Disclosure.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure there'll be
more information coming.
