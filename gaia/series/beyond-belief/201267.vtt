>>GEORGE NOORY: Do we
have a celestial team

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:84%
of angels just
waiting to help us

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:90%
create our best life possible?

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Corin Grillo believes so.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.610 align:middle line:10%
She's the author of
"The Angel Experiment"

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:10%
and the founder of
the Angel Alchemy

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:10%
Academy, a trained
psychotherapist,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.290 align:middle line:10%
angel channeler,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:10%
Corin has also helped thousands
of people all over the planet

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:10%
go from angel curious
to angel empowered.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Corin, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.453 align:middle line:84%
>>CORIN GRILLO: Oh,
thank you for having me.

00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved with dealing

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:90%
with the angelic realm?

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Well--

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My God.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: --I know.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It probably
is my God, right?

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Essentially,
it is my God.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it really
happened abruptly.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.290 align:middle line:10%
It was not something
I was looking out for.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I really struggled a
lot with depression.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:90%
I had a really rough childhood.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And even though I managed to
somewhat keep my life together,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.110 align:middle line:84%
I really struggled hard, mostly
for the first three decades.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:90%
That long?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes, yes.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, back then
my only prayer was

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:90%
that that day would be my last.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:10%
And even though I had
a beautiful child,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.830 align:middle line:10%
and a wonderful
husband, and I had

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:10%
a house, and a great
education, and all of those

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.325 align:middle line:10%
"things," the recipes that--

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: For
happiness, they say.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: --for happiness that
are our culture teaches us,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:10%
it just got worse and
worse the older I got.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And I always had a
great way of presenting

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:90%
that I was OK on the outside.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
didn't know what

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:90%
I was actually struggling with.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But one day a friend of mine
bought me an angel healing,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:90%
an angel reading.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.747 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what that was.

00:02:04.747 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I just thought, oh,
let's go see a psychic.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know
that at the time,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I was drinking about a fifth
of tequila every two days.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.773 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I could throw them
back when I want to, right?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: So I was
definitely doing that.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With the lime and salt?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:90%
You did all that?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: I did it all.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:90%
I did it all.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:90%
So the tequila.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.938 align:middle line:84%
And I was on anti-depressants
and Adderall and just really--

00:02:28.938 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bad combination.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.522 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: --doing
everything I could.

00:02:31.522 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, doing everything I
could just to function.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.900 align:middle line:10%
And ironically, at the time--

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You were trying
to escape, not function.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Well, in my
mind, it was what I

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:90%
needed to wake up the next day.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:10%
And ironically, I was a
psychotherapist, right?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:10%
So I was--

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.042 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You were a
psychotherapist at the time--

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: At that time.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --taking a fifth
of tequila every other day--

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Anti-depressants--

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --anti-depressants--

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: --Adderall

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.963 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and meds,
Adderall, and all that?

00:02:58.963 --> 00:02:59.763 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes.

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah,
so that was really

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:90%
what I was having to deal with.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You obviously didn't
listen to your own advice.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: No, I didn't.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:90%
I didn't.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But was amazing is I
could give great advice.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I could see and support
so many people at the time.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
But when it came
to myself, I still

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:84%
had an incredibly
low self-esteem.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And really, the
demons from my past--

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
I had never really
fully coped with.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
coping, doing what I

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:84%
could to take the next
step in life and again,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
secretly wishing that
each day would be my last.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing pretty
dangerous things,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
maybe hoping I could at least
get hospitalized and catch

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:90%
a break.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And now, none of
this was conscious.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:90%
I was just going through it.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's what was
happening in reality.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I was working as a
county mental health counselor

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
rescuing gangbangers
off the street.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It was a high stress job and
really hard to feel successful.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Thankless, too.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Sadly.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.235 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Thankless,
but the people

00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:90%
have always been beautiful.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And I did it for the
people, but I was not taking

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.567 align:middle line:90%
care of this thing right here.

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So who bought
you an angel reading?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, a
good friend of mine.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
She was one of my best
friends at the time.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:90%
And it was my birthday.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So she didn't know what
I was going through--

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: --like
most people didn't.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to
this angel healing.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.925 align:middle line:84%
And right away the lady
started talking to me about--

00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
an angel healing?

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.217 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: So an angel
reading, angel healing--

00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
it was at the time.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's essentially
you go to a person.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And they open up the portal
between you and the angels.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And they started giving
messages and eventually went

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
into an energy healing
or an angel healing.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So right away, she
started telling me this--

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.932 align:middle line:84%
pretty amazing things about
myself that she shouldn't know

00:04:52.932 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and actually, nobody
knew, except--

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody knew but you.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.982 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: --for me.

00:04:55.982 --> 00:04:56.782 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:56.782 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And then I couldn't deny it.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.713 align:middle line:84%
I was like, well, I didn't
come here to talk about that.

00:05:01.713 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
But she wanted to talk
about it, so we did.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And so when we sat for
the energy healing,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I could really feel
something change in the room.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:84%
I could feel energy
or like electricity.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.643 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you believe
in angels prior to that?

00:05:16.643 --> 00:05:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I wouldn't say
I believed in angels.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:90%
I did not deny angels.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was a possibility
if you know what I mean.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle line:90%
So I was open to the notion.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know what I was
about to find out about angels.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And so when I left that session,
she said talk to the angels

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:90%
as if they're real.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.570 align:middle line:10%
And I said, OK,
I'll give it a shot.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.568 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt so much
better already, George.

00:05:40.568 --> 00:05:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I could feel a
difference in my body.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.015 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:05:43.015 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I felt better.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It worked
that fast on you?

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
thing about angels.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:90%
They work.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know that.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So she said talk to the
angels as if they're real,

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:90%
and that's what I did.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And almost right away,
incredible synchronicities

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:90%
started happening.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Wherever I look,
there's angel wings.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I remember saying, angels,
show me that you're real.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this truck drive by
with big angel wings on it.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was Angels
Laundry Service.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect timing, right?

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Right.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:10%
But it was happening
over and over.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:13.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Little messages
that were popping up.

00:06:13.945 --> 00:06:14.745 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's so easy
to discount these.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:10%
So in the beginning, I
was still like, OK, maybe

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:10%
that's really angels,
but maybe not.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And so a few days
of this went on.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And I started feeling
better and better.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And by day three, something even
more extraordinary happened.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Not only was I already
feeling better and happy

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the
synchronicities, but I

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.218 align:middle line:84%
was driving through the
hood in Pacoima in LA.

00:06:40.218 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:90%
I think you know where that is.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Know it well.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Home of Ritchie
Valens by the way.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Right.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I'm driving
through the hood.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And a bird dropped from the
sky, landed on the ground.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was on my way
to a client's house.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And the bird was
about pigeon size.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:90%
And I see the bird.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:90%
I drive around it.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And I notice it's got
this mangled wing.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's pushing itself
with the other arm

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%
or with the other wing.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what to do.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.055 align:middle line:10%
So I used my new trick,
which was talking to angels.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, angels, help
this bird, because I can't.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.972 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know anything
about birds, plus I'm on my way

00:07:14.972 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:90%
to a client's house.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Help this bird.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:22.318 align:middle line:84%
And as I drove around it, I
kept sending it some good juju.

00:07:22.318 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:10%
And as I look in
the rearview mirror,

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.040 align:middle line:10%
I saw the bird kind of shimmy
on the ground a little bit.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And I kept watching, so
I stopped the car again.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:90%
I kept watching.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And as I watched, I
saw a small bird jump

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:84%
up from the body of that bird,
probably about 2 or 3 inches,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:84%
about this big, jump up
from the body of the bird,

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.830 align:middle line:90%
fly away, then a second bird--

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.088 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: --jump up from the
body of the bird and fly away.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And then a third one
jumped off there.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
getting tuned in.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.085 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I don't know what
the heck was happening,

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:90%
but it was very notable.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't care that I was
in the middle of the hood.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.808 align:middle line:84%
I decided to get out
of the car and go look

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to see if the body of the
bird was still on the ground.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.160 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:10%
And I could feel the static
electricity and this--

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:10%
it's a word beyond love
that was enveloping me.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.762 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I was in
the presence of a miracle.

00:08:09.762 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I know I had just
witnessed [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doreen Virtue
is a clairvoyant doctor.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And she has been on the Gaia
program called "Inspirations."

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And she talked about where
angels may actually come from.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
- Where do those
voices come from?

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:90%
Where do these angels come from?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
- Well, in the ultimate
spiritual truth, we're one.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
spirit, one love.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:90%
We're one with the creator.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.020 align:middle line:90%
We're one with angels.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But in this world of separation
and illusion that we're in,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
these guides come in as
connectors, as messengers.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what angels
mean, after all.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they help us to bridge
the world of 100% love, which

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:90%
is where we're really from.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I define God as.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And then our world that has
a duality of fear and love--

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.740 align:middle line:84%
the angels are the
bridge between the two.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
- Because we live in a
physical dimension, what

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:84%
about this physical
dimension that we're in--

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.670 align:middle line:84%
has that polarity
of fear and love?

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:90%
- It's the density.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's the original
ego that said,

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.548 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be cool
if I could be God

00:09:13.548 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:90%
and I could be in charge?

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a teenage
kid who runs away from home

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and gets their own
apartment, but wants

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:90%
parents to still pay for it.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what the ego is.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:84%
- So it's reveling
with ourselves.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It's being a rebellion
against ourself.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:90%
- The ego wants to be God.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the ego wants
us to worship fear

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and gives us all
sorts of scenarios,

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.725 align:middle line:84%
including thinking
that other people are

00:09:34.725 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
worse than you or other
people are better than you.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the main thing it
does with level confusion.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:84%
- I love how you bring in
the psychology with what

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.233 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
with the angelic realm.

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Because it makes
it so practical.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, it brings
it to a grounded reality.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that was our own
Lisa Garr with Doreen Virtue.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:10%
What do you think
of that, the fact

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:10%
that where angels may come
from these other dimensions?

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I do agree that they
come from other dimensions,

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.507 align:middle line:84%
or that the original
source is God or creator

00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:07.840 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: And then
from that point,

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
it begins to separate,
separate, separate

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:90%
into different emanations.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:10%
And so angels are one
of the beautiful beings

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:10%
that have come from that.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Something else that
was interesting

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
is that there's angels
that really are here

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:84%
to connect us with source,
connect us with love,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and connect us with our own
sovereign truth as a divinity

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But I also have a
different insight

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:84%
about the dark side or
the demons, if you will,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that are the polar
opposite of angels.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:10%
And so one of the
things I have been shown

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:10%
is that sometimes it's not
just like the Bible says,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:10%
and that I believe that there
is, in a sense, a grand plan,

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.080 align:middle line:10%
and that those energies
were originally designed

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:10%
to help separate us, to keep
us separate from spirit,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:10%
from God, but not in a bad way.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's so that we could
experience the other.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And so you need a
different energy in there

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:84%
to make it a separation
between source and the other.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
there's a plan for--

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: --all of that.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the darkness
has gone out of control.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:84%
It's darkness gone
wild kind of thing.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Your book is called
"The Angel Experiment."

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:10%
And it's a 21-day
experimental guide to what?

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Guide to connect
with angels that can help you

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:10%
connect with light and source.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why does
it take 21 days?

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.353 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we do it in two?

00:11:47.353 --> 00:11:48.153 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Right.

00:11:48.153 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:10%
And so it's a 21-day
practice so that we

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:10%
can learn how to really
dig into a daily ritual

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:10%
to help open up our
lives to the beauty

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:10%
and to the love that is
available to all of us.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.670 align:middle line:10%
And it was through
my daily practice

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:10%
that I was able to
really integrate

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:10%
and activate my own
life, my own freedom

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:10%
and through the daily practice
and the work that I do,

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:10%
that now thousands of
people are doing and finding

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:10%
that the reality
of angels is real.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a philosophy,
or a theory, or a mythology.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the experiment?

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: The experiment is
sitting daily with an open mind

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and walking through these
exercises and practices

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:84%
that I put in the
book that work.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And so in the beginning, it's
an invocation and a prayer.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:10%
And then I walk you
through exercises

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:10%
where angels can come in and
start the energy healing, which

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:10%
was so essential for me.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what dialed
me into the angel world

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:90%
and to miracles.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of my
favorite movies--

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:84%
"It's a Wonderful Life"
with Jimmy Stewart.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:10%
And it's a movie
about he was a banker

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.270 align:middle line:10%
and something went
horribly wrong.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:10%
And he wanted to kill himself.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:10%
And he was ready to jump
into an icy, frigid river.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:90%
And he's standing on the bridge.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:90%
And he sees an angel drowning.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:84%
He didn't think it was
an angel, of course.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And he jumps in and
he saves this angel

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:84%
from drowning, who was
pretending to be drowning,

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.630 align:middle line:84%
so George Bailey
you could save him.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:90%
And it was an amazing story.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at
the movie in order

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:90%
to really appreciate an angel.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.166 align:middle line:10%
But do we all have
guardian angels?

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:26.850 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Yes, so far
everyone I've seen.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:10%
Even the, quote unquote, "worst"
people out there have angels.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:10%
And it's really just a
matter of whether or not

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:10%
we're going to listen to the
beautiful voice inside of us,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:10%
the one that's guiding
us to have a better life,

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:10%
or to set ourselves free, or
to break out of whatever prison

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:10%
we're in, whether it's a
financial prison, a health

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:10%
prison, an emotional prison.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:90%
But, yes, we all have guardians.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And we all have usually
at least one protector,

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:84%
an angel that's
there to protect us,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and then another one
that's more nurturing,

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:90%
that's comforting us.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do we summon them?

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Or are they always there?

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: They're always there.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what I didn't know.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:90%
They are always there.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're ready
to work for us.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, it's going to
be up to us and our free will

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:90%
to invite them in.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of different
ways to talk to angels.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.120 align:middle line:84%
You can do casually all day
long, just you're driving.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I like also-- the
most powerful way

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned how
to speak with angels,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
communicate with angels is
through ritual and invocation.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And that really opens a portal
between you and the divine.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Prayer?

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Same thing?

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.122 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Prayer and invocation
are a little different.

00:14:31.122 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Prayer is like,
help me, help me.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
And invocation is more--

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Say that again.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Help me.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You sound like we're
at a revival some where.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.558 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: That's what I mean.

00:14:41.558 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- but prayer
has sometimes

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.900 align:middle line:84%
a certain energy that's
more desperate sometimes.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:10%
An invocation is like
you as a magician

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:10%
standing, embracing your own
divine nature and activating,

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:10%
calling on a higher
power still, but doing

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:10%
it to help support and activate
something inside of you that's

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:10%
powerful and potent.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:10%
And that's the big difference
that I found over the years

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:10%
in working in this way is
becoming your own ceremonialist

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.830 align:middle line:10%
as opposed to depending on
someone else standing up

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:10%
on a pulpit to be the
ceremonialist for you.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.870 align:middle line:10%
I feel we have to bring this
work into our own lives,

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:10%
and create a sacred place, and
start it inside of our lives

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:10%
on the daily to
really invite it in.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And angels take
different forms and shapes

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:35.520 align:middle line:84%
of other beings in order to get
you to accept what's happening.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I had a story where
an individual was basically

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.510 align:middle line:90%
committing suicide.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.440 align:middle line:84%
He called me up on my radio
show in St. Louis years ago.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I was done.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:90%
George, I was done.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to find
the place that I

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:90%
was going to shoot myself.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And so I got in my car.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:90%
And I drove for about an hour.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And I saw on the side of a
road a little lake with ducks

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:90%
hitting it and coming out.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:10%
And I said that's
where I wanted to die.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:06.690 align:middle line:90%
And I went there.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.362 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little
bench right by the lake.

00:16:09.362 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to
sit there on the bench

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:90%
and shoot myself in my head.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I was depressed about my
life, my job, my girlfriend.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was working for me.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:90%
And he was ready to do it.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said while I was there,
this old farmer comes by

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:90%
and sits down next to me.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's wearing his coveralls
and things like that.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:90%
And the guy wouldn't shut up.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:84%
He's talking to me for an
hour about everything at life,

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:90%
his corn stocks, all this.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.090 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
I felt so good.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:90%
I went back to St. Louis.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.300 align:middle line:90%
He made me feel good.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And I got a new job,
got a new relationship.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:90%
I felt great.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:52.560 align:middle line:84%
A year later, I decided I
want to go back to that farmer

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:90%
and thank him.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.830 align:middle line:90%
He saved my life.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't get his full name.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:84%
All he knew was he
was in a little town.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:03.000 align:middle line:90%
So he said the barber will know.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:90%
Got to.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:90%
So he goes to the barber shop.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:07.234 align:middle line:84%
And there are a couple
of guys in there

00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:90%
that the barber was working on.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, excuse me, sir,
but I was here a year ago.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm
looking for this guy.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.930 align:middle line:90%
He looks like this.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, you
want to go to the house

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:90%
on the top of the hill.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Talk to his daughter.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said the way he
talked to me-- it sounded

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:90%
like something had happened.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I
went to the house.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:90%
I knocked on the door.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:90%
This lady comes.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, excuse
me, but I wanted

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:84%
to thank your father
for something.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.420 align:middle line:90%
The barber told me about you.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:90%
A year ago, he saved my life.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And she said stop right there.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Dad died 15 years ago.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.785 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Oh, goodness.

00:17:52.785 --> 00:17:53.585 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:17:53.585 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Angels do
that, don't they?

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yes, they're very
creative from what I found.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why are you crying?

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Why not?

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:02.708 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful story.

00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:04.005 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great story.

00:18:04.005 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: It's a
beautiful story.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And in my new
career after moving

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:84%
from being a
psychotherapist, now

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:84%
into being essentially
an angel advocate

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
or as angel ambassador,
I am in a unique position

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:84%
to really hear so many beautiful
stories just like that.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many people out
there that are suffering just

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.600 align:middle line:90%
like that man.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And we have so much
love and support.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:90%
And the fact--

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't know
if I should hug you.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:90%
You're making me cry.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's so much
of what my book is about,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:90%
my work is about.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And it really touches
me-- this story.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so many people
out there right now, George,

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
that don't know how
loved they are and don't

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:84%
know that just this moment could
be the moment where everything

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.020 align:middle line:90%
turns around.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Regina Meredith spoke
with channeler Joan Walker

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:90%
about communicating with angels.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:10%
- It's true.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:10%
But most people say,
oh, that's all cool.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:10%
But once they get there, I don't
know how to hear them anyway.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.680 align:middle line:10%
That's probably the most
common retort to that, is--

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:10%
- Exactly.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.813 align:middle line:10%
- --how am I supposed to know
what they're saying to me?

00:19:15.813 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:10%
And that's why when we--

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:10%
when I was thinking about
this topic, I thought,

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.030 align:middle line:10%
why not ask the guides
how we're supposed--

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:10%
and rather than
us telling people

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:10%
our particular method
of connecting with them,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.565 align:middle line:10%
why not ask them on the other
side how we best reach them?

00:19:31.565 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:10%
And it seems like a
great conversation.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.415 align:middle line:10%
- It is a great conversation,
but it's a very individualized

00:19:37.415 --> 00:19:38.215 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:19:38.215 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:10%
- Yes.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.580 align:middle line:10%
- And it isn't taken lightly.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean that
everyone has the ability

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:10%
to be a channel, or a mystic
in some way, a medium.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.080 align:middle line:10%
But you do have the
ability to communicate

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:10%
with the source of who you are.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:10%
And this takes private time.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people
aren't willing to do that.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.040 align:middle line:10%
- It's a process.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:10%
- They get into the magic of it.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:10%
And it's not.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:10%
It's about building
a relationship--

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:10%
- Absolutely.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.280 align:middle line:10%
--just like you do
with a close friend.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:10%
- Yes.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:10%
- So that's the first
and most important thing.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:10%
- It is.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And everybody gets
there a different way.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:90%
- Exactly.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And it may be five
minutes out of your day.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:10%
It may be 10 minutes, whatever.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.560 align:middle line:10%
- It may take you 20 years to
create the relationship itself.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:10%
- Really, in these
times, not really.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.490 align:middle line:10%
If you are diligent, it
happens very quickly.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, that doesn't mean that you
hear voices, you see visions.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.950 align:middle line:10%
But you will have inspiration.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.040 align:middle line:10%
You will have thoughts
that come to you.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:10%
It's important that you write
those down and then look back

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:10%
on it.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.360 align:middle line:10%
Wait a week or two weeks
and then read your journal.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.490 align:middle line:10%
There's a wealth of information.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:10%
The ideas and
thoughts come to you.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.032 align:middle line:10%
Feelings come to you.

00:21:06.032 --> 00:21:07.115 align:middle line:10%
You have to pay attention.

00:21:07.115 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sometimes, Corin,
you ask for an angel

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.770 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't appear.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:10%
It's not that it doesn't appear.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:10%
It's just that our
awareness isn't such

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.230 align:middle line:10%
that we're seeing them all the
time, right here, right now.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:10%
So we may not actually
be aware of them.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:10%
But they're always
right here, right now.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:10%
And the more that you
increase your sensitivity

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:10%
to things like energy or the
presence of energy, the more

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:10%
that you can actually
experience them.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, we may not always
get what we ask for.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes we don't
ask for the right things.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes these
things take a while.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:10%
But the work that I've
done over the years

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:10%
in working with angels
is that every time

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.870 align:middle line:10%
you communicate with an
angel, it doesn't go unheard.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- it's processing.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the easiest way
to communicate with an angel?

00:22:01.055 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: The
easiest way is just

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:10%
to communicate with
an angel like they're

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:10%
just right here, right now
with you, just as a friend,

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.270 align:middle line:10%
like she was saying.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:10%
What I didn't know is
that they're not off

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.155 align:middle line:10%
in heaven, playing harps
and doing all that stuff.

00:22:14.155 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they
don't all have wings.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.822 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: No, they don't.

00:22:16.822 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:10%
Although, I've seen
some with wings.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:10%
But however they look, sometimes
it's just a sparkle of light,

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.990 align:middle line:10%
or a presence, or a feeling.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.360 align:middle line:90%
But they're always there.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to
just talk to them.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Is just they're right
there, right now.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:10%
And you can actually
ask them to show you

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.300 align:middle line:10%
or to help you feel them.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.923 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times, you
can have them touch you,

00:22:39.923 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:84%
or to hold your
hand, or whatever.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice a
change in energy.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
always there to help us?

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, sometimes it
doesn't feel like it.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:90%
But, yes, they are.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, sometimes
there's some difficult times.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who sends them to us?

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:00.660 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Well, I think we
ask for them, or we have them.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:10%
So we can have them consciously
come to us by asking for them.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:10%
But the source of all
that is-- creator, God,

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.590 align:middle line:10%
whatever it is, whatever
term you believe in.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.590 align:middle line:84%
What I know is that they've
been here before the Bible.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.740 align:middle line:84%
They've been here way
longer than religion.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:10%
And we see even
in cave paintings,

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:10%
signs of beings,
whatever you want

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:10%
to call them, here supporting
us, teaching us, and guiding

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:10%
us.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:10%
So just depending on your
framework, they're here.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Whoever sent them,
we can't be sure.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:90%
You can call it God.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
they're here to help us.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the angels
that you've dealt with

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:90%
are benevolent.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever come across angels
that aren't, the fallen ones?

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I think when I tuned into the
angel world or they gave me

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.952 align:middle line:84%
a little cosmic smack--
hey, we're real--

00:23:55.952 --> 00:23:57.660 align:middle line:84%
it took me a while to
really clue in that

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:90%
the other guys were real, too--

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:90%
the dark--

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The darker side.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: --the darkness
or the darker side.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So in working with
clients, back when

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a lot
of one-on-one work,

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I would start looking
at them intuitively,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:15.203 align:middle line:84%
and see some presence
with them, and start work

00:24:15.203 --> 00:24:16.620 align:middle line:84%
with the archangels
and the angels

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.995 align:middle line:84%
to do some clearing
work on them.

00:24:17.995 --> 00:24:18.795 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:24:18.795 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:90%
I do believe that they're real.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:90%
They're happening.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.138 align:middle line:90%
And they are very sneaky.

00:24:23.138 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:90%
Because they don't show--

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: --up with-- well,
they don't show up with horns

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.950 align:middle line:84%
on their head with
a goatee and a--

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you think
they're the good ones--

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: --trident.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --right?

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, right.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:31.825 align:middle line:84%
No, they don't
show up like that.

00:24:31.825 --> 00:24:34.290 align:middle line:84%
They come to us
through our mind.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:10%
And they start punking
us in the thoughts

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:10%
that we're having
and start really

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:10%
getting us to believe the
negative thoughts that we're

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:10%
having and propagate
the negativity

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:10%
and the fear-based stuff.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.330 align:middle line:10%

on Gaia's Legacy program

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:84%
about some of our significant
others and the ways

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.880 align:middle line:10%
- It is a common
human experience

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:10%
after the death of a
love one for people

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:10%
to have some sort of
significant message

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:10%
from the departed person.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:10%
And there are several
variants of this.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Some people will say that in the
middle of the day when they're

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
in full waking
consciousness, the apparition

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:84%
of the departed person will
just appear in their home.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:30.900 align:middle line:10%
Other people will say
that they experience

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.960 align:middle line:10%
an apparition of the
deceased loved one,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:10%
while they are lying in
bed on the verge of sleep.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Not asleep, but in
that drifty situation.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.710 align:middle line:10%
They see the apparition standing
often at the foot of the bed.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:10%
And a third type in which
people will say that--

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:10%
they have to call this a
dream, because they were asleep

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:10%
when it occurred,
but that it didn't

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:10%
have the quality of a dream.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.420 align:middle line:10%
It actually seemed
to be a visitation

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:10%
with a departed loved one.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:10%
So those are the three
main ways of people

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:14.070 align:middle line:10%
receiving communications
from dead relatives.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:18.570 align:middle line:10%
In our world, this
happens spontaneously.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But in the ancient
Greek and Roman worlds,

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.720 align:middle line:84%
there were ways of actually
bringing these experiences

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So they had institutions
where people

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:84%
would go to have
visionary encounters

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.060 align:middle line:90%
with their departed loved ones.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:33.900 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.608 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you had
experience, Corina,

00:26:35.608 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:90%
with our departed loved ones?

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Oh, of course.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.333 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:26:39.333 --> 00:26:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about that.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: When you
work with angels,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.550 align:middle line:10%
especially when I'm working
or when I've worked on other

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:48.690 align:middle line:10%
people, often angels
will bring over--

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:10%
will bring through a
departed loved one,

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:55.740 align:middle line:10%
especially if this person really
needs to make that connection.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.980 align:middle line:10%
So, yes, I've had experiences
with my own mother

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.090 align:middle line:10%
who passed several years ago--
or decades ago, actually.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:90%
And so, yeah.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:10%
What's amazing since
the miracle that

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.310 align:middle line:10%
happened for me is that my
spiritual senses got activated.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:10%
And then I was guided to
teach other people, also,

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:10%
about how to open up
their intuitive senses.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And so what's amazing
is that we are hardwired

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.290 align:middle line:84%
to make these spiritual
connections with the divine,

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.930 align:middle line:84%
with angels, with
departed loved ones.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:10%
And until we really acknowledge
that magical part of us,

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:10%
these "spiritual gifts"
that I don't feel

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:10%
are gifts-- they're actually--
we're born with them.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.600 align:middle line:90%
They just atrophy over time.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.780 align:middle line:84%
The more that you really learn
and open up to these realities,

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.630 align:middle line:84%
the more that they become
quite obvious to you.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What do
you say to somebody

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:10%
who has had some
significant others

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:50.130 align:middle line:10%
pass, but they haven't
communicated with them

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.640 align:middle line:10%
and they're all depressed?

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.140 align:middle line:10%
My brother who died two years
ago and he's not contacting me.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.190 align:middle line:10%
What do you say to them?

00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.560 align:middle line:10%
Well, usually, I work
with the archangel.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:10%
So Archangel Azrael
sometimes helps

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:10%
with opening up grief and
helping people heal from grief.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.360 align:middle line:10%
But it's really about
getting the person

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:10%
to slow down and get out of the
pain mind, back into the love

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:10%
field.

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:17.368 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
our people still live.

00:28:17.368 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:10%
Even though their bodies
have transitioned,

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:10%
we still access
them through love.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.540 align:middle line:10%
And often, people
can start feeling

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.430 align:middle line:10%
the presence of
their own loved ones

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:10%
or get direct communication.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.820 align:middle line:10%
I think the key for
all of us is learning

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.700 align:middle line:10%
how to trust our intuition,
and trust these thoughts,

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.960 align:middle line:10%
and trust these feelings.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.150 align:middle line:10%
And often, spirit angels
will get our attention

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:10%
the more that we engage them.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And they will bring
synchronicities, or miracles,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.170 align:middle line:84%
or birds, or nature, or whatever
it is in your frameworks

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:84%
so that you learn how
to trust even more.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they send us
signs like numbers or things

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:52.670 align:middle line:84%
we look at, just to
say, there they are?

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:54.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.600 align:middle line:10%
And departed loved
ones will do that.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:10%
And angels will
definitely do that.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:10%
That's a huge part
of my work is--

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:10%
the experiment is you
tell me if they're

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:10%
real after these 21 days.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:10%
Because what happens for people
is incredible synchronicities.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.200 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Doors open.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Crazy doors open.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's so fun.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.360 align:middle line:10%
It's fun to get the feedback,
and to read the emails,

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.850 align:middle line:10%
or to see people light
up our community boards

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.620 align:middle line:10%
with the cool things that
happen for them along the way.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:10%
So that's what's so
fun about this work.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:10%
I didn't learn about angels
because I read it in a book.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I've learned because they made
their presence known to me.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.422 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
it's been my mission

00:29:27.422 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:84%
to teach other people how to
open up their eyes properly

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.040 align:middle line:84%
so that they can see the
divine footprints that they're

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:90%
leaving behind.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And with
some of these signs--

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:84%
for example, let's
say your departed

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:43.250 align:middle line:90%
loved one was born on April 8.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you're driving,

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.310 align:middle line:90%
thinking of the person.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:90%
You're sad.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.980 align:middle line:90%
You want to communicate.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And you see a
driver's license plate

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:84%
or a license plate on a car
that says 4-8 or something.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.118 align:middle line:90%
Are those signs?

00:29:57.118 --> 00:29:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Oh, absolutely.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And each person knows
more than anything.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:10%
It's not just what happens.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:10%
It's a feeling that you get.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.710 align:middle line:10%
You make that connection.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we
need to learn to trust

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:10%
is the feeling that comes
along with the event.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.920 align:middle line:90%
So, absolutely.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I definitely had one of those
happen with my own mother.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was a license plate.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's cool
when it happens.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: It was
a license plate.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying mom, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you see a billboard
or something like that.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And the license plate
that had numbers.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.457 align:middle line:90%
And then the middle was mom.

00:30:25.457 --> 00:30:27.410 align:middle line:10%
And I was like, oh, hi, mom.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:31.760 align:middle line:10%
And I had an amazing experience
happen with one of my clients.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.160 align:middle line:10%
We were doing-- in the middle
of a session and my phone--

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.868 align:middle line:10%
I was playing this
certain kind of music.

00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:37.880 align:middle line:10%
My phone kept on
switching to ABBA.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.920 align:middle line:10%
And I mean, just by
itself, switching to ABBA.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.962 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Dancing Queen."

00:30:40.962 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I know, which
I'm like, OK, let's boogie.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it was just
a glitch in my phone.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.842 align:middle line:84%
And then so it happened
like three times.

00:30:47.842 --> 00:30:49.550 align:middle line:10%
So, finally, I just
slowed down and asked

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.350 align:middle line:10%
if there's anybody else here.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.330 align:middle line:10%
And so I saw this
beautiful blonde woman

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:10%
who looked like the
lead singer of ABBA.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.050 align:middle line:10%
And I started
describing her to her.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:10%
She's like, oh, that's my mom.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And so she said,
yeah, she loved ABBA.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.460 align:middle line:90%
And she looks like ABBA.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How cool.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: I know.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:04.660 align:middle line:90%
So cool, right?

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, the coolest part
was that her session

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.880 align:middle line:90%
was on her mom's birthday.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:10.955 align:middle line:90%
So she's like, oh, my gosh.

00:31:10.955 --> 00:31:12.377 align:middle line:90%
It's my mom's birthday today.

00:31:12.377 --> 00:31:13.460 align:middle line:90%
She wants to have a party.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So she came because she wanted
to party with her daughter

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.420 align:middle line:90%
on her birthday.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people
report seeing 111 or 11:11

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.120 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:90%
They'll look at clocks--

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Oh, for sure.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --or just
wherever they are.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:25.810 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:26.810 align:middle line:90%
What's the significance?

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot
of theories about that.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say is
that any time there's

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:38.060 align:middle line:84%
number frequencies and multiple
numbers coming around you all

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.660 align:middle line:84%
the time, there's a
universal resonance.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.730 align:middle line:84%
That's like you're in a
harmonic of the universe.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And so 111 is often seen as
a portal towards a new entry

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.255 align:middle line:10%
point of life.

00:31:51.255 --> 00:31:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
theories and a lot

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:90%
of different frameworks on that.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
have different meanings

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.820 align:middle line:90%
of different numbers like 444.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:90%
They say it's an angel number.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I stay away from like, let's
all have to define something.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:07.580 align:middle line:10%
I much prefer to put the power
back into the individual's hand

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.430 align:middle line:10%
and ask questions like,
what does that mean for you?

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.778 align:middle line:84%
And guide them into
feeling into the truth

00:32:12.778 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:90%
that they're getting fed.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Because if you stop
in those moments

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.387 align:middle line:84%
and you ask spirit or you
ask your higher self, hey,

00:32:18.387 --> 00:32:19.220 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.775 align:middle line:90%
You'll get an answer.

00:32:20.775 --> 00:32:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, it is.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:23.600 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible when
you see those numbers.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost
laughable, because you

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.020 align:middle line:90%
know something is happening.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.820 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.020 align:middle line:10%
So that happens to you?

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, all the time.

00:32:31.135 --> 00:32:32.690 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:90%
I see primarily the 11:11.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a digital
clock in my studio,

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:84%
back in Los Angeles
for my radio show.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on the air at 10
o'clock PM to 2:00 AM.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:90%
And I got to tell you.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
At 11 o'clock-- and it
even reads seconds--

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.834 align:middle line:90%
I'll see 11, 11, 11, 11.

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:51.042 align:middle line:90%
Bang, bang ,bang, bang, bang.

00:32:51.042 --> 00:32:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Oh, wow.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's miraculous.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just feel
for you, that's

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
just validation you're
doing the right thing.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.790 align:middle line:84%
You're in the right
place at the right time.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.540 align:middle line:84%
You're doing the right
work for you, which

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.510 align:middle line:90%
is really, really obvious.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Angels--
do they have names?

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah,
sometimes they do.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So the first angel that I was
aware of-- that was my guardian

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:90%
angel--

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Stanley.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stanley was his name?

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Right.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.280 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.680 align:middle line:90%
Hey, look, I was judging, too.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stanley?

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: I was judging, too.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, you can't do
anything better than that?

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, Stanley.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:22.730 align:middle line:90%
And so here's the thing.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:90%
I was like, Stanley?

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Are you sure it's Stanley?

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And then so I'm driving
down the street.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:26.950 align:middle line:90%
And I look over.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's Stanley's
Donuts right there.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a
validation that-- yes.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's an archangel?

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:36.185 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: An archangel are
the heavies, the big cheeses.

00:33:36.185 --> 00:33:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Michaels,
the Gabriels?

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.300 align:middle line:84%
So there is the main four
that are noted in the Bible.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.110 align:middle line:84%
There's others noted
in older ancient texts.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:49.280 align:middle line:10%
But how I was shown
this by spirit

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.570 align:middle line:10%
is that if you imagine
that archangels are giant

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:10%
and they wear these
beautiful robes.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.590 align:middle line:10%
When they open up their
robe, then there's

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.200 align:middle line:10%
all these other angels
in there that are still

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.880 align:middle line:10%
maintaining their frequency.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.010 align:middle line:84%
So Archangel Michael
is a warrior.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And he stamps down
darkness and evil and fear.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.170 align:middle line:10%
And so when he
opens up his robes,

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:14.510 align:middle line:10%
the legions of angels that help
to battle some of those darker

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.293 align:middle line:10%
energies go out and
wrap around the world.

00:34:17.293 --> 00:34:19.460 align:middle line:10%
And those could include our
guardian angels as well.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, talking
about evil, back in 2014,

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.560 align:middle line:10%
I interviewed Laura Lee.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
the difference

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.410 align:middle line:90%
between angels and demons.

00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:30.199 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:39.810 align:middle line:10%
- What's the difference between
an angel and something evil--

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.810 align:middle line:10%
a demon, for example?

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:43.810 align:middle line:10%
- What's the difference?

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:10%
- Is there a difference?

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.328 align:middle line:10%
They're both spirits, right?

00:34:46.328 --> 00:34:47.620 align:middle line:10%
- I think they're both spirits.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:10%
And they're all
part of the plan.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:10%
I think the darker
entities are there

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:56.050 align:middle line:10%
to help us remember
there is a light.

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:58.210 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes I think
they all work together,

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:01.412 align:middle line:10%
so we recognize it's our light.

00:35:01.412 --> 00:35:03.370 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you've
heard that quote before,

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:10%
but I think Marianne
Williamson said it

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.250 align:middle line:10%
so brilliantly that "It's
not our darkness that we're

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.210 align:middle line:10%
most frightened of.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:12.813 align:middle line:10%
It's our light that
we're scared of."

00:35:12.813 --> 00:35:14.480 align:middle line:10%
- That's because we
don't understand it.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:90%
- We don't.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.535 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't
understand it, do we?

00:35:17.535 --> 00:35:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: No, we don't.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, should we?

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Do we need to know about the
dark forces, about the demons?

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I don't
think you have to.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a wise
thing to understand.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the way that they
influence can be so sneaky.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And so suicidal
people, people who

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.060 align:middle line:84%
suffer a lot with
depression, anxiety,

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.100 align:middle line:84%
or who have night terrors,
and they wonder why.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.900 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.660 align:middle line:10%
A lot of-- I've seen it
happen over and over again,

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:49.528 align:middle line:10%
where once we do a clearing with
some of these dark energies,

00:35:49.528 --> 00:35:51.070 align:middle line:10%
that they just
magically feel better.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
they're not suicidal.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's just
important to be aware.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I think there's even a
lot of spiritual people

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.040 align:middle line:84%
who want to deny the
reality of the dark.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.843 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really dangerous.

00:36:02.843 --> 00:36:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where
the darkness comes.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:06.190 align:middle line:90%
It comes through ignorance.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Be careful of
things you wish for.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.530 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Right.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, with
these demonic forces,

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:19.690 align:middle line:84%
what about people who
dabble with Ouija boards?

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't
that open up a portal?

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:26.160 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Well, I think just
being alive opens up a portal.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.112 align:middle line:10%
And Ouija boards-- yeah, sure.

00:36:28.112 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:10%
They can open you up
to the spirit realm.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.237 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't necessarily have
to be negative entities coming

00:36:32.237 --> 00:36:33.602 align:middle line:10%
through, but it can.

00:36:33.602 --> 00:36:36.060 align:middle line:10%
I feel like people are misguided
when they think it's just,

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.830 align:middle line:10%
oh, Tarot cards are
going to open it up.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Really, being alive
is going to open us up

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.480 align:middle line:90%
to dark energy and dark forces.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
these mass murders,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.250 align:middle line:84%
or when you look
in the news and you

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
see the mug shots of
people, and you really

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.010 align:middle line:84%
look into their eyes,
that's a demonic possession.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty sure they
weren't rocking the Ouija board

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:90%
right before those.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.080 align:middle line:90%
They're just being humans.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And for one reason
or another, we

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.340 align:middle line:84%
can be susceptible and
channels, both to the darkness

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.140 align:middle line:90%
and to the light.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.333 align:middle line:84%
So each human has to make a
choice with which frequency

00:37:07.333 --> 00:37:09.750 align:middle line:84%
they're going to align with,
meaning you're going to align

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.720 align:middle line:84%
with fear, paranoia,
or you're going

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:84%
to align with love, and
unity consciousness,

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.400 align:middle line:90%
and beautiful things.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.882 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What creates pure evil?

00:37:19.882 --> 00:37:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Oh, I think
source created pure evil,

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.910 align:middle line:84%
but I think evil
is misunderstood.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So evil is an energy that helps,
like I said earlier, separate.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And we need that separation
in order to experience love,

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:90%
like you and me relating.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.280 align:middle line:84%
We need this energy
that separates

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.150 align:middle line:84%
us, that disconnects us so
that we can come back together.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
it's just part of how

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:47.130 align:middle line:90%
our universe is organized.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:51.870 align:middle line:84%
But the evil, in a sense, has
turned from just separation

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:56.790 align:middle line:84%
into fear and into this
other polarity that's yuck.

00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:00.210 align:middle line:84%
But humans have a unique
ability to insulate ourselves

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.540 align:middle line:90%
from that polarity.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But we have to become aware of
when we're playing that game.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has evil tried to
influence you and stop you,

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:84%
because of the
goodness that you do?

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yes.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And I will say I'm
nothing special.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Because those dark energies
try and stop us all.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
They punk us all into
not living our best life.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:25.980 align:middle line:10%
They keep us in maybe jobs that
we know are making us suffer.

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.740 align:middle line:84%
They keep us, in a sense,
of not dreaming bigger,

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.560 align:middle line:84%
because we'll never
be able to do it.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.490 align:middle line:90%
So absolutely yes.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:36.300 align:middle line:84%
One of the funniest ways that
they do it in my business

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.913 align:middle line:84%
is by infiltrating my
assistance in a way.

00:38:39.913 --> 00:38:42.330 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, they'll start
making a bunch of mistakes.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.480 align:middle line:90%
And, oh--

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: --it's so annoying.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.610 align:middle line:90%
And I feel the energy of it.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:47.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like, ooh, it's going on.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're trying
get to you that way.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.772 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: They're trying
to get me to quit.

00:38:50.772 --> 00:38:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So it takes me a while
to clue in, right?

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So then I just do a
healing on my business,

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and in my software, and my
computers, and their computers.

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And then just like magic,
everything is fine after that.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you read
Genesis in the Bible

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and take out the
phrases of angels,

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.880 align:middle line:84%
because they're
all over the place,

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and replace it with
extraterrestrials,

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:16.860 align:middle line:84%
you could also make
the theory that angels

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.820 align:middle line:84%
are really ETs from other
worlds, other planets.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.476 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:39:22.476 --> 00:39:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I
wholeheartedly agree.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't mean
there aren't angels,

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.315 align:middle line:84%
but the Bible could make
reference to extraterrestrials.

00:39:29.315 --> 00:39:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Absolutely.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe that when you look at
it objectively, it really does.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.793 align:middle line:84%
If you take all the big
meaning away from it and go,

00:39:37.793 --> 00:39:39.210 align:middle line:84%
hey, here's something
coming down,

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.730 align:middle line:84%
a big chariot of fire
coming down from the sky,

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.590 align:middle line:90%
it gets pretty obvious.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.650 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not here to decide
for anybody what angels are,

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.940 align:middle line:10%
what aliens are.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But all I know is that there
are beings that are beyond

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.170 align:middle line:84%
physical, beyond the
Earth sphere that

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:56.910 align:middle line:84%
have come through
certain periods of time

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.020 align:middle line:90%
to come and visit.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.790 align:middle line:90%
And so, yes, there are angels.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And I also believe
that sometimes there

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:90%
could be some crossover.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
avoid the dark side?

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.010 align:middle line:90%


00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.860 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: I don't know if
it's about avoiding it.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're
always combated by it

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:90%
and hit with it every day.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Bombarded by it
is a better word.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, so
we are hit by it.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually not
that hard to become

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.270 align:middle line:90%
resilient and insulated to it.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:84%
The best way that
I know how to do

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:33.360 align:middle line:84%
that is to acknowledge your own
spiritual nature and your own--

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.380 align:middle line:84%
the force of love that
is bigger than you.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.963 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of
people have resistance

00:40:36.963 --> 00:40:38.100 align:middle line:90%
to using words like God.

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
acknowledge that there's

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:84%
this potent force of love that's
there to support you and align

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:84%
with you, then that
helps increase and boost

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.480 align:middle line:84%
your personal power and
your personal radiance.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
shining like a light,

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:55.240 align:middle line:84%
you just naturally become
a little more resilient.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.470 align:middle line:10%
But nobody-- I don't
believe anybody

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:02.198 align:middle line:10%
is fully resilient to it.

00:41:02.198 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody
comes to you and wants

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:09.580 align:middle line:84%
help to reach their angelic
realm, how do you start?

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.530 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, so if they're
coming to me in sessions--

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have no idea
who these people are.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But they say, I want
to reach my angel.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:18.940 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Oh, yeah.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually way, way
easier than most people think.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just hand
them the book and say,

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:24.570 align:middle line:90%
you have 21 days--

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: [INAUDIBLE] the book.

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to work on it?

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Here's my book.

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:26.610 align:middle line:90%
Read it.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Read the book.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Yeah,
so that's one way.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.812 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I do have a lot
of courses and programs

00:41:30.812 --> 00:41:33.870 align:middle line:84%
that put people into direct
contact with the angelic realm.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.450 align:middle line:84%
But if they were coming
to me one on one,

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I essentially work
with their energy body.

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.620 align:middle line:84%
The number one thing
that everybody has to do

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:44.320 align:middle line:84%
is detox their energy field,
which I didn't know about,

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.660 align:middle line:90%
I didn't necessarily believe in.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:84%
But we are carrying all this
crust around us from our life

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and possibly
lifetimes that really

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:53.280 align:middle line:84%
block us from the truth
and reality of spirit.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
always just detoxing

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.130 align:middle line:84%
from just the invisible
crest you're carrying around.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Because that automatically
brings incredible peace

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.400 align:middle line:90%
and connection to people.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one of the
first, most amazing testimonials

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:08.700 align:middle line:90%
that I got.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.370 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning when
I started inviting--

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:14.230 align:middle line:84%
when I started doing angel
work in my therapy practice,

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:90%
that was weird.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.120 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I started doing angel
work in my therapy practice.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:23.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the best testimonials
that I had was she called me.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said thank you
for introducing me to God.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.100 align:middle line:90%
And she was an atheist--

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:27.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:42:27.975 --> 00:42:30.670 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: --said she had such
a deep and powerful experience.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.253 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why she did-- it
was because I just detoxed her

00:42:33.253 --> 00:42:36.120 align:middle line:10%
for the first time in 35 years.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:40.042 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do angels want
to live like we do?

00:42:40.042 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: I don't know
if anybody would sign up

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.410 align:middle line:90%
for what we signed up for.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:45.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, come on.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: You would
if you were an angel?

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Oh, gosh.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, the polarity here
is really intense.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And the frequency of
separation is very--

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to describe.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.540 align:middle line:10%
But I don't know
if angels would--

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.200 align:middle line:10%
angels do want to
come and support us

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.440 align:middle line:10%
and do project their
energy into human form

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.350 align:middle line:10%
to intercede every
once in a while.

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But I have not
experienced human envy.

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure about hu--.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'll have to check in
with the angels about that.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you want to detox
spiritually, how do you start?

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.850 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: Yeah,
so the first step

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:28.250 align:middle line:10%
is acknowledging that you
have not just a physical body,

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.920 align:middle line:10%
but an energy body.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.143 align:middle line:84%
And this energy body is
like a car that is there.

00:43:34.143 --> 00:43:35.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like a vehicle for you.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it your astral body?

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: It's an astral body.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.270 align:middle line:84%
It's all of the elements of
the astral body, the soul

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:43.760 align:middle line:84%
body, and all the bodies
that people talk about,

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and the energy bodies
like the mental body,

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.657 align:middle line:84%
the emotional bodies,
all of that stuff.

00:43:47.657 --> 00:43:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But most of us don't
acknowledge that.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Because of our excessive
rational thinking,

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.010 align:middle line:84%
we only believe what
our eyes show us.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So because we don't
acknowledge the energy body,

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.810 align:middle line:90%
we don't service it.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And we know about we're going to
go jogging, and health, and all

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:03.110 align:middle line:90%
of that stuff.

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:05.590 align:middle line:10%
But we don't do
nearly enough support

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:10%
for our energetic health.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.472 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't service a
car engine for 35 years,

00:44:10.472 --> 00:44:11.680 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen to it?

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.030 align:middle line:90%
It's going to seize up.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And when your
energy body seizes,

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:19.413 align:middle line:84%
that's when your physical health
starts going down the tubes,

00:44:19.413 --> 00:44:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and all the other stuff
starts going down the tubes.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
just acknowledging

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.315 align:middle line:90%
that you have an energy body.

00:44:25.315 --> 00:44:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And you know who's really great
at helping you detox the energy

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.330 align:middle line:90%
body is Archangel Michael.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So you could call an Archangel
Michael and just say, hey,

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:34.310 align:middle line:84%
can you clear the crust, clear
the anger, clear the fear?

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's the
warrior, isn't he?

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, Yeah.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But our crust is usually
fear-based energy.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:44.680 align:middle line:10%
So he can detox you, even if
you have entities with you.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.047 align:middle line:84%
If you have demons,
entities, darkness,

00:44:47.047 --> 00:44:48.880 align:middle line:84%
you don't even have to
know that it's there.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Just assume you got
something in your space.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can just ask him to suck
away energy from your organs

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.715 align:middle line:90%
and from your energy body.

00:44:58.715 --> 00:45:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And if there's any
entities hanging out

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.600 align:middle line:84%
in your space that
don't belong there,

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.420 align:middle line:84%
you can ask him to take
those away as well.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wanted to wrap up
with another story of a guy who

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.410 align:middle line:84%
said he was swimming
in the ocean.

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And his friends are on the
beach side just waving at him.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And he's going out farther,
and farther, and farther.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And a current is taking him out.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:19.540 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, he
realizes, I can't get back.

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.770 align:middle line:90%
And he falls down.

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And he's plunging.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:22.570 align:middle line:90%
He's sinking.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:23.962 align:middle line:90%
He's under water.

00:45:23.962 --> 00:45:24.920 align:middle line:90%
And he said this is it.

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.690 align:middle line:90%
This is how I'm going to die.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:84%
He said at that
moment, a hand reaches

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.340 align:middle line:90%
through the top of the water.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.650 align:middle line:90%
He sees a hand.

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:33.490 align:middle line:90%
He reaches up.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And it grabs him
and pulls him up.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And he's gasping for
air, but he's alive.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:39.760 align:middle line:90%
He's out.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And he's starting to swim back,
but he realizes, oh, my God.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.590 align:middle line:90%
I got to thank that person.

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:48.140 align:middle line:84%
He turns and there's
nobody there.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.150 align:middle line:90%
How do these angels do this?

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:53.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's so mysterious.

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:55.940 align:middle line:10%
And I've heard so many
different stories of just

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.820 align:middle line:10%
divine intervention like that.

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:02.240 align:middle line:10%
My sense is it takes a
lot of energy to do that.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And it really happens,
from what I understand,

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.730 align:middle line:84%
when it's not
someone's time to go.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And really, the only way
to sometimes pull out

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.730 align:middle line:84%
a physical body is through
manifesting in a physical way.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I guess it changes
their life forever, doesn't it?

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the whole point.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who
wouldn't after that?

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:22.430 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty intense when you
have an experience like that.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:23.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a game changer.

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:24.860 align:middle line:90%
It changes everything.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Corin, thanks
for being on the program.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRILLO: Oh, thanks
for having me, George.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's very special.

00:46:29.265 --> 00:46:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: Yeah, so nice--

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very special.

00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:31.168 align:middle line:90%
>>GRILLO: --to be here.

00:46:31.168 --> 00:46:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we knew
that in this episode,

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.530 align:middle line:84%
we explored how to
start communicating

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:39.150 align:middle line:84%
with angels and the different
signs that they might send us.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.980 align:middle line:10%
And if you feel the desire
to become angel empowered,

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:46.480 align:middle line:10%
check out Corin's book,
"The Angel Experiment."

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.800 align:middle line:10%
And what's your website?

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.370 align:middle line:10%
>>GRILLO: www.coringrillo.com.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:52.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You got it.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
