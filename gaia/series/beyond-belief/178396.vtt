00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to this edition

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:10%
George Noory with you.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:10%
We've got the real Fox Mulder
from the "X-Files" with us.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:90%
His name is John DeSouza.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
John is a former
FBI agent who has

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:84%
gotten involved in some of
the strangest paranormal

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.029 align:middle line:84%
investigations you
will ever imagine.

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be talking
about that on the program

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
John, it's always
good to see you.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN DESOUZA:
Thank you, George.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.451 align:middle line:84%
It's great to be
here with you today.

00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:52.957 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you were
one heck of an FBI agent.

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Well, I don't
know about that but, yes,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:10%
I was involved in a lot
of high-level cases--

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:10%
terrorism cases and
paranormal cases as well.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got
you involved in that?

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.004 align:middle line:90%
Why did you become an FBI agent?

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:07.670 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: I became
an FBI agent because

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:10%
of my paranormal experiences
before I even joined the FBI.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:10%
When I was a kid, I had several
experiences of contact--

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:10%
observation experiences
with UFOs and other things

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:10%
of that nature.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And that awoke in me a
desire to really go further

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.460 align:middle line:84%
into becoming a professional
investigator to find out

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:90%
about these things.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
think as an FBI agent

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.641 align:middle line:84%
you were going to be able to
uncover these kinds of stories?

00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I really did.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And I once I got
there, I found out

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
lot of work being

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
done on paranormal
themes, on UFOs,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.770 align:middle line:84%
on many areas of the
paranormal, supernatural

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about today.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you stumble
across the real X-Files?

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I feel like I did.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of those
cases are actually

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:10%
available for people to look at
today at vault.fbi.gov, where

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:10%
there's a giant tab that
says Unexplained Phenomenon.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And people can go look at the
cases that over the last 60,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:84%
70 years have been declassified
and are available for anyone

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:90%
to look at.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, it's interesting.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
My career took the
same kind of path

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
as yours, where when
I was a young kid.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to investigate
all these weird stories

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:90%
and paranormal mysteries.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And I figured the best way to
do that was to be not an FBI

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%
agent, but a broadcaster.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:90%
So I went in this field as well.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're no
longer an FBI agent,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:84%
but you're still
investigating the paranormal.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't you give that up?

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Because when
I left the FBI in 2013,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I wanted to keep
investigating areas that needed

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.090 align:middle line:84%
investigation-- because
they had so much deception

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:90%
and cover in them.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around at politics,
economics, other areas.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But the paranormal
apparently has so much

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
deception and cover that
is involved with this area,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:84%
that I just thought
this is where they need

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.070 align:middle line:84%
an investigator to
penetrate these truths,

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:84%
to pierce this veil
and to get to what's

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:90%
really going on underneath.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Because it's used.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It's used against us
to make us believe

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're actually living
in a world that isn't real.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
The real stuff is
just beyond this veil

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:84%
that has been put
over us, so that we

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
don't see the truth of
what's really going on.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did your
colleagues in the FBI

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:84%
think of these
interests that you had?

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well,
a lot of them were

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:90%
the source of ridicule for me.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I thought.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.496 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah,
some of them did.

00:03:38.496 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
But like I always say, I
was ridiculed in public.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
But I was consulted in private,
because a lot of FBI agents

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and other people
throughout law enforcement

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:90%
always had their own issues--

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
paranormal issues and cases,
even that they were interested

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
in, that they wanted to
know the truth about.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it one of
the reasons you got out

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.210 align:middle line:90%
of the FBI--

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:90%
was the ridicule too much?

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: No, not at all.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I had done 25 years
as an FBI agent--

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.662 align:middle line:84%
special agent working
all these cases

00:04:07.662 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:90%
and working all these things.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And I had done as much as
I could within that system.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.519 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is an incredible
controversy-- surrounded

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:90%
a little 6-inch mummy.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:90%
We call it the Atacama mummy.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Steven Greer, of course, has
been spearheading the drive

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:84%
to get the world to realize
this thing's the real deal.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:10%
>>STEVEN GREER: This came to
us in the last couple of years.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:10%
And there is a man who runs an
institute in another country

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.935 align:middle line:10%
that I cannot talk about.

00:04:39.935 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:10%
But he came into possession
of a little creature.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:10%
It is humanoid.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.170 align:middle line:10%
It does not look human.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:10%
>> We have acquired an EBE,
an extraterrestrial biological

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:10%
entity.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.200 align:middle line:10%
We're flying over to Europe
soon to take a tissue sample

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:10%
and do some DNA testing.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:10%
>>GREER: This was found
in the Atacama Desert.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:10%
We don't know how it came about.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:10%
Here's a great view of the face
and cheek bone-- very complex.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, there is a fracture here.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:10%
And behind this right
ear is caved in.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:10%
And that's how this
ET being was killed.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:10%
>> We have the best scientists
in the US from Stanford that

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:10%
are going to be doing
the testing itself,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.410 align:middle line:10%
to see what this really is and
also to rule out what it's not.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, what do we know
about this little 6-inch thing?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: There's a lot
of things we know, George.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:84%
This thing-- I would never say
that this is an alien creature.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But what I am
saying about this is

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that you have to go
from the presumption

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:90%
that it's not human.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.562 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That's what
we have to look at here.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could be
a baby of some--

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Of some
sort of thing.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Of some sort.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually,
it can't really--

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:90%
it cannot be a fetus.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.842 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the preliminary
findings that were done--

00:06:01.842 --> 00:06:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's so small.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: --by Stanford.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
explain that if you're

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
trying to stay within the
paradigm of mainstream reality?

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.230 align:middle line:84%
You have to say, well,
it could be a fetus.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the only way.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:84%
But, no, this thing is
apparently a different species.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And the preliminary findings
at Stanford University

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:90%
found that to be the case.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.810 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, they're
in this documentary series

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that we have here at
Gaia, and it's on record.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Garry P. Nolan, the director of
Stanford University Department

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:90%
of Genetics.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.340 align:middle line:84%
He is on record in
that documentary

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:84%
that we just saw, saying
all the preliminary findings

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that the preliminary
genetic testing found.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were that this thing
appears to not be human,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:90%
yet it is humanoid.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.057 align:middle line:84%
Humanoid just means
two arms, two legs.

00:06:57.057 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he kind of
attract, though, after the fact?

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.223 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Well, no.

00:07:00.223 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Because he actually did all of
the genetic testing honestly.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Everything was done correctly.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Everything was consistent.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All above board.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.218 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Above board.

00:07:09.218 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:84%
But this thing has about a
dozen extreme anomalies that

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:90%
differentiate it from human.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:84%
The cranium is three times
the size of a human cranium.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The eye sockets
are the eye sockets

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.740 align:middle line:84%
that are the wrap around,
sort of the thing--

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like those alien Grays.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, that we
associate with alien Grays.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'm not saying
this thing is an alien.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying
presumptively, oh, you just

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:90%
have to look at it.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:90%
It does not appear to be human.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, this planet has
had mythology forever about

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:90%
little people--

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:90%
leprechauns, fairies.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Might this creature
fit that category?

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: It could.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:84%
In South America where a
lot of my family is from,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.280 align:middle line:90%
we had what we call the duendes.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:10%
That is a word that means
little people, little creatures.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:10%
And they could be anywhere
from 6 inches to a foot tall.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:10%
And they would appear
sometimes at night

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:10%
whenever there was a moon out.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And they would scurry
around, and you'd see them.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that's
common in the Spanish-speaking

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:90%
countries.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And other places have the
myths of the little people.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Indigenous
to this planet, right?

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So not from some
other planetary system.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:90%
They're earthbound.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why I believe the Atacama
Desert alien mummy is not

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:90%
an issue of alien visitors.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.480 align:middle line:10%
It is an issue of
something else that

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:10%
could be living on the earth.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.935 align:middle line:10%
It could belong to the
earth even more than we do.

00:08:47.935 --> 00:08:49.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're looking
at here, especially

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:90%
since from the Atacama Desert.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
We actually have reports
from the ground--

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
testimony, police reports that
these things have been spotted,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.146 align:middle line:90%
seen, recorded.

00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To this day?

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: To this day
are very much alive

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and kicking, above
the ground at night,

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
sometimes whenever there's a
moon out in the Atacama Desert.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, this
skeleton is about how old?

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: The preliminary
tests all showed,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:10%
and they're on record.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:10%
Stanford University is on record
saying that it is obviously

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:10%
not a fetus.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.545 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
look at the bones--

00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and we have several pictures
of the radiology that was done.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
thickness of the bones.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:90%
The skull is fused.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.020 align:middle line:10%
The joints are fused.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:10%
This thing was alive for
at least eight years.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But they're very, very
old in terms of carbon dating.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
It has been around
for a long, long time.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What drives
Dr. Steven Greer?

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
He's been into this
field for a long time.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I will remember that he tried
to get the Disclosure Project

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:90%
underway in 2001--

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:90%
happened during 9/11.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So that got pushed
to the wayside.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.330 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't given up yet.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:84%
He's a former emergency
medical doctor

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
who has left his
practice to concentrate

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
full time on investigating
extraterrestrials and this.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:90%
What drives him, John?

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: What drives him is
the same thing that drives me,

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:84%
which is that he is
a true investigator

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.600 align:middle line:84%
person who is trying to get
to the truth on these issues.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And in this case with
the Atacama mummy,

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
the small mistake
that he made was

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.986 align:middle line:84%
after he had done all the
preliminary investigation, even

00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:84%
the preliminary
testing, because he has

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:90%
the genetics on this creature--

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.440 align:middle line:84%
the small mistake that he makes
is because he's a scientist,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:84%
he trusted mainstream
authorities,

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:90%
mainstream scientists.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
mistake that he made.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they did all the
preliminary testing--

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.670 align:middle line:90%
is correct.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They did all the main
testing, genetic testing

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.450 align:middle line:90%
that took years.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.427 align:middle line:90%
They did that correctly, too.

00:10:57.427 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
But then at the end,
just a couple of months

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.010 align:middle line:84%
ago, they came up with what we
call in the law a whole cloth

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.047 align:middle line:90%
conclusion.

00:11:04.047 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
A conclusion that
came out of nowhere.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not based on any of the
science, any of the testing--

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:90%
based on nothing.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the conclusion
was contrary to whatever

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:11.440 align:middle line:90%
done before.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: To everything.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Everything that had
been done before.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:90%
The conclusion was it's human.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a human fetus, a
girl human fetus deformed.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
When that had been against
all the preliminary testing

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
that they'd done, against
the actual testing

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
that had been done during
a long period of time.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:84%
It was a whole cloth conclusion
they just threw in there.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And it had nothing
to do with science.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they admit
the creature was once

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:84%
something possibly alive,
or in the fetus's case

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.987 align:middle line:84%
it was alive, until it died in
the womb if that's the case.

00:11:45.987 --> 00:11:47.945 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, that's
what the conclusion is.

00:11:47.945 --> 00:11:48.745 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:48.745 --> 00:11:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
skeleton, it's obviously--

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and all you need is a high
school biology understanding.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would a cranial
skull be that enlarged

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.117 align:middle line:90%
in something that was--

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: So small.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So small.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, it wouldn't be.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was actually one
of the preliminary findings.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:90%
The preliminary findings.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And again, the final conclusion
cannot be radically different

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:84%
from the preliminary,
because there is a subset,

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:84%
unless your defective machinery
was used in the preliminary

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:90%
testing.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And in the preliminary
testing, Dr. Garry Nolan

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.080 align:middle line:90%
said that the thing was a male.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.240 align:middle line:84%
That it was definitely
not a fetus of any kind.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And that it had
been bearing weight

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:84%
for at least eight years,
because the thickness

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:90%
of the bones.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.751 align:middle line:84%
You can tell just from looking
at the thickness of the bones.

00:12:39.751 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, this conclusion
came out just a couple

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
of months ago-- was fed out
to all the mainstream media

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:50.110 align:middle line:84%
outlets and just said, oh,
it's just a human fetus--

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:90%
a female human fetus.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they admit
it was biological?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, yes.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.200 align:middle line:84%
You can see that
even on the X-rays

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.160 align:middle line:90%
that it was a biological entity.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:90%
It was integral.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.040 align:middle line:90%
It was whole.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that
was out and walking around

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.195 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:13:04.195 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your best
guess about this little mummy?

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen
pictures of it, John.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:90%
It's weird.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:90%
It's bizarre.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe it could be a
little deformed fetus as well.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:90%
But it's very strange.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It could be a
deformed fetus if according

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:90%
to science--

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.710 align:middle line:84%
if you had other examples
that you could bring forth

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh, here's a similar
mutation that was human.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Here's another example.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's what science is.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
It's showing results--
reproducible results

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.980 align:middle line:84%
that you can now
then compare and say,

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, this could be human, but
that's not what was done here.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:84%
What was done here was
a whole cloth conclusion

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:84%
that they just came up
with out of nowhere,

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.675 align:middle line:84%
based on no science that it
was a deformed human fetus.

00:13:52.675 --> 00:13:53.980 align:middle line:90%
That's not what science means.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:90%
That's not what science is.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:84%
This thing has to be presumed
to be a non-human species.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.350 align:middle line:90%
This is a huge scandal.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.122 align:middle line:84%
Because we have now seen
behind the curtain--

00:14:05.122 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:84%
what the man behind
the curtain has

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
been doing to keep us from
exposing new non-human species

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:90%
on the earth.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
they holding back?

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: The reason
they are holding back

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.620 align:middle line:90%
is because they have grants.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:90%
These scientists have grants.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
They have tenure at
Stanford University.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
They have endowments that amount
to maybe a billion dollars

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:90%
that come to the university.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.210 align:middle line:84%
They have labs that have
licensing requirements

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:90%
every year.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going to lose
all that just because Steven

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.624 align:middle line:84%
Greer or myself want to find
a new non-human species.

00:14:43.624 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
They're just not
going to do that.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:84%
You think we'll ever get
this answer to this creature?

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, we will when
true investigators and people

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
like Gaia TV and
Dr. Steven Greer--

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:90%
get your own laboratories.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.085 align:middle line:84%
You have to own the laboratories
to give the true results.

00:15:01.085 --> 00:15:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but
then you're skewed.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Because then people
accuse you of being

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
an insider, and that they would
prefer that an outside firm

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:90%
would do that.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.098 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: That's true.

00:15:14.098 --> 00:15:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But what if all
the outside firms

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
are under the same control
of the same elite powers

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
in control, that are
always going to give--

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Got to find an
independent one somehow.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, but no one
is independent in mainstream

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.557 align:middle line:84%
science from scientific
authorities and the people

00:15:29.557 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:90%
that they answer to.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In this
particular case,

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:37.200 align:middle line:84%
it's very possible that it
was an earthbound creature

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:90%
or an extraterrestrial.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.410 align:middle line:84%
You can't rule that
out either, can you?

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Right.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
But right now what
we're looking at

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:84%
is creatures that look like
they probably belong to earth.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.926 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we have to go from.

00:15:49.926 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
still exciting.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.108 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's still exciting.

00:15:53.108 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1996, a
space shuttle mission

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:90%
was conducting some experiments.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And they were using a long
tether that broke off.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that because that

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.580 align:middle line:90%
has a lot to do with this.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:10.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:10%
See, so what we're looking at--

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:10%
after the tether broke off is
like, what are these things?

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.220 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Suddenly,
dozens and then hundreds

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:10%
of these perfectly
formed disks just

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.670 align:middle line:10%
started appearing
from everywhere.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do we know
how big those dots are?

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: We can
only do by comparison,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:10%
that we know the tether
itself is 12 miles long.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 12 miles long?

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.237 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: So it's
sticking straight.

00:16:40.237 --> 00:16:41.570 align:middle line:90%
And there's one of those giant--

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.187 align:middle line:84%
that thing has to be at
least a mile across--

00:16:45.187 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:90%
the one you're seeing right now.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.311 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly,
there's something, right?

00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They exhibit
the same patterns.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:90%
This happened in 1996.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And this experiment--
there it is.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And look at the pulse
it's giving off.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:90%
That pulse is an energy scan.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.130 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's
scanning the area.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.047 align:middle line:84%
Because the pulse is not
coming from the back.

00:17:03.047 --> 00:17:04.171 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from the front.

00:17:04.171 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It looks biological.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: And yes, it does.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.187 align:middle line:84%
And I also believe these
UFOs are alive themselves.

00:17:09.187 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they conclude?

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.906 align:middle line:90%
What this flight-- about?

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Oh,
well, at the time,

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:84%
NASA was able to
just stammer out.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Look at their
perfectly shaped disc.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:84%
They all have the donut
hole and the little shark

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:90%
bite on the outside.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And I have a theory
about that shark bite--

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.160 align:middle line:84%
is simply a Plexiglas
window-like area

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
that allows people to
look inside and see

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:90%
whatever they want you to see.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think this
is biological or some kind

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:90%
of machinery?

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I myself believe
that true UFOs are actually

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:84%
biological, that they
are conscious beings.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:90%
That they are alive themselves.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looks like
a cell, doesn't it?

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:90%
A large cell.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And this thing at the time--
all they could stammer out

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.419 align:middle line:90%
was ice particles and debris.

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:55.960 align:middle line:84%
That's all that NASA
was able to say.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was weird.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.126 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And then they
took down the public server

00:17:59.126 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:90%
that this was on.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And NASA never again
used a public server

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
to expose their satellite
filming at the time,

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and so that this
wouldn't happen again.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When John Glenn
was the first American

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:84%
to orbit the planet,
he reported seeing

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
these twinkly little
objects everywhere

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.075 align:middle line:90%
around the spaceship.

00:18:22.075 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
They concluded
that it could have

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.050 align:middle line:84%
been debris from the spaceship,
or something that was cast out,

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was very similar
to what we just saw here.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Because it appears
that whenever you

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.890 align:middle line:84%
have things going on out
in outer space, especially

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.510 align:middle line:84%
this tether giving off both
electricity and magnetic energy

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:46.970 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, it seems like
it acted as a distress beacon.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Because these things
appeared from everywhere.

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about almost a
hundred or more of these things

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
that all showed up and
to investigate what

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:90%
was going with this tether.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.551 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the
same thing happened

00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:02.480 align:middle line:84%
with John Glenn in the incident
that you're talking about.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:84%
They're just trying to
find out what's going on.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Because NASA does not
control the outer atmosphere

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.650 align:middle line:84%
It is these things that
control the outer atmosphere.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And they want to know what's
going on whenever something out

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.160 align:middle line:84%
of the ordinary is
happening, like the tether

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:90%
or like John Glenn in the ISS.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, of
everything you've seen--

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
we've just illustrated
this was real,

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might have been.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:90%
What's your gut tell you?

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: My gut
tells me that this

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.520 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what a person's
common sense and their own five

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
senses tell them, that these are
supernatural, non-terrestrial

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:84%
vehicles that appeared to
find out what was going on.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They saw
the space shuttle.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:90%
They were curious.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:90%
They show up.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And they need to
find out what's happening.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these craft
could have been how big?

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.186 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Some
of them could have

00:19:53.186 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:84%
been-- look like they were a
mile or two across in diameter.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.114 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those what we just
witnessed were a mile long?

00:19:59.114 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes,
some of them were.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.029 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: They were all sizes.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But some of them were
tremendous in size.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't have
any basis to compare.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.185 align:middle line:84%
To me, they looked
like little tiny dots.

00:20:09.185 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: A lot of
them-- some of them were.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But since we're comparing
with a 12-mile long tether,

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.660 align:middle line:84%
we can see that some of them
were a mile or two across.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did NASA ever
investigate these publicly?

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: No, no,
they would not do that.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about privately?

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Perhaps.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.090 align:middle line:90%
No, I doubt it.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Because NASA-- these things--

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
they just want these
things to go away.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.476 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
talk about them.

00:20:32.476 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
address them, except

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.452 align:middle line:90%
to say ice particles and debris.

00:20:37.452 --> 00:20:38.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's all that they say.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.201 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
great, easy excuse.

00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, exactly.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Privately, what do you
think they're saying at NASA?

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:84%
What do you think they were
saying when they saw those?

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I think
they're privately--

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite certain that
what they said was let's

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:84%
change the server that
displays these things so

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that these things don't
get exposed again.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And so that people don't make
up stories about these things.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're saying.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Edgar Mitchell,
the Apollo 14 astronaut,

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.611 align:middle line:84%
had he still been alive
would have looked at that

00:21:07.611 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:90%
and went, UFOs.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah,
it's common sense.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
you really need when you're

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:90%
dealing with these things.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need
to be deferring

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.510 align:middle line:84%
to mainstream authorities
that are really

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.439 align:middle line:84%
not doing anything to expose
truth on these issues.

00:21:25.439 --> 00:21:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
look like these were

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:90%
under any intelligent control?

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Absolutely.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of these vehicles as you
see them going by the tether--

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
they actually slow down so that
they can better scan what's

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.740 align:middle line:90%
happening with the tether.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:90%
And then they speed up again.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.606 align:middle line:84%
So they are being
intelligently controlled.

00:21:42.606 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we know
what the astronauts

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.534 align:middle line:90%
were saying about this?

00:21:45.534 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I believe
that the astronauts

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:84%
were saying that this
looks like an unknown UFO.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:90%
All of these things.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, where
are they coming from?

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Are they up there all the time?

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Are they cloaked?

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Are they interdimensionally
appearing

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:84%
from another dimension coming
into our physical space?

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:11.184 align:middle line:84%
And if so, does that mean that
they're up there all the time?

00:22:11.184 --> 00:22:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have we heard
any transmissions

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.995 align:middle line:84%
from the shuttle astronauts
at the time about this?

00:22:15.995 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I don't
believe that we did.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:84%
However, I always-- all
the cases that I bring out

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.090 align:middle line:84%
are cases that I know were
the subject of chatter

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:84%
between the intelligence
agencies, even

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.286 align:middle line:84%
of different friendly
countries to the United States.

00:22:30.286 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I worked in the
national security structure

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
during all that time,
I was privy to chatter.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And the nature of
the chatter was, what

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:90%
are we going to do about this?

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to keep
this from getting out

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.360 align:middle line:90%
among the public?

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.227 align:middle line:84%
That's the sort
of thing I heard.

00:22:48.227 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
something that people

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:84%
should be scared about
or enlightened about?

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I think some
people may be scared,

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:90%
but they shouldn't be.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:90%
This is something that--

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.740 align:middle line:84%
anything that brings out
truth is always a good thing.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to know
about these things,

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and we need to know about
the alien visitors that

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.600 align:middle line:84%
are beneficial towards us,
that are friendly towards us.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And these, for
instance-- and you

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:84%
have to judge that
by their deeds.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And these particular
UFOs that we

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.710 align:middle line:84%
see here are-- all
they're trying to do

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.087 align:middle line:90%
is find out information.

00:23:25.087 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:90%
That's all they're trying to do.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to find
out what's happening.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't appear to
have any malevolent purpose

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:90%
or anything negative towards us.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you
categorize this case

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.490 align:middle line:84%
with things that
you've looked at?

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I would
categorize this as one

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:84%
of the top cases of genuine,
supernatural incident that

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.827 align:middle line:84%
occurred that has been
successfully buried

00:23:50.827 --> 00:23:51.910 align:middle line:90%
by mainstream authorities.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I never
heard of this before.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:90%
How did you come upon it?

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, this is a case
that, again, when it happened,

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:84%
it was the subject of chatter
between the intelligence

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:06.310 align:middle line:84%
agencies of different countries
where they were saying,

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:84%
we need to do
something about this.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.117 align:middle line:84%
We need to make sure that
this doesn't get out.

00:24:10.117 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I heard about it.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the astronauts
at the time, John,

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:84%
feel that they were
jeopardized, or their safety

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.170 align:middle line:84%
was compromised, or anything
like that with this sighting?

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I think what
the astronauts would say--

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.322 align:middle line:84%
well, most of them would
be of the nature of,

00:24:30.322 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:84%
here's another
thing that we're not

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.071 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to talk about.

00:24:33.071 --> 00:24:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Here's another
thing that we have

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
to keep quiet that we're not
supposed to say anything about.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Because anything that they
would say would be common sense.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.490 align:middle line:84%
It would be common
sense reality.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.645 align:middle line:84%
And so that is very
frowned upon at NASA.

00:24:46.645 --> 00:24:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what boggles my
mind is the fact that the size

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:90%
of these objects--

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:84%
again, very difficult
to ascertain when

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:84%
you're just looking
at the video.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.230 align:middle line:84%
But when you tell me they
could be a mile long each,

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.089 align:middle line:90%
that's dramatic as all get up.

00:25:01.089 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, it appears
that some of these things--

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's not
an nice particle.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:06.748 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, that's what
we categorize in ufology

00:25:06.748 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:84%
as mother ships, the ones
that are a mile or two across

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:90%
in diameter.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And so there were several
of these mother ships

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
that appeared during
this incident.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:84%
But there were also many tiny
ships, tiny disks that also--

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what is
a tiny disk to you?

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.435 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, to me that's
like 100 feet in diameter.

00:25:26.435 --> 00:25:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's tiny?

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing story.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
amazing cases out there.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And we will talk about a few
more of them with you here.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But in this particular case,
what do you think the shuttle

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:84%
astronauts said
when they came back?

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.587 align:middle line:90%
Do you think this bothered them?

00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Well, I
mean, unless you're

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:84%
talking about like a
renegade like Edgar Mitchell

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:84%
or someone like
that, they're all

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:84%
going to say ice
particles and debris.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm thinking.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:58.583 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And back off the truth.

00:25:58.583 --> 00:26:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we
ever get the truth?

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I think
we're getting it now.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.170 align:middle line:84%
We just have to have the
courage to look at it,

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and keep our common
sense, and believe

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:84%
what our eyes are telling us,
and say, I know what I saw.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's an amazing
story that as you said,

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.630 align:middle line:84%
was kind of brushed
under the table.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And unless we continue to
talk about things like this,

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:84%
nobody is ever going
to know about it.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we need to keep
pushing these things forward,

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:84%
so that real disclosure
can be continued.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
continue to investigate

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.740 align:middle line:90%
these kinds of older cases?

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.424 align:middle line:84%
Is there information out there
that you can still dig up?

00:26:40.424 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Absolutely.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:84%
There's always new information
about things that are true,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:90%
things that are real.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:49.261 align:middle line:84%
There's always new things
to be found out about those.

00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As an
investigator, how would you

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:90%
start checking into that again?

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: The only way is
to go to eyewitness testimony

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:90%
of people who were there--

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The astronauts?

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.721 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: --at the time.

00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, absolutely-- to
talk to the astronauts,

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to investigate, to interview,
and maybe even interrogate

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
the people who were
on the ground who

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.730 align:middle line:84%
were around at that time, like
some of the analysts as well.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.354 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It must have been
a golly gee moment for them.

00:27:15.354 --> 00:27:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Absolutely.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:84%
It was a golly gee moment,
because it's really a giant--

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.720 align:middle line:84%
it's actually a giant
headache for them.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Because they're just
looking at it and thinking,

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.960 align:middle line:84%
oh, here's another thing
we have to cover up.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: 2008-- there was a
sighting in Turkey of a UFO.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
But witnesses saw something
else beyond just the UFO, John.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:41.440 align:middle line:84%
I want you to comment on
this video as we look at it.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.807 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: This is in
Turkey off the shore.

00:27:44.807 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What is it?

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.598 align:middle line:10%
What are we looking at?

00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:49.510 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: This is a
UFO that was filmed

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:10%
with a high-speed camera.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:56.710 align:middle line:10%
And it was-- and speaking of the
little shark bite that we saw

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:59.104 align:middle line:10%
on the other vehicles--

00:27:59.104 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Whoa, look at that.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.010 align:middle line:10%


00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.720 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: --this
particular video

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:11.470 align:middle line:10%
shows a UFO that has that
little Plexiglas section.

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:13.180 align:middle line:10%
It's called the Turkey
UFO, but it's also

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.245 align:middle line:10%
called the observed occupants,
the visible occupants UFO.

00:28:17.245 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean, clearly
that's not a plane, clearly.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:10%
And the film has
been authenticated

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:10%
by the scientific boards
of the country of Turkey.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.250 align:middle line:10%
And it is the first
incident where

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:10%
we have been able to look in
through that Plexiglas section

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:10%
and see inside these--

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.967 align:middle line:10%
it looks like two
gray creatures.

00:28:40.967 --> 00:28:41.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.650 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: In through
the Plexiglas section.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Inside that object?

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, it'll come
up here in just a second.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:10%
And you'll be able to see
through that Plexiglas shark

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.550 align:middle line:10%
bite on the outer
disc of this thing

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:10%
to see what was inside of this.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:10%
That's why this UFO
is known as the--

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.440 align:middle line:10%
it's known as the
Turkey UFO in 2008

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.555 align:middle line:10%
and also known as the
visible occupants UFO.

00:29:09.555 --> 00:29:11.925 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, is that the moon?

00:29:11.925 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: We're
coming up on it.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:10%
Now, you'll see the section
here in the UFO, George, where

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.364 align:middle line:10%
you can actually see inside.

00:29:19.364 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:10%
That's the shark bite.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.220 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, I
see what you mean.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.470 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: That's the shark
bite that I'm talking about.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.178 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
call it a shark bite?

00:29:25.178 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, because it's
just a name for that little gap,

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:34.150 align:middle line:84%
that see-through gap in the
discs that is seen during--

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.920 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would understand
whatever that means.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Oh,
here's the close up

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.757 align:middle line:90%
stills of the visible objects.

00:29:44.757 --> 00:29:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those are heads--

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.720 align:middle line:84%
those little-- in
fact, two ET heads.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, the
visible occupants

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:10%
through that little shark bite
on the outside of the disc.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.565 align:middle line:10%
And that's where they are.

00:29:56.565 --> 00:29:59.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's the two of them.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Again, this
was 2008, right?

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:01.780 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.660 align:middle line:10%
However, it happened
three times--

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:08.119 align:middle line:10%
in 2007, 2008, and 2009.

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The same object?

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: The same
object on the same beach

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.480 align:middle line:84%
observed with the same
high-speed camera.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.384 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who videotaped
it or taped it?

00:30:15.384 --> 00:30:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It was a couple of
security guards on the beach

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.620 align:middle line:84%
who were experimenting with
this high-speed camera--

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.420 align:middle line:90%
distance camera.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they see the
occupants at the time?

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Not at the time.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
couldn't blow it up?

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.910 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Right.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.950 align:middle line:10%
And then they saw the occupants.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:34.030 align:middle line:10%
And the country of
Turkey is different.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:10%
Apparently, they
didn't get the memo

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.750 align:middle line:10%
from the elite powers in control
that every other country got,

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.230 align:middle line:10%
that says you have to cover
up anything to do with UFOs.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell anybody
about anything, right?

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.494 align:middle line:84%
Well, Turkey didn't
get the memo.

00:30:46.494 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Because all their scientific
boards authenticated this film

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.280 align:middle line:90%
as being genuine and real.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And the newspapers wrote
that these were actual UFOs.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.820 align:middle line:84%
They all reported this as being
real, true, alien visitors

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.270 align:middle line:90%
in a real, non-terrestrial UFO.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, clearly,
John, that wasn't a plane.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- and I've seen
a lot of plane videos.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Those weren't planes.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they were,
but they were surely different

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.040 align:middle line:90%
than anything I've ever seen.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Right.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Plus, they had-- to see
the entire video, which

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:84%
is available on my YouTube
channel and other places.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:90%
You see the entire video.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:84%
The thing does have
maneuvers that is not--

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.010 align:middle line:90%
it's not terrestrial.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not human technology.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.020 align:middle line:84%
The thing-- it
suddenly disappears out

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:84%
into the atmosphere
in a millisecond.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.939 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it just goes.

00:31:42.939 --> 00:31:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it was gone?

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Completely gone.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So we just don't have
the capacity to do that.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
physical things that tells us

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:90%
it's a non-terrestrial.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
you rate this UFO case

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.320 align:middle line:84%
with some of the others
that we've talked about?

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I would
rate it at 10.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:31:58.900 --> 00:31:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:31:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's high.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Because it
shows something innovative.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.700 align:middle line:90%
It shows the visible occupants.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's known as the
visible occupants UFO as well.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that's
never been seen before

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and has been authenticated
by the actual government

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.055 align:middle line:90%
of Turkey.

00:32:15.055 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:90%
And to this day, Turkey--

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, the government
of Turkey considers UFOs--

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.420 align:middle line:84%
alien visitors real,
true, authentic topic.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it because
of cases like this?

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, I think this
case was the beginning of that.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, they didn't
bow to pressure from outside.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
put this forward

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:84%
as being what it is, a real
UFO and real alien visitors.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it
were hoaxed, let's

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:51.340 align:middle line:84%
say by another country that
wanted to confuse other people,

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:90%
could they do that?

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Sure, they could try.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But that's why
this was subjected

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:02.200 align:middle line:84%
to forensic examination by
very, very capable scientists

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.640 align:middle line:84%
in Turkey and was also
examined by the great Dr. Roger

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.159 align:middle line:90%
Leir who passed away.

00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, he
was one of the best.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And he actually examined
this very carefully

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and brought this
film to this country

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and publicized it
first in this country.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is the case
that he was convinced

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:20.844 align:middle line:90%
was legitimately real.

00:33:20.844 --> 00:33:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Absolutely.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And he did the examinations
to prove it, also.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's why this case
is one of the top cases

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:31.600 align:middle line:84%
that we need to bring forward
now under this new paradigm,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.940 align:middle line:84%
to show the example of
things that were genuine,

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.620 align:middle line:84%
authentic, and were buried
by mainstream authorities.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These ETs or whatever
they may be in the craft--

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:42.730 align:middle line:90%
do you think they're robotics?

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I don't
know what they are.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, I'm not certain
if they're even alien visitors,

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.740 align:middle line:90%
but they are something.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, they could be
anything going from robotics

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.660 align:middle line:90%
to a hologram.

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:01.330 align:middle line:84%
What I do know is that
whatever made that craft wanted

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.340 align:middle line:90%
us to see what was inside.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They weren't
hiding this time, were they?

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.690 align:middle line:84%
They wanted us to look through
that Plexiglas section.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm saying Plexiglas.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:09.730 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything--

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not Plexiglas.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: --transparent.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Something transparent,
that little shark bite.

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Because why would you
have that in a vehicle?

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:18.429 align:middle line:90%
Why do you need it?

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:84%
They're not driving
the thing like we drive

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:21.982 align:middle line:90%
to look where you're going.

00:34:21.982 --> 00:34:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, why
do you need that?

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.000 align:middle line:84%
It's because they
want us to see.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did
I see what I saw?

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:28.421 align:middle line:90%
Two heads, basically?

00:34:28.421 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, exactly.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You saw that, too?

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And there is more film
that actually shows

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.679 align:middle line:90%
one of them moving slightly--

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.929 align:middle line:90%
moving from side to side.

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 2008?

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.901 align:middle line:90%
Poof, it was gone?

00:34:39.901 --> 00:34:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Anything ever repeat?

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.449 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, it repeated.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:46.659 align:middle line:84%
This actually happened
first time in 2007,

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:50.139 align:middle line:84%
then again in 2008,
then again in 2009.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.159 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same craft?

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Same exact craft.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.524 align:middle line:90%
Same two occupants, apparently.

00:34:55.524 --> 00:34:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must
be having a field day

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.080 align:middle line:90%
visiting good old Mother Earth.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:90%
And they're here for a reason.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they
want to be seen.

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.342 align:middle line:84%
And they want to be
observed for some reason.

00:35:06.342 --> 00:35:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they did
not want to be seen,

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:09.554 align:middle line:90%
they could hide, couldn't they?

00:35:09.554 --> 00:35:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Absolutely.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So the only reason they have
that see-through section

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.810 align:middle line:84%
in that spaceship
is just because they

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:17.692 align:middle line:90%
want to be observed.

00:35:17.692 --> 00:35:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
thought, John,

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:22.570 align:middle line:84%
that this program was some
kind of educational program,

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:26.830 align:middle line:84%
where they are slowly
trying to bring us along

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.820 align:middle line:90%
in little stages.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.940 align:middle line:90%
So let's let them see the craft.

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's let them see us.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's land.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.565 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk to them and
let's bring them along.

00:35:36.565 --> 00:35:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I think you're
absolutely right, George.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
we're looking at.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And the slow part of
the program is over.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:44.590 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's done,

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.125 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: It's done.

00:35:46.125 --> 00:35:46.930 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We are approaching
a crescendo where

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.197 align:middle line:84%
we are going to be
seeing not disclosure,

00:35:52.197 --> 00:35:54.280 align:middle line:84%
because disclosure is
supposedly from governments,

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.870 align:middle line:90%
and that's not going to happen.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:84%
What we're coming
to right now is

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.060 align:middle line:84%
revelation that is
going to be directly

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.250 align:middle line:84%
from the alien
visitors themselves,

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.160 align:middle line:84%
where they're done
bringing us along slowly.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And they are going to
reveal what they really are

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:10.180 align:middle line:90%
and what they're really doing.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you see, John,
how the ancients on this planet

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:17.897 align:middle line:84%
would have confused things
like this with angels and gods?

00:36:17.897 --> 00:36:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, yeah.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
have different segments

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.670 align:middle line:84%
of the population looking
at the same things

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:26.110 align:middle line:90%
through different filters.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Some people use
religious filters.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Some people use
scientific filters.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And others just use the filters
of their own common sense,

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and they see what's
really going on here.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
have to see these.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I understand more
and more when I see things like

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.520 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Erich von Daniken's theories
of the "Chariots of the Gods--"

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.487 align:middle line:90%
where people could confuse them.

00:36:48.487 --> 00:36:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, Absolutely.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you see something that
exhibits higher technology

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.840 align:middle line:90%
than yourself.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And you want to be able to
defer to it in some way.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
different people differ

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.300 align:middle line:90%
is different ways.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this case well
known among ufologists--

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:05.117 align:middle line:90%
this Turkey case?

00:37:05.117 --> 00:37:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Oh, yeah.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:90%
It's very well-known.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's difficult
for people to make that leap.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.290 align:middle line:84%
They need that leap of saying
this is what it purports to be.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.460 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.810 align:middle line:90%
This is authentic.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:25.870 align:middle line:84%
We've got to stop putting off
the cynicism and the holding

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:30.070 align:middle line:84%
back, telling what people
can really believe in.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what it
actually purports to be.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
scramble jets or anything

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:36.522 align:middle line:90%
like that in Turkey?

00:37:36.522 --> 00:37:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I don't
believe that they did.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Because this incident
was over so quickly.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what I believe.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever we do scramble
in the Western world--

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.670 align:middle line:84%
whenever we scramble
jets after genuine UFOs,

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.500 align:middle line:84%
it always ends up to
be a farce anyway.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:90%
They never catch up.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:55.890 align:middle line:90%
The UFOs disappear.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.115 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Either
they catch them or--

00:37:57.115 --> 00:37:58.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they catch us.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.425 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: --they catch up.

00:37:59.425 --> 00:38:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And they do loop de
loops around our jets,

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:03.189 align:middle line:84%
and over-unders,
and face to faces.

00:38:03.189 --> 00:38:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty embarrassing
whenever it happens.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.688 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want with us?

00:38:06.688 --> 00:38:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Are they taunting us?

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: No, I believe that
they want connection with us.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're doing
the program that you said,

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.270 align:middle line:84%
bringing us-- or what
they have been doing--

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.920 align:middle line:84%
bringing us along
slowly, letting us

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.960 align:middle line:84%
observe them, letting us
contact them, and be with them,

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.090 align:middle line:90%
and bring us along slowly.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.559 align:middle line:84%
And so like I said, that
part is over already.

00:38:28.559 --> 00:38:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And so we're at a
new part right now.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.224 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might this craft
have been similar to what

00:38:32.224 --> 00:38:34.480 align:middle line:90%
happened at Roswell in 1947?

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: It might be.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:37.000 align:middle line:90%
But I don't believe so.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened in
Roswell in 1947 was something--

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.494 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
a physical craft--

00:38:43.494 --> 00:38:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That crashed.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --that was crashed,
and that was actually planted

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:54.340 align:middle line:84%
for purposes of
passing on technology--

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And bodies.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: --to us.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and bodies as well.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And to make us believe
that alien visitors are

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:90%
completely physical in nature.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, these
look like to me

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.952 align:middle line:84%
with what I could see
to be the alien grays.

00:39:06.952 --> 00:39:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: That's
what they appear.

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To you, too?

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.088 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, that's
what they appear to be,

00:39:11.088 --> 00:39:15.490 align:middle line:84%
especially if you watch the
film under very high resolution.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:19.330 align:middle line:84%
They appear to be the classic
grays that we all think of.

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
want us to see, too.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.214 align:middle line:84%
So we have to bear
that in mind, also.

00:39:25.214 --> 00:39:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when they
disappeared-- when they

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:90%
were gone, what did they do?

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Blink away or just zoom off?

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.974 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Pretty
much blinked away.

00:39:32.974 --> 00:39:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.223 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: It looks like a zoom.

00:39:35.223 --> 00:39:39.040 align:middle line:84%
But, really, they just
blinked out of there.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, that is strange,
and it's not human technology.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does that tell you
about their propulsion system?

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Or are they traveling
through dimensions?

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
there is propulsion.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It seems like what
they are doing is

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.040 align:middle line:90%
traveling through dimensions.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:58.570 align:middle line:84%
They are achieving different
levels of existence that we

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.670 align:middle line:90%
just cannot do.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they just
blink in and blink out?

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I believe this is
all a question of wormholes

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:10.714 align:middle line:84%
and gateways, not
interstellar traveler.

00:40:10.714 --> 00:40:11.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it's--

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
they're taking people, John?

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, I do.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I believe they
are taking people.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through these wormholes
and they're not coming back?

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.845 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, especially
because of the abduction

00:40:20.845 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:84%
numbers we have
in this country--

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: --every year.

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.080 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
FBI reports, which

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.240 align:middle line:84%
are done every year
in this country,

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.832 align:middle line:84%
there's an average
of 33,000 people--

00:40:32.832 --> 00:40:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who disappear.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --who
disappear without a trace,

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:43.540 align:middle line:84%
without blood splatters,
without any clues whatsoever.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.060 align:middle line:90%
And they're just gone.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that cannot
be explained by probabilities.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.435 align:middle line:84%
That can't be
explained physically.

00:40:52.435 --> 00:40:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
not murdered and hidden

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:55.210 align:middle line:90%
away somewhere.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Not that many.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Right.

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:57.490 align:middle line:90%
These are not murders.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.230 align:middle line:90%
These are just disappearances.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.642 align:middle line:90%
Completely gone.

00:41:01.642 --> 00:41:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what would you
tell a panel of ufologists

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.740 align:middle line:90%
about something like this case?

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I would tell
them that we need--

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.260 align:middle line:84%
now that the paradigm is
changing right now, where

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.160 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream isn't allowed to
just bury these things anymore

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the way that they have,
we need to bring back

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:23.350 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these cases that
have such obvious authenticity

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.340 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.810 align:middle line:90%
And we need to bring these back.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And we need to re-examine,
re-expose, and show them

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to the public, and
tell them, this

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:34.330 align:middle line:90%
is what you were lied to about.

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
look at this again.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And we need to say,
hey, this is real.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:middle line:84%
This is very possibly
non-terrestrial alien visitors

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.690 align:middle line:90%
reaching out to us.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:47.650 align:middle line:90%
And we need to respond.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:50.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: 2011-- there
was an incredible UFO

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.740 align:middle line:10%
case in the Middle East
near the Temple Mount

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:56.560 align:middle line:10%
I'll let you look at this
with us, John, and tell us,

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.870 align:middle line:10%
what are we looking at here?

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:00.580 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: You're
looking at a plasma.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:01.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: There it
is on the far right.

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:03.911 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, that is
descending from the sky.

00:42:03.911 --> 00:42:06.430 align:middle line:10%
It's 1:00 in the morning
in Jerusalem, Israel.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:09.042 align:middle line:84%
And that is the Temple
Mount where it settles.

00:42:09.042 --> 00:42:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It hovers
right above it, right?

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Exactly.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.610 align:middle line:90%
And it settles like--

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:14.860 align:middle line:90%
it's rock-steady still.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.480 align:middle line:90%
It just stops there.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And it just holds.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.220 align:middle line:84%
It holds for a while,
then it gives off

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:25.000 align:middle line:84%
an explosion of
energy that covers all

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.524 align:middle line:90%
of Jerusalem for a millisecond.

00:42:26.524 --> 00:42:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
we're looking at

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.280 align:middle line:84%
is Jerusalem there
at the city, right?

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: And it just
goes back up straight out--

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: --into the night.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:39.936 align:middle line:84%
And this was on
January 11 in 2011.

00:42:39.936 --> 00:42:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, there's
a bigger picture of it.

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Look how huge that is.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.421 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: It's a plasma.

00:42:44.421 --> 00:42:45.980 align:middle line:90%
It's filled with light.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.640 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I like to
call UFOs plasmas, instead of

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.440 align:middle line:90%
the old UFO.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
people say about this?

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They said it was
real and they filmed it.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.940 align:middle line:84%
They filmed it from
many different angles.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Groups of tourists who were
up at 1:00 in the morning.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.090 align:middle line:90%
There goes the energy flash.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at it.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that go?

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just poof.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.361 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: There it goes.

00:43:06.361 --> 00:43:10.441 align:middle line:84%
And this video was taken by
a group of American tourists.

00:43:10.441 --> 00:43:11.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the Temple Mount.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:10%
There is the object descending.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Stops, hovers.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: It's
filled with light.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
hangs there for a bit.

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:24.770 align:middle line:84%
It gives of the
incredible flash of energy

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:29.830 align:middle line:84%
that covers all of Jerusalem
for one millisecond

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.637 align:middle line:90%
and then shoots straight up.

00:43:31.637 --> 00:43:33.595 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This was witnessed
by a lot of people?

00:43:33.595 --> 00:43:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Many, many people
that all filmed the same thing.

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Here's four groups
of people that

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:42.370 align:middle line:90%
filmed the same exact thing.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And these are the side
by sides of the videos.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gosh, I wonder
what these people thought.

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: They screamed.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.260 align:middle line:10%
And they said they have arrived.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
told that night.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:59.764 align:middle line:84%
They have arrived here in
Jerusalem at the Temple Mount.

00:43:59.764 --> 00:44:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
a message here.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.596 align:middle line:84%
There had to have
been a message--

00:44:02.596 --> 00:44:05.300 align:middle line:90%
why they visited that spot.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.170 align:middle line:90%
There it goes.

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: A flash straight up.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.971 align:middle line:84%
And, George, that night
in Jerusalem there was--

00:44:10.971 --> 00:44:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then another witness.

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.094 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --another--
yeah, there were many.

00:44:14.094 --> 00:44:19.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, interestingly, the night
this happened on January 11,

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.240 align:middle line:10%
it was--

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:25.330 align:middle line:10%
by the next day, all of
these videos were taken down.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:26.330 align:middle line:90%
They were all taken down

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:29.240 align:middle line:90%
How did we get these?

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: YouTube.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the viral
nature of the internet.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They already hit.

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They were
put back later on.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were dramatic.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.994 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah,
but at the time,

00:44:39.994 --> 00:44:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
an intelligence

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:46.760 align:middle line:84%
group that had people in Israel
working on something else.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And those people stopped
their work when this happened.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And they all called us
back on the East Coast,

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and they told us
they've arrived.

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:56.500 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:57.880 align:middle line:90%
They're in Jerusalem.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be seeing
all the videos.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And you guys are going to see
that the alien visitors have

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.220 align:middle line:90%
arrived in Jerusalem.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we haven't had
any cases at the Temple Mount

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:07.600 align:middle line:90%
since then, have we?

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: No, but these
people in particular

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:12.010 align:middle line:84%
said that there were
other vehicles that

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:14.942 align:middle line:84%
arrived at other holy sites
around Jerusalem as well.

00:45:14.942 --> 00:45:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In that time period?

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: In the same time
period that same night.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:90%
That same night.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
message here somewhere.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Right.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:26.500 align:middle line:84%
However, I was told that
the elite powers in control

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.220 align:middle line:84%
have a squad of people,
that all they do

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:33.580 align:middle line:84%
is take down genuine
incidences of the paranormal,

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.040 align:middle line:84%
take it down and
replace it with fakes.

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
trying to avoid what

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.440 align:middle line:84%
happened when this
video first came out.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So people would
say, oh, that's not real.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a fake.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:45.778 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: They replaced
the videos that we just saw.

00:45:45.778 --> 00:45:49.060 align:middle line:84%
They replaced them with
these fake looking, CGI

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:54.977 align:middle line:90%
sort of red dots in the sky.

00:45:54.977 --> 00:45:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that the millions and
millions of people who went

00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:00.190 align:middle line:90%
to see Dome of the Rock UFO--

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:03.400 align:middle line:84%
they all were confronted with
these fakes, these CGI fakes.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.170 align:middle line:90%
They say, OK, this isn't real.

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:07.497 align:middle line:84%
And so the awakening
was stopped.

00:46:07.497 --> 00:46:08.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they want.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were these physical?

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Were they plasma?

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I believe
that was a plasma.

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:15.785 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
that was a plasma.

00:46:15.785 --> 00:46:18.460 align:middle line:84%
But it was intelligently
guided, and it was

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.832 align:middle line:90%
a real vehicle of some sort.

00:46:19.832 --> 00:46:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly, it's
not a ball of lightning.

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:22.360 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Right.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:25.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, so many things
are happening on this planet--

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.490 align:middle line:90%
astounding things.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.505 align:middle line:84%
No wonder you keep
doing what you're doing.

00:46:32.505 --> 00:46:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah, because
the mainstream authorities

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.190 align:middle line:90%
are holding the line.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:40.480 align:middle line:84%
They're holding the line, using
mainstream science, mainstream

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.830 align:middle line:90%
media.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And they are holding the line
against us getting the football

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.120 align:middle line:84%
into the end zone, which
is getting the real truth,

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.920 align:middle line:84%
breaking down that
wall against the truth,

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.650 align:middle line:84%
that they are holding
to make us believe

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:59.140 align:middle line:84%
that we are living in this
false version of reality.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the feedback
the next day after this?

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: The feedback was,
what happened to the videos--

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:09.290 align:middle line:90%
these videos we just watched?

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.690 align:middle line:90%
They were all gone.

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:13.120 align:middle line:90%
They had all disappeared.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And there were these weak,
fake versions put up.

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Within 24 hours they
had been put up.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Instantly.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:23.985 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how much
resources do you

00:47:23.985 --> 00:47:26.080 align:middle line:84%
need to be able to do
something like that?

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there were
all these fake videos

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that were up instead under the
title, Dome of the Rock UFO.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable case.

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you think there's
any connotation

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.150 align:middle line:90%
behind their visitation?

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Because the Middle
East is a tinderbox.

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.220 align:middle line:84%
There's problems
there all the time.

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.017 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the ETs were
trying to send us a message?

00:47:45.017 --> 00:47:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, I
think they're always

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.940 align:middle line:84%
trying to send a message
in everything that they do.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stop
fighting or something.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
rumor in Jerusalem

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:59.140 align:middle line:84%
that night that the vehicle that
came to the Dome of the Rock

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.070 align:middle line:84%
had actually delivered a baby,
if you want to get weird,

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:02.120 align:middle line:90%
George--

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.744 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do mean
delivered a baby?

00:48:03.744 --> 00:48:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: We have to consider
all data in intelligence work.

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was data
that there were

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:14.214 align:middle line:84%
rumors there had been a baby
in a bassinet delivered.

00:48:14.214 --> 00:48:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds a
little biblical to me.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, at the Dome
of the Rock that night.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.079 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where was the baby put?

00:48:21.079 --> 00:48:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: We don't know.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.350 align:middle line:84%
We were never able
to track it down.

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:25.600 align:middle line:90%
We were never able to find it.

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
the Second Coming?

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I don't
know what it was.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.180 align:middle line:84%
But no one was ever
able to find that baby.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But there were rumors,
raw data that people

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.430 align:middle line:84%
said from the ground that
they had seen a baby delivered

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:40.390 align:middle line:90%
by this vehicle.

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do people
ask for from you,

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:46.060 align:middle line:84%
John, when they talk to you
about some of these cases?

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.370 align:middle line:90%
What do they want to know?

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:52.465 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: What they want to
know is, what is real proof?

00:48:52.465 --> 00:48:54.747 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.747 --> 00:48:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good question.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.180 align:middle line:90%
What is real proof?

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Because that's all I am.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a scientist.

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an engineer.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.120 align:middle line:90%
All I do is investigate.

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.750 align:middle line:90%
That's all I've done.

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:07.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm an investigator.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm here
to always tell people

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:14.230 align:middle line:84%
is that evidence and proof is
not what people think it is.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean something
you just put in a test tube,

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
examine in a laboratory,

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.470 align:middle line:90%
and that's what proof means.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:21.820 align:middle line:90%
That's not what it is.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how are
you supposed to--

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:28.420 align:middle line:84%
how can you tell if something
is alien with its DNA

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.990 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have alien
DNA to back it up against,

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:33.490 align:middle line:90%
to compare it to?

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.450 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:36.940 align:middle line:90%
It's simple things like that--

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.200 align:middle line:90%
people just don't know.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.230 align:middle line:84%
People think if you get a DNA
sample of something, then,

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:42.250 align:middle line:90%
OK, we've got it.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.390 align:middle line:90%
We've got the proof.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:44.890 align:middle line:90%
You have nothing.

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you look at
the cases we've just looked

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.700 align:middle line:90%
at today with you--

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:54.970 align:middle line:84%
the 6-inch mummy, the space
shuttle and the little objects

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:58.780 align:middle line:84%
flying around, which you
say could be a mile long,

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:03.430 align:middle line:84%
the Dome of the Rock situation
as well and so many others--

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:05.620 align:middle line:84%
the little space people
that were peering

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.420 align:middle line:90%
through the spacecraft--

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.440 align:middle line:90%
what does this tell you?

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:11.480 align:middle line:84%
What are you convinced
is happening?

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.280 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be.

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you have a
conclusion by now.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yeah.

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Is that we have
alien visitors who

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.810 align:middle line:84%
are trying to reach
out to us all the time.

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
opposing force--

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:24.650 align:middle line:90%
irresistible opposing force--

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here?

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --here of mainstream
authorities that are determined

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.220 align:middle line:84%
to keep us from this knowledge,
even when it's right in front

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:34.390 align:middle line:90%
of our eyes--

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.070 align:middle line:84%
even when it's
completely obvious.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't
hide this stuff.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.531 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: They cannot hide it.

00:50:38.531 --> 00:50:41.110 align:middle line:84%
All they can do is
falsify after the fact.

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:41.980 align:middle line:90%
All they can do is--

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Falsify.

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --is mutter off
things like icicles, ice

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:48.340 align:middle line:90%
debris, and nonsense like that.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we're
still so culturally trained

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:54.286 align:middle line:90%
that people still believe.

00:50:54.286 --> 00:50:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was
going to say that.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.790 align:middle line:84%
People would be
more apt to believe

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:01.960 align:middle line:84%
what the government feeds them
than what you actually see.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, which is insane.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.230 align:middle line:90%
That is insanity.

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Because these things are
reaching out for us every day.

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:10.690 align:middle line:84%
They are being shown to us
right in front of our faces,

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and yet, we are still
deferring to NASA

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and government entities that are
just doing what they're told.

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.670 align:middle line:84%
They are told to cover
this up, and so they just

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:22.660 align:middle line:90%
follow the orders.

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:23.480 align:middle line:90%
They follow orders.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:23.720 align:middle line:90%
That's all they do.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the
last couple cases--

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:29.260 align:middle line:84%
the Dome of the Rock
video and the spaceship

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.570 align:middle line:84%
with the little aliens
in there-- both of those

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:33.460 align:middle line:90%
were compelling as all get up.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:34.930 align:middle line:90%
The one by the shuttle--

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:37.780 align:middle line:84%
all right, I could
say are particles.

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:38.800 align:middle line:90%
They got too close.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they aren't
a mile in diameter.

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're just up
front to the camera.

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the little
6-inch mummy.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's a deformed
fetus, or a little person,

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.200 align:middle line:84%
or a little occupant
from a little spaceship.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.041 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: We don't know.

00:51:56.041 --> 00:51:58.270 align:middle line:90%
But here's what we do know.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:03.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a major scandal the
way that they covered that up,

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:07.449 align:middle line:84%
with the final conclusion on
the Atacama Desert 6-inch mummy.

00:52:07.449 --> 00:52:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're still
covering it up, right?

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Because they're
still covering it up.

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:13.270 align:middle line:84%
But not only that,
we're finding out now

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that this has happened
all over the world.

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:19.810 align:middle line:84%
The same script has been
followed by mainstream science

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:22.300 align:middle line:90%
and laboratories to cover these.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It's because these
things-- these duendes--

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:26.150 align:middle line:90%
these things--

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The little people.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.456 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --the
little people are

00:52:28.456 --> 00:52:30.170 align:middle line:90%
being found all over the world.

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:33.614 align:middle line:84%
We just had another
incident in Kyshtym, Russia.

00:52:33.614 --> 00:52:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How small are they?

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Just in Russia
where this other mummy was

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:38.540 align:middle line:90%
a foot tall.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:42.170 align:middle line:84%
It had a lot of the same
characteristics as the Atacama.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The cranial like that?

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:46.068 align:middle line:84%
And except-- it was even
weirder, a little more

00:52:46.068 --> 00:52:47.500 align:middle line:90%
reptilian looking.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.280 align:middle line:90%
And it was a 1-foot mummy.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they have a tail?

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: I don't believe so.

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But it had very much
a dozen anomalies that

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.610 align:middle line:90%
made it different from human.

00:52:57.610 --> 00:52:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was about a
foot tall in an area

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that had been rumored to have
these creatures running around

00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.060 align:middle line:90%
like duendes.

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:05.950 align:middle line:90%
And this thing was forgotten.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.360 align:middle line:90%
It was DNA tested.

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And the Russian
federal authorities--

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:10.540 align:middle line:84%
the Russian
government authorities

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:12.940 align:middle line:84%
all did the
preliminaries honestly.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.220 align:middle line:84%
They said this appears
to be non-human.

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:19.540 align:middle line:84%
They said it's a male,
and it's not a fetus.

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.460 align:middle line:90%
It's obviously not a fetus.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But then they did
the deep testing.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And they came up with this
whole cloth conclusion

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:28.930 align:middle line:90%
that said, oh, it's just human.

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:30.730 align:middle line:84%
No explanation
further than that.

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:31.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a human.

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:35.890 align:middle line:84%
It's insane-- the lengths to
which mainstream authorities

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:38.350 align:middle line:84%
are going to keep us from
getting across that goal line.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we going to get
the answers eventually, John,

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.870 align:middle line:84%
with people like
you pounding away?

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, we will as
long as we don't give up

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and keep working these cases
with true investigators.

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Not scientists, but
true investigators.

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And we need to have
our own laboratories.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:57.640 align:middle line:90%
That also.

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:58.973 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's true, too.

00:53:58.973 --> 00:54:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But again, you're going to be
subject to compromise there.

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Because people are going to
say that it's their laboratory.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:09.520 align:middle line:84%
We want an independent
laboratory to investigate this.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Can you find those?

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:15.960 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: No, not under the
current system of peer review,

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:21.370 align:middle line:10%
of grants, of endowments, of
where the scientific mainstream

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:26.290 align:middle line:10%
is so controlled by the system
that they operate under.

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:28.810 align:middle line:84%
There's no way they can be
honest about these topics.

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:30.834 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people
track your work, John?

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:31.750 align:middle line:90%
How can they find you?

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:35.590 align:middle line:10%
>>DESOUZA: People can always
find me on johntamabooks.com,

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:39.670 align:middle line:10%
and also find me on my
Facebook, my YouTube channel

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:43.060 align:middle line:10%
and also, I'm in partnership
with Gaia TV as well.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gaia loves you.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Will we get the answers to this?

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, we will if
only through revelation,

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:56.320 align:middle line:84%
which will come directly
from alien visitors to us.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you think this
visitation could happen when?

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: I think it
could happen very soon.

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we handle it?

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:04.330 align:middle line:90%
The people?

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, we will.

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it will
come directly to us,

00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:12.370 align:middle line:84%
we who are open to these things,
not to the White House lawn

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:14.530 align:middle line:90%
or to Washington, DC.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:16.800 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come
directly to we

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.387 align:middle line:84%
who are open to these realities
and who are already prepared.

00:55:20.387 --> 00:55:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Because like you
said, George, they've

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:24.912 align:middle line:84%
been bringing us along
slowly for a long time.

00:55:24.912 --> 00:55:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, thanks
for being on the program.

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Thanks, George.

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:27.960 align:middle line:90%
It's been great.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just witnessed
four incredible cases.

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.140 align:middle line:10%
And there are many more
like that out there.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.350 align:middle line:10%
And we will get you
these answers eventually.

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:39.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
