00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
back to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And what a special guest I have
for you today, Carmen Boulter,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.640 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:84%
She is a noted
author, researcher,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:84%
documentary producer,
documentary,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:90%
of course, The Pyramid Code."

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.804 align:middle line:84%
She's working on a new one
called "The New Atlantis."

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Carmen, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:84%
It's always fun
to have you here.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARMEN BOULTER: Nice
to see you, George.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always just fantastic.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And your work is
absolutely amazing.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.581 align:middle line:84%
How did you get started
into all of this?

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
talk about things you're

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.662 align:middle line:90%
discovering about Atlantis.

00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, it started
when I was a little girl.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.564 align:middle line:84%
And I started having
past life visions

00:00:55.564 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
what I was looking at.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I went and
looked in costume books

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and the encyclopedia, and trying
to figure out what it was.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up
that it was Egypt.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think I've
been basically chasing

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:84%
around my past life
memories this whole time.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And how did you get involved
with studying Atlantis?

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, that
name comes up a lot.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a myth
that we can't let go of.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So people are endlessly
curious about it.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when you
look at documentaries,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
it seems like they want to put
it back into the bin of myth.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.440 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to bring it out.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the evidence
has been destroyed.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very obscure.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really
curious, because I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:84%
think there's a way to
ground verifiable data

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:84%
with the possibility
of Atlantis.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we didn't
have Plato, Carmen,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:84%
would we even know
about Atlantis?

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Maybe not.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: He was the
most famous person

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:90%
that talked about it.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Yet, people say that
perhaps he was heartbroken

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:90%
because Socrates was poisoned.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And he had to make up a story
to make himself feel better.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And that it wasn't 9,000
years, it was 9,000 moons.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And they keep on making things
up about what Plato was saying.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Now, was he making things up?

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Or has it been difficult for
us to verify what he said?

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I sometimes think
that we know where Atlantis is

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and that for some reason, we're
holding back on telling people.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.695 align:middle line:90%
Why do I feel that way?

00:02:21.695 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Because it's true.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So I've actually spoken at
an International Conference

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:90%
in Indonesia last year.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And there were
lots of researchers

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:84%
that are talking about
physical evidence of Atlantis

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
having been in Asia, not
necessarily with the Atlantic

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Ocean.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a first.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But, what
I've also realized

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
is that in ancient
texts, they'll

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:84%
often say it's over here,
when it's over there.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
So then they can tell the whole
story and not have people go

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:90%
and find out.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's this thing
about mundane people.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:84%
If Atlantis had all these
riches and specialty woods

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and aromatherapy and all these
crops and that sort of thing,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
and gold and jewels, they didn't
want people to go and find it.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.104 align:middle line:84%
And so they'd say
it's over there.

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that's been really

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
misleading is the whole of
the ocean was the Atlantic.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.952 align:middle line:90%
And it was the world ocean--

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In those days
it was everything.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.868 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: It was everything.

00:03:15.868 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And so there's all this
thing about opposites,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:90%
so that we don't exactly know.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we've all gotten
confused about it.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But as well, Atlantis was a
worldwide seafaring culture.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:90%
And so they colonized.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
little pockets all over.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of what Atlantis--
what Plato said about Atlantis

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:84%
being 32 points, and all
the places that have been

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:84%
designated to
possibly be Atlantis--

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Antarctica, Crete,
goes on and on,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Santorini, the high
Altiplano in South America--

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.679 align:middle line:84%
all these different things have
check marks of what Plato said.

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
say well Santorini

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:90%
didn't have elephants.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:90%
So they made it up.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: So where
are all these points?

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And there is one place,
where all these points--

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where
might that be?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're revealing
today on "Beyond Belief."

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: The Sunda
Strait, Sundaland,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.269 align:middle line:84%
which is actually where
the land mass broke off--

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big was this mass?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Huge.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
My information now
from my research

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.191 align:middle line:84%
is that there were four
disasters, not one.

00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:21.149 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like after the
other boom, boom, boom?

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: No.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.329 align:middle line:84%
Well the one that most
everybody's talking about

00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:25.496 align:middle line:90%
is 11,600 and some 60 years.

00:04:25.496 --> 00:04:26.295 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:26.295 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:90%
That was the period, right?

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, and that
was the last major flood.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: So before that,
18,500 years ago, and Dr. Paul

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
LaViolette confirms the idea
of a solar flare happening

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.840 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm talking
about things,

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking to triangulate,
cross-reference, not just

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:90%
get it from one place.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.914 align:middle line:84%
So there's other evidence at
58,000 years and 85,000 years.

00:04:50.914 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
kept getting blasted.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.121 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: They kept
getting blasted.

00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And right there,
in the Sunda Strait

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:84%
is where three
tectonic plates meet

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:90%
and there's three volcanoes.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And so it just kept breaking
apart, and perhaps getting

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:90%
smaller.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But it stayed there
until the very end.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:84%
But when it was thriving,
and it was on the equator,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:84%
everything else
was in an Ice Age.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just
really interesting

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:84%
how we wouldn't have
understood how it went.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.380 align:middle line:90%
But worldwide seafaring culture.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding
is the first disaster

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:90%
flipped the poles.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:90%
And so the magnetic poles--

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that
would have occurred--

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.466 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: I'm thinking
that one was 58,000 years.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:34.266 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: OK.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Part of my research
has to do with chasing

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:90%
after my past lives.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So I had a past
life reading that

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
said that I was on an
evacuation committee--

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.205 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was there, too.

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: --when there was
advanced knowledge that there

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:90%
was going to be a catastrophe.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And what were we going
to do to help the people?

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Or to help the planet?

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:90%
That's when I think--

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
now I'm coming really
strongly on this--

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.109 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramids started to
be built in various places.

00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But often a pyramid, if you go
through the top of the pyramid

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:84%
through the center
of the Earth, you'll

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
come out the other
end at a volcano.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah-ha.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: So there was
something about this torquing--

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like that
movie "Journey to the Center

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth."

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And the weight of the
pyramids, the location

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
of them on ley
lines, this sort of,

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.240 align:middle line:84%
thing was designed to
stabilize the planet

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:90%
so that wouldn't happen.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
Grand Central Atlantis,

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:84%
let's say, in
Sundaland, then they

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:90%
would send out various groups.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to think of it--
we have various groups here.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Think about hip hop kids.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.239 align:middle line:90%
And they have their own style.

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:38.487 align:middle line:90%
They have their own music.

00:06:38.487 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:90%
They have their own preferences.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And you think firemen
and ballerinas--

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:84%
so it's like the
Mayans were one group.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Chinese
were another group.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:90%
And the Vedic Indians.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:90%
And they all went to colonize.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
what they looked like,

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
they had different styles,
feathers in their hair,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
different music,
that sort of thing.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.888 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
it could have been

00:06:57.888 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:84%
what I'm calling the third
party hypothesis where they all

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
came from a similar
source, but then

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:90%
they each had their own style.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They branched out.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And then they
each had their own style.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:84%
So we end up thinking
that they're all separate.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But they all had civilizing
culture, commerce, astronomy,

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.750 align:middle line:84%
geometry, all these sacred
geometry, all this knowledge.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.583 align:middle line:84%
They all had-- actually,
if you look at it--

00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
they all had similar
knowledge, similar symbols.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How advanced were they?

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Extremely.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Much more than I think
that we even understand,

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.820 align:middle line:90%
that we couldn't even guess.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And so lately, there's been some
information about Antarctica

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.325 align:middle line:90%
and what they're finding there.

00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
I think they're doing steam
excavation in Antarctica.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're
finding-- now, again,

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't have
verification on this--

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.700 align:middle line:84%
but extremely sophisticated
labs and animals

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.480 align:middle line:84%
in stasis that are not
what we knew, but really

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated technology.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So I think it was a very,
very incredible peaceful time.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were the Atlanteans
the ones that in the Bible God

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.570 align:middle line:84%
created the flood to destroy
them because of whatever they

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:90%
were doing at the time?

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Well, good point.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is,
is if corruption

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.372 align:middle line:84%
is causal to flooding,
I think we're well

00:08:10.372 --> 00:08:12.080 align:middle line:84%
overdue to be completely
under the water.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're going
to get flooded again.

00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:14.745 align:middle line:90%
Be ready.

00:08:14.745 --> 00:08:16.744 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Because there's
plenty of corruption.

00:08:16.744 --> 00:08:20.382 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is, again, one
of the misnomers that make us

00:08:20.382 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:90%
think that they were corrupt.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were fighting
and they started a war

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:90%
in Athens and all that.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.563 align:middle line:84%
But that's kind of like when
you and I have talked often

00:08:26.563 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:90%
about the Egyptians.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And the warring stuff happened
later 19th, 20th Dynasty.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:84%
And the Predynastic times were
very peaceful and civilized.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
So dynastic Egypt started
in 3113 BC and that's

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
when it started to
become more patriarchal.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
So I think that in Atlantis,
because there are so

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:84%
many years of it, many
processional cycles,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:84%
there was time for it to be
Golden and then in the Iron Age

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.237 align:middle line:84%
several times as this
was an ongoing culture.

00:08:54.237 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always
believed, Carmen,

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:84%
that these catastrophes,
these earth catastrophes, that

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:84%
have occurred were
misconstrued by the people

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:90%
of the day in the era.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they always said,
it's God that did this to us,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
when there were probably real
natural events that occurred,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:90%
and as you say four major ones.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And the last one,
of course, just

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:90%
wiped them out, that was it?

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we get tricked,
because Santorini, for example,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:84%
is one of the major
candidates for possibly having

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.930 align:middle line:90%
been Atlantis.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:84%
But if it was destroyed,
and it disappeared,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Santorini is still there.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's still there.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: We can
hear these things

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and they repeat it
over and over again.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And we go, OK,
Santorini could be it.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:90%
But, no, it would be gone.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:90%
So there's all these tricks.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And Things keep
getting repeated.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.500 align:middle line:84%
We end up giving up and
not really understanding

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:90%
how to look for it.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of evidence now

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.864 align:middle line:84%
about Java and that whole
area, and lots of researchers

00:09:45.864 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: It is.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that part of this
thing about Atlantis, Atlantic,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Straits of Gibraltar,
all of that,

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:84%
is it would make
Atlantis Western.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And this fits in--
and you know I've

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:90%
discussed this about King Tut.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
There was a big
thing about King Tut

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:84%
was Akhenaten was his
father, because that

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:90%
would have made King Tut white.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.265 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And I think
that DNA testing--

00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he was not.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: No.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.478 align:middle line:90%
And so, but that's the thing.

00:10:09.478 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
We want to keep the history
kind of making us look

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:90%
like we're the dominant ones.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:90%
And it may not be that.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The technology of
the Atlanteans at the time,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.602 align:middle line:90%
do they have flying machines?

00:10:22.602 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, that's
kind of hard to verify.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be plenty of
stories in the Vedic texts that

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:90%
describe that.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:90%
And I don't see why not.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.053 align:middle line:84%
I mean they were
highly sophisticated.

00:10:32.053 --> 00:10:34.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, they may
have been way advanced.

00:10:34.112 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But they
had everything.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:90%
It was paradise, really.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Aromatherapy and natural
woods and very special things,

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and a very
sophisticated lifestyle.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
money, government

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
didn't work like ours does,
and it left people at peace

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:90%
to be creative.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
they did it right.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yeah.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
what's important to me

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:84%
about studying it is what of
those values can we bring back?

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.237 align:middle line:84%
Because really in this world,
we're in a crisis of values.

00:11:04.237 --> 00:11:05.944 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, there's
no doubt about that.

00:11:05.944 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:90%
And I want to get into that.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
they had foreknowledge

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:90%
of their disasters.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Maybe not the first
time, but certainly after.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that there was
a real strategy to do something

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:90%
to stabilize the planet.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.216 align:middle line:84%
But then there was
all different things.

00:11:21.216 --> 00:11:23.495 align:middle line:84%
And you hear people
talking about a solar flare

00:11:23.495 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:84%
or a comet hit, a
magnetic reversal,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:90%
they put it all together in one.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tsunami.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.038 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But they put
it all together in one.

00:11:30.038 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they were
individual disasters that

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.630 align:middle line:84%
happened and then
there was a recovery.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the last event, did
the entire island or continent

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:90%
just sink?

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yep.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:90%
That's my understanding.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: So it
was breaking apart.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:90%
So if you look--

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and I've done a lot of
studying of indigenous tribes.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And right from Easter
Island up through Asia,

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.549 align:middle line:84%
that land could have
been all together.

00:11:59.549 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And they have the same kinds of
red, white, and black colors.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:84%
They build their
boats the same ways.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:90%
They have similar style.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And then gradually, it
broke apart, broke apart,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:84%
broke apart, to the
point where now, it's

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.470 align:middle line:90%
just a scattering of islands.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Carmen, all
around this planet

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:84%
there are ley lines,
special points of power

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.430 align:middle line:90%
points around this planet.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.597 align:middle line:84%
What exactly are
these ley lines?

00:12:21.597 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, you can call
them dragon lions as well.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Chinese call them.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost points where
the energy flow is interrupted.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:90%
And then it makes a power spot.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And so they're connected
in many different patterns.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:90%
And they're all over the world.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But notably, there's
going to be sacred sites

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and pyramids and that sort
of thing on these ley lines.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
was part of the grid that

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.990 align:middle line:84%
helped to stabilize with
the weight of the pyramids.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, too,
you'll have a pyramid--

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.323 align:middle line:84%
you go through the top, through
the center of the Earth,

00:12:52.323 --> 00:12:53.870 align:middle line:90%
you'll come out at a volcano.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Like the Great Pyramid, for
example, Haleakala in Hawaii

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is on the other
side of that one.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
new theory of how

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids could have
worked to stabilize

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.470 align:middle line:90%
the energy of the planet.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Edgar Cayce, the
great American prophet,

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:84%
talked about the
Hall of Records.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:84%
He said that they were
in Central America,

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:84%
in Bimini, and at the
base of the Sphinx.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe that in
Atlantis that information was

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:90%
what these Hall of Records.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Were?

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm convinced
the Atlanteans may

00:13:26.315 --> 00:13:27.450 align:middle line:90%
have become the Egyptians.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Oh, yes.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:90%
I really do think that.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:84%
At first, I didn't know
how to verify that,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
or how to even make
some links with it,

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:middle line:84%
but the more I do my
research, the more I'm

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:84%
thinking that's
exactly what happened.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.005 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you say
beneath the paw of the--

00:13:42.005 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:84%
or he says under the
paw of the Sphinx.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And they have found some kind
of tomb down there, by the way.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:48.731 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Well, yes.

00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they don't
know what's in it.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: They are very
primitive equipment.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's these
documentaries that

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.060 align:middle line:84%
show a sledgehammer and a
plate and an arrow, which

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.685 align:middle line:84%
isn't nearly sophisticated
enough for my liking.

00:13:59.685 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And there's cavities.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Like I spent a lot of time
in and around the body

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:84%
of the Sphinx and there
are several cavities.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:84%
The inner chamber of the heart
of the Sphinx and that sort

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.756 align:middle line:90%
And there's something to it.

00:14:08.756 --> 00:14:11.020 align:middle line:84%
But it wouldn't
be a huge chamber,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
but with a PhD in
linguistics, I understand

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
how just a little turn
of phrase, a preposition,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.570 align:middle line:90%
can make it different.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So under, let's say,
beneath, and in front of,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
so I thought that there was a
lot of treasures in the Sphinx

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.300 align:middle line:90%
temple.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.566 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep going
that's where Hawara is.

00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:29.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's the whole thing.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:90%
But by the Great Pyramid.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Well it's actually,
the pyramid of Hawara.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And so you and I
have discussed that.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Where using ground
penetrating radar,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and high definition
satellite scans,

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that have the capability of
going six kilometers deep.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's DPS.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.938 align:middle line:90%
And it can go through layers.

00:14:44.938 --> 00:14:47.699 align:middle line:84%
So normal GPS, if you hit
one layer, like this chair,

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
you can't go through the chair,
through the floor, and to see

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:90%
what's under the ground.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This will.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: This will.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we found a
huge complex in front

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:90%
of the pyramid of Hawara.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
With one layer that's the
ceilings are 20 meters deep.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
is 40 meters deep.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But there's 63
chambers, six of which

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.395 align:middle line:84%
are bigger than Olympic
sized swimming pools.

00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think on
the continent of Atlantis,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:90%
they had structures like this?

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:90%
Who would know, I guess?

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, the thing
is, now I've been talking

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.830 align:middle line:90%
to the people from GEOSCANS--

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.530 align:middle line:84%
which is the system
that works this--

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:90%
and they share their desktop.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And they show me things
that they've found.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.855 align:middle line:90%
And so much of it is underwater.

00:15:32.855 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they can
find things underwater?

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Huge
complexes underwater,

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:90%
like we're talking big.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.754 align:middle line:84%
And all over the place
passageways, networks,

00:15:41.754 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and there's more and
more of that being found.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In these regions?

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.835 align:middle line:84%
There's more and more of that
being found all the time.

00:15:46.835 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's weird.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: It is.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And you know it,
makes us wonder.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:84%
At first when GEOSCANs
came out, there

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.471 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a lot of verifiability
and reliability.

00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a great story.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.011 align:middle line:90%
I haven't heard of this before.

00:15:57.011 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Validity
and reliability--

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.667 align:middle line:84%
validity, are you
really measuring

00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:90%
what you think you're measuring?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.385 align:middle line:84%
And reliability is,
if you keep testing

00:16:04.385 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
are you're going to find
what you were looking for?

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So the more that they do
scans, and some of it's

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:84%
been for governments to find
diamonds, to find gold, to find

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.191 align:middle line:90%
oil, gas--

00:16:12.191 --> 00:16:14.523 align:middle line:84%
and they don't like to do
that any more for oil and gas,

00:16:14.523 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
because it's destructive
to the planet--

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
but they go and they dig and
they find exactly at the depth,

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:84%
at the spot, what
they're looking for.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So governments don't necessarily
know to go and dig at Hawara,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:90%
not yet, they may.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's becoming
increasingly likely

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.564 align:middle line:84%
that what they're showing
in the scans is real.

00:16:33.564 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
those people on Atlantis

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:84%
were in the wrong place
at the wrong time?

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: No.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
paradise on Earth.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
lot of challenges

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and the civilization went
on 85,000 years maybe,

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:90%
a long time.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.954 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was
quite a successful thing.

00:16:49.954 --> 00:16:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And there were
challenges on the planet,

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:90%
as they always have been.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But I think they maintained
a certain credibility

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and cohesion and a very,
very high level of values

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.609 align:middle line:90%
that are exemplary.

00:17:03.609 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We see movies--

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.329 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood, of course,
depicts Atlantis

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:84%
as this area that had
a huge crystal which

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:84%
they could use to harness
power from the sun and things

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And that that could
be part of the reason

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:21.120 align:middle line:84%
why the Bermuda Triangle has all
these weird things happening.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Possible?

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:90%
Magnetic anomalies.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid structures are all
built on quartz crystal.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.502 align:middle line:84%
So what the unique thing
about quartz crystal is it

00:17:30.502 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:84%
has a double helix
going around it.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:84%
When it's under pressure,
it releases energy.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And so Valery Uvarov
in Tomsk, Russia,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:90%
has been building new pyramids.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be
as many as 33 pyramids.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 33.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.115 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Yes,
one in the center

00:17:47.115 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and concentric circles of
four pyramids around each one.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And he's got these huge crystals
that are like 14 feet high.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:90%
And they're--

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're huge.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Huge.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're embedded
into the workings.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So where you think there's
dead space in a pyramid, where

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
there's no chamber,
it's actually

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:90%
huge crystals under pressure.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.127 align:middle line:90%
And granite has quartz in it.

00:18:08.127 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's the principle.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that
crystal quartz could

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:84%
be generating energy and
transmitting with the sun

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely viable.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.681 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you've talked
about these structures that

00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:20.750 align:middle line:90%
are under water.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:84%
What about artifacts
from Atlantis?

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Have we found
anything that could

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
lead-- you know pots and
pans, anything like that?

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Well, it's--

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:90%
There's a new find in Turkey.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And again, it hasn't
come hot off the press.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a couple
of images of that.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things
are jewels, and gold,

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and emerald the size
of a credit card.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And all these statues
that supposedly look

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:90%
like from Egypt.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.500 align:middle line:84%
They look like they would have
come from the Amarna Period.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they did found
them, what, by excavation?

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:90%
Like this?

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: No.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.230 align:middle line:90%
There's a cave.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.700 align:middle line:90%
So I've been privy to this idea.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.600 align:middle line:90%
So you can see these are--

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's Egyptian.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.221 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Yes,
it looks Egyptian.

00:19:07.221 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's all the
gods and goddesses.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But what they're saying
is Akhenaten and Nefertiti

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
went to one god, which is really
what our religions have done,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:90%
not theirs.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a stash
that was found in Turkey.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you look over in the blue
circle, that's Akhenaten OK?

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:90%
There he is.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And then next picture
has a sarcophagus that rivals

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:90%
King Tut's.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is this made with?

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.454 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: It's
gold covering wood.

00:19:31.454 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gold covering wood.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: What these guys did
is they went to the back of one

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:84%
of these statues, they
peeled the gold off,

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and they took a
little piece of wood--

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Melted it down.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: No.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Carbon-14 dated it.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you mean those
who tested it.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: 11,600 years.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Which means these artifacts
would have come from Atlantis--

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:84%
we can speculate--
and arrived in Egypt.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which has
been the theory.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Which
is mind boggling.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've got Akhenaten
there and Amenhotep III,

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.516 align:middle line:90%
it could be that they--

00:20:04.516 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
put this together--

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:84%
but they were reflecting gods
and goddesses from before.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.475 align:middle line:84%
And it was different people
who were respecting them.

00:20:12.475 --> 00:20:13.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost
like passing down

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:90%
grandma's silver and jewels.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:84%
None of these artifacts--
and we're talking 10 rooms.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.430 align:middle line:90%
I've got 147 pictures.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to
go into a film shoot.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they closed the
border, Syrian border,

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:84%
got all the Americans
out of Turkey right

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:84%
when I was going to
go do this film shoot.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So all I have is the cell
phone pictures that they took.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:90%
But I've got nine videos.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.645 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are we
looking at here, Carmen?

00:20:37.645 --> 00:20:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: This is a sarcophagus
that rivals King Tut.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Now that's right
beside, in the same room

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:90%
as these other artifacts.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So these two
pictures go together.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:84%
But this kind of
neck that the vulture

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.820 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to the
Queen Hatshesut's images.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:90%
And she was in the 18th Dynasty.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like the
sarcophagus was ever opened.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So it could have been that
it was in an unfinished form.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.909 align:middle line:84%
But with this--
have you ever seen

00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:03.450 align:middle line:84%
anything that looks more like
King Tut's tomb or sarcophagus?

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what it looks like.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: That's
what it looks like.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's huge.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that a dusting
of gold on the outside?

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: It's all gold.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's dusty in there,
because everything was just

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.219 align:middle line:90%
thrown into this cave.

00:21:13.219 --> 00:21:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep looking
at these artifacts,

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:84%
there isn't a single arrowhead
or a spear or anything warring.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And based on my book, "Angels
and Archetypes an Evolutionary

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Map of Feminine Consciousness,"
feminine consciousness

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.979 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have all these
things that were of beauty.

00:21:26.979 --> 00:21:28.270 align:middle line:90%
And the goddesses are in there.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So we have Artemis and all
these different goddesses

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:35.920 align:middle line:84%
that are represented in jeweled
combs and these incredibly

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
gorgeous things that
have nothing warring.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to
think maybe these

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.030 align:middle line:84%
are treasures that came
all the way from Atlantis,

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
that kept changing hands, stick
them up, give us your stuff.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:90%
And then there came a point--

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:90%
and this is on the Silk Road--

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.792 align:middle line:90%
where they just had to stash it.

00:21:53.792 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were they seafaring?

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.344 align:middle line:84%
You think had big
wooden ships and they

00:21:57.344 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:90%
traveled all over the place?

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: There's
doubt about it.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:90%
They went all over the world.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
me, that they were

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
able to grow sprouts and
fruits and vegetables

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.417 align:middle line:84%
right on the ships
and desalinate water.

00:22:08.417 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like people
getting scurvy or getting sick.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was
just going to say.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
They had their Vitamin
C. That's amazing.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: They had it.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.934 align:middle line:84%
And they went all
over the world.

00:22:16.934 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And especially, when
there were disasters, but

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:90%
they ended up colonizing.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So some people, they
would go to colonize.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:23.350 align:middle line:90%
And they'd go back.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And so when we see possible
evidence of pyramids

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and Atlantis all
over the world, it

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.620 align:middle line:90%
would simply have been colonies.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
say that Atlantis was

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.010 align:middle line:90%
the focal point of the planet?

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A long time ago?

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost like
the cradle of civilization.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.250 align:middle line:84%
We think it was in
Iraq, but you're saying

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:90%
it could have been Atlantis.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Well, there, too.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So the Sumerians, the
Vedic Indians the Chinese,

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians, the Mayans,
yeah they're all connected.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.544 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All offshoots?

00:22:55.544 --> 00:22:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yeah, I think so.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you really examine their
symbols and what they knew,

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
the domains of what
they knew, it's

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:90%
more similar than different.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was in Cancun
several years ago.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And the people of that
culture are very small.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.900 align:middle line:84%
The buildings that were ancient
stone buildings and structures

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
had doorways, Carmen--
and you've seen them--

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:90%
that are maybe that tall.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean you'd really
somebody like my size would

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:90%
have to stoop under to get in.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Were they little
people of that day?

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: I'm smiling
because one of the things that

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.700 align:middle line:84%
my research has uncovered
is in that last disaster,

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:84%
there were four different races
that ended up getting wiped

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.480 align:middle line:90%
out--

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and hobbits, giants, and a
couple of versions of us,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:90%
homosapiens--

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:51.464 align:middle line:84%
well we're Homo sapien
sapiens, so I don't

00:23:51.464 --> 00:23:52.630 align:middle line:90%
want to get that word wrong.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But some versions of
us were wiped out.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So what we find is
remains in places.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And in this stash
in Turkey, there

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.820 align:middle line:84%
was a little being,
mummified little being.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
finding all over is

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
beings that are
giant and the bones

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and distended skulls all over,
Bolivia all over, all over.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Nephilim?

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, and I think
that can be a catch all.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Because you know, who did it?

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.650 align:middle line:90%
The Annunaki.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, Annunaki Nephilim.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Who did it?

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Aliens.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Who did it?

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:84%
The Annun-- well that
doesn't go in depth.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.036 align:middle line:84%
We could just sit here
go the Annunaki did it,

00:24:27.036 --> 00:24:28.030 align:middle line:90%
the Annunaki did it.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't explain much.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Who is that?

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: OK so this
is Gia, the giant.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
with photographs

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:84%
of a distended skull of
an eight foot six inch

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:90%
being from Bolivia.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And Marcia Moore has
recreated, by using

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.340 align:middle line:90%
a 3D program called Mudbox.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's putting
together what this being

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:90%
may have looked like.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.170 align:middle line:90%
And I've called her Gia.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, she looks human.

00:24:54.535 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And she's
got the distended skull.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:90%
And she's a giant.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.481 align:middle line:84%
So she's just working on her
eyes now to make her real.

00:24:59.481 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:84%
But we're recreating a real
3D model that will move

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.409 align:middle line:84%
and speculating about what
this being could have been.

00:25:05.409 --> 00:25:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost nine feet tall?

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yeah.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.593 align:middle line:84%
And there are some that
are even taller than that.

00:25:10.593 --> 00:25:14.905 align:middle line:84%
But this becomes part
of the storyline.

00:25:14.905 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And that would have been
normal in Atlantean times,

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:84%
perhaps before the disaster that
made that exceptionally rare.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Elongated skull.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Is she human or
extraterrestrial?

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well,
that's always going

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.860 align:middle line:84%
to be an issue,
like I keep saying,

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:90%
aliens, aliens, Annunaki.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean aren't we all star seeds?

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.280 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Where did it start?

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think we get this misnomer
that we're all running around

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.150 align:middle line:84%
in our vehicles,
scooters, whatever,

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:45.777 align:middle line:84%
and we think that
extraterrestrials

00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:46.610 align:middle line:90%
have to have a ship.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the beings
can be channeling through us.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't necessarily
need to be in ships.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So the extraterrestrials--
it's something again,

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.789 align:middle line:84%
I think that these terms
and the way they're used

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:84%
have been confusing us more
than giving us information.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly though,
she had an elongated skull,

00:26:05.417 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:90%
based on what I could see.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.875 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And
what that would do

00:26:07.875 --> 00:26:09.717 align:middle line:84%
is give more room
for the pineal gland.

00:26:09.717 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland
is the connection

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
to spirit and all this psychic
nature and that sort of thing.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when we don't really
understand the abilities

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:84%
that they had to create the
technology, to bilocate,

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
teleport, all that
sort of thing,

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.050 align:middle line:84%
we're not used to
that, because we're

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.080 align:middle line:84%
in a dumbed-down state
with a smaller pineal gland

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.380 align:middle line:84%
that's even getting
less useful to us

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
because something like
fluoride can calcify it.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now they say
that some of the babies

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:84%
have had their skulls
pulled to give that look.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so sure about that.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, you can see,
and sometimes researchers

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that are talking
about elongated skulls

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.190 align:middle line:84%
don't differentiate between the
fake ones and the natural ones.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.372 align:middle line:84%
So they could pull
them, but they would put

00:26:54.372 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:90%
bandages or different things.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Different cultures would
strap the children to--

00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:90%
See this is the--

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like this.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.895 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: That's the
original skull, though.

00:27:01.895 --> 00:27:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But you could see the
marks of where the thing

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.670 align:middle line:84%
that would have
forced the skull.

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:90%
See, that's the side view.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how
could that be human?

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.789 align:middle line:84%
Looks like the head
of an ant, a huge ant.

00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, I don't know
that it's that different.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.286 align:middle line:90%
It's just a distended skull.

00:27:18.286 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Nefertiti and
Akhenaten had them.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Tut had one.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
think it's an ET.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Not necessarily.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean I think that it's
too easy to just say

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:84%
it's alien because they're
here and they're all over.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's not like us now.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:90%
That they would bind the skull.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when they're
fake, you can

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.690 align:middle line:90%
see that it's a flattened zone.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.870 align:middle line:84%
You can see the ridge of
what would have made it fake.

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
they elongated a skull?

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Why
would they do that?

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:43.705 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:43.705 --> 00:27:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Because the ones
that were natural,

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
that had the larger pineal
gland and larger brain m

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.240 align:middle line:84%
would have been admired
because of their abilities,

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.530 align:middle line:90%
because of the--

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Godlike.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.983 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Yeah, but
the transmutation

00:27:58.983 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:84%
of the atom and you
know psychicness

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:90%
and all that sort of thing.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So when that was dwindling
or was becoming extinct,

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.290 align:middle line:84%
because of the big
flood, they would

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:90%
have tried to emulate that.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But we're finding
distended skulls

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:15.450 align:middle line:84%
even where I live
off Vancouver Island

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:90%
in the Indian traditions.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And Marcia Moore herself
came and visited me

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
when she was going to see
how one generation ago,

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:84%
natural distended skulls from
the North American Indians.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.741 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now back to
Atlantis, of course.

00:28:30.741 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Here's the complex.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is amazing.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.525 align:middle line:90%
Now where was this?

00:28:34.525 --> 00:28:35.802 align:middle line:90%
This is Egypt?

00:28:35.802 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: This is Hawara, what
I was talking about before.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:84%
The blue level, you
see, is completely

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.940 align:middle line:90%
separate from the red level.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the ceiling of the
blue level is 20 meters deep.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:90%
And red is 40.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.161 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could that
get buried so deeply?

00:28:51.161 --> 00:28:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well,
the thing is people

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:84%
think maybe it was
on the surface.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.390 align:middle line:90%
But I don't.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:55.880 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think it
was always underground?

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yeah.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Now in archeology--

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.313 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That makes sense.

00:28:59.313 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Older is deeper.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, that means,
and the other thing

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.265 align:middle line:84%
is on top of that was a
Ptolemaic layer during Anthony

00:29:06.265 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:90%
and Cleopatra's time.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that
was a Roman layer.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And so this was known
to be a site where

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:84%
people were doing
things and civilizing

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.240 align:middle line:90%
and the layers go up, up, up.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would they build
it underground like that?

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, we
don't really know

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.620 align:middle line:90%
that because of the technology.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.710 align:middle line:84%
But it stands to reason
that the lower level is

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.810 align:middle line:90%
going to be really, really old.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm suspecting
that the second one

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:90%
would have been Atlantean.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:30.490 align:middle line:90%
So maybe when we--

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is speculation--

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:84%
but when we first came to
colonize the planet, if you

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.060 align:middle line:84%
will, coming from off
planet, maybe there

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:41.110 align:middle line:84%
had to be orientation zones and
a place to put the equipment.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.750 align:middle line:90%
But these are unexcavated.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And these scans can
show different materials

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
like precious metals, and
pottery, and bone, and water,

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and cavities, and
that sort of thing.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.190 align:middle line:84%
But they're more
like storage units.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not like a temple.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.819 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is in the
Valley of the Kings in Egypt,

00:29:57.819 --> 00:29:59.235 align:middle line:84%
it's like snakes
and ladders where

00:29:59.235 --> 00:30:00.640 align:middle line:90%
you can go between the levels.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.207 align:middle line:84%
These levels are
completely separate.

00:30:02.207 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So it stands to
reason that they would

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.040 align:middle line:84%
have been completely
separate civilizations that

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.790 align:middle line:90%
would have put them there.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the purpose of the pyramids

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:09.790 align:middle line:90%
really were?

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people
believe that--

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Dunn believes
that they're power plants.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their own
theories, Carmen, yours too.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean they're similar,
they're all over the planet.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.770 align:middle line:84%
We're discovering
more and more of them.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Why that shape?

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.779 align:middle line:90%
And why that look?

00:30:27.779 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: So straight
sided pyramids

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.820 align:middle line:84%
have seven different
characteristics

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:31.980 align:middle line:90%
that makes them function.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:35.657 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think, again, a trap
is one right answer hypothesis

00:30:35.657 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:84%
that we get in school
with multiple choice--

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:90%
A, B, C, D--

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:90%
it's a power plant.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:39.970 align:middle line:90%
No, it's this.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:40.810 align:middle line:90%
No, it's that.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But nothing in ancient
Egypt, and probably

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:84%
in the distant ancient
world, is ever one thing.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.980 align:middle line:84%
It's multipurpose,
multi-dimensional,

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:84%
multifaceted, many,
many things went on.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a very
sophisticated technology.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.960 align:middle line:90%
And so, yes, power plant.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, stabilize the planet.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Yes, generate energy,
connect the earth grid,

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:84%
make passive imploding energy
instead of exploding energy

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:05.690 align:middle line:90%
which pollutes.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What minds would
create something like that?

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.841 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, you've
got to wonder, don't you?

00:31:09.841 --> 00:31:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And especially to repeat
it in so many places.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of the pyramids
that are being discovered now

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.560 align:middle line:84%
have got trees over the top,
like the Bosnian pyramids.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:90%
So they're prediluvian.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So when the big flood came,
it would have left layers

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:29.820 align:middle line:84%
like three to five feet of
silt, which then grew trees.

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Now in Egypt, when
it became desert,

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that blew away,
because Egypt used

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.080 align:middle line:84%
to be tropical,
semi-tropical, tropical.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of these
pyramids are completely

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.050 align:middle line:90%
covered in trees.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Now if we were able to take
a helicopter and shave them,

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:84%
we could see that
actually what's

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.110 align:middle line:90%
underneath is straight sided.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Dr. Sam Osmanagich

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:53.130 align:middle line:84%
has discovered by excavating
and finding geopolymer,

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.280 align:middle line:84%
so sophisticated cement,
even more sophisticated

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:90%
than we have now.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.180 align:middle line:84%
But in between the third and
fourth course, a leaf blew in,

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:90%
and they were able to carbon--

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.080 align:middle line:84%
you can't carbon-14
stone, but you can

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.540 align:middle line:90%
carbon-14 something organic.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And they dated it
to 38,000 years ago.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.200 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:10.620 align:middle line:90%
That period.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And they're
showing up all over.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And so, if you go to El Dorado,
all these places, fly over it,

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.680 align:middle line:90%
it looks like jungle.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:21.070 align:middle line:84%
But there's little places where
the stone's showing through.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.240 align:middle line:90%
And that there's cavities.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:90%
And you can go in.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So these pyramids are being
found all over the world.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed
Dr. Sam, and he's

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:34.419 align:middle line:84%
counting up to 80,000
pyramids in the world now.

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That we know of?

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.720 align:middle line:90%
200 and some in China.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.670 align:middle line:84%
45 of which I've
plotted on Google Earth.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:44.970 align:middle line:90%
They're visible.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
that consciousness.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Canary Islands, all over the
place, all over the world.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they were built
thousands and thousands

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:54.250 align:middle line:90%
of years ago.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, at
least prediluvial.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So this business that the
Great Pyramid is 2450 BC

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.455 align:middle line:90%
is nonsense, complete nonsense.

00:33:00.455 --> 00:33:02.210 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't hold up anywhere.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of why we
can't understand the technology

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:84%
because in that time frame, they
didn't have that technology.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.801 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's got
to be a tie in though.

00:33:08.801 --> 00:33:10.324 align:middle line:90%
Somehow, they're all connected.

00:33:10.324 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: I think they are.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.573 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing is that
there's different pyramids.

00:33:13.573 --> 00:33:15.437 align:middle line:90%
And pyramids being built now.

00:33:15.437 --> 00:33:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many
pyramids, new pyramids,

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:84%
have been built in India in
the last couple of years?

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Last couple of years?

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: 20,000.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 20,000 pyramids?

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yep.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:90%
They're building them for--

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.316 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Over the
last, what, 10 years?

00:33:31.316 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing it for?

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.356 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, I spoke
at the Global Pyramid

00:33:34.356 --> 00:33:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Conference in Chicago last May.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
gentleman there that

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.870 align:middle line:84%
had just-- he ran, the
whole time he was talking,

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:84%
he was running
pictures of pyramids.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids on houseboat, pyramids
this, big ones, small ones,

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.240 align:middle line:90%
they're housing people.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.198 align:middle line:90%
They're feeding people.

00:33:47.198 --> 00:33:48.997 align:middle line:90%
They're meditating in them.

00:33:48.997 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're using the
pyramid energy, simply

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:51.470 align:middle line:90%
with the structure.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.428 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pyramid power.

00:33:52.428 --> 00:33:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Pyramid power.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.750 align:middle line:90%
And they're everywhere.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a friend in
school, grade school, who would

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:03.270 align:middle line:90%
wear a pyramid hat to school.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And the kid got all A's.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.389 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that had
anything to do with it or not.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:12.940 align:middle line:84%
But he said his father
said pyramids have energy.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And he would have
a triangular hat.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.480 align:middle line:84%
He'd look like Tom Terrific,
that cartoon character,

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.710 align:middle line:90%
and he'd wear it.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, and this guy
doing his lecture actually

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:84%
had a paper pyramid hat with
a little strap on the bottom

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.179 align:middle line:84%
and he gave his whole
lecture wearing it.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.040 align:middle line:84%
But he talked about
just taking a piece

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.630 align:middle line:84%
of fruit, two oranges, one under
the paper pyramid and one out.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.909 align:middle line:84%
And this one would
last three weeks,

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:38.620 align:middle line:84%
this one will be
rotten in a few days.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you explain that?

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And
then Valery Uvarov

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:43.210 align:middle line:84%
before he started building
the new real pyramids,

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.889 align:middle line:84%
he did all kinds of experiments
with the sharpening razor

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:84%
blades and enhancing medication
and vitamins and that sort

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.760 align:middle line:84%
of thing and understanding
pyramid power.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.723 align:middle line:90%
There is a lot to it.

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:53.889 align:middle line:90%
There really is a lot to it.

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And it is simply the shape
that is doing something.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So they can be just
the outline of it

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.690 align:middle line:84%
or they can be made out
of all different things.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.916 align:middle line:84%
Usually being
aligned to the north,

00:35:03.916 --> 00:35:05.290 align:middle line:84%
south, east, west
cardinal points

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.690 align:middle line:84%
makes some kind of
connection to the Earth grid

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:10.302 align:middle line:90%
that helps the energy.

00:35:10.302 --> 00:35:11.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's all connected.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've talked about
20,000 new pyramids in India.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot
going on in Russia.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yeah.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take a look here.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: So this
is just a model,

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.500 align:middle line:90%
because it's not there yet.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But the one big pyramid has
already been constructed.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And they actually used
crushed quartz in a polymer

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.060 align:middle line:90%
to make the casing stones.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And then they've got a
real quartz crystal on top.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And even the
construction workers

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.660 align:middle line:84%
were having spontaneous
healings in it

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.570 align:middle line:84%
while they were building it,
before the capstone went on.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
They actually asked
me to do a study,

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:49.010 align:middle line:84%
if it was possible, with 400,000
schoolchildren in the area.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Is the pyramid being
off in the distance

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:52.900 align:middle line:90%
helping the schoolchildren?

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they started with
one pyramid in the middle.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're making concentric
circles with 4, 4, 4, 4.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So now they're going to have 33
pyramids, the one in the middle

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.480 align:middle line:90%
being the 33rd.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And so in the area
around it, they're

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.590 align:middle line:84%
building all these
buildings that

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:12.940 align:middle line:84%
will help to change the
paradigm for different domains,

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.060 align:middle line:84%
transportation, communication,
health, education.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.650 align:middle line:90%
And they're working too--

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.655 align:middle line:84%
so this is like the
model of the plot

00:36:19.655 --> 00:36:22.030 align:middle line:84%
of land of where all these
different things would happen.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are those roads?

00:36:22.615 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Is that what I'm looking at?

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: They're connectors.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.633 align:middle line:90%
They're connectors between them.

00:36:25.633 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:90%
This is a model.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:84%
This is an animator's
rendition of it.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's quite remarkable.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:35.761 align:middle line:84%
And they call it Project 12,
because there's 12 domains.

00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is Russia.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.843 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: This is Russia.

00:36:37.843 --> 00:36:39.850 align:middle line:84%
In the center of the
land mass of Russia,

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be Tomsk
in the middle of Siberia,

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.540 align:middle line:84%
but they also call
it the new Atlantis.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And the new series
that I'm making

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:51.670 align:middle line:84%
started out when I was
speaking in St. Petersburg.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And Valery approached me
to make his documentary,

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:55.834 align:middle line:90%
the next documentary series.

00:36:55.834 --> 00:36:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And the funding fell through
and I carried on my own

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.050 align:middle line:90%
with his blessing.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sticking with
that title because it's

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis of what we knew in the
past coming into the future,

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and how can those
values help us now?

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think if
you had to picture Atlantis

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:90%
what did it look like?

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.690 align:middle line:90%
What did they wear?

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:16.790 align:middle line:90%
Did they have computers?

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:17.590 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:19.173 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, I
think they probably

00:37:19.173 --> 00:37:21.640 align:middle line:84%
were more like crystalline
computers in themselves.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
the computation

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.639 align:middle line:84%
and what we're doing
with computers,

00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:27.472 align:middle line:84%
if your system was all
switched on in a true way,

00:37:27.472 --> 00:37:28.930 align:middle line:84%
you may not need
that in the same--

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:30.270 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't be the same way.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.870 align:middle line:90%
It would be more telepathic.

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:34.610 align:middle line:84%
But I've really been
curious about this, George.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:90%
What did they eat?

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:90%
What did they wear?

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:37.090 align:middle line:90%
What did the seasons look like?

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:37.960 align:middle line:90%
And that sort of thing.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think they were
really, really healthy.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.640 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
they had so much time

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to develop their abilities
that they would do things

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:46.490 align:middle line:90%
like acrobatics.

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been fascinated with
some rhythmic gymnastics when

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.550 align:middle line:84%
they spin ribbons and
they dance with hula hoops

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.420 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of thing.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And even figure skating.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I was like where
did this come from?

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Who would have invented this?

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.910 align:middle line:90%
What are they emulating?

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it's almost like
when they're spinning--

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.766 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's a symmetry.

00:38:05.766 --> 00:38:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: --they're
spinning energies.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And then when you really
get somebody who's tuned in

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and skating well, it's
almost like they're

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.170 align:middle line:90%
flying on energy somehow.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So I found myself
thinking, well,

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.999 align:middle line:84%
if Atlantis was at
the equator, why

00:38:17.999 --> 00:38:19.540 align:middle line:84%
do I keep thinking
figure skating has

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.790 align:middle line:90%
something to do with Atlantis?

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And one day, just recently,
I was watching figure skating

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:25.940 align:middle line:90%
and I went it was an Ice Age.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bingo.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: They were seafaring.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.570 align:middle line:90%
There's ice everywhere.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
learned how to skate.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: They learned how to
skate or something like that.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw part
of a gala event.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And this woman actually
had a hula hoop

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:84%
that was tied with
ribbons-- you know

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Cirque du Soleil, that sort of
thing, like a big wide band.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So she's flying,
she's skating around.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And then she skates
into the hula hoop.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And she starts to make it spin.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes up and
then it drops her back down,

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:55.210 align:middle line:90%
and she keeps skating.

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that's it.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:00.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like it all seems
to be coming together.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:84%
That even when you look
at Knossos on Crete

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and you see them
doing a handstand

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.870 align:middle line:84%
on the back of a bull, but
it looks like they're just

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.703 align:middle line:84%
about to flip, well
there's all these things

00:39:08.703 --> 00:39:11.850 align:middle line:84%
where they're doing
acrobats with animals,

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.130 align:middle line:90%
telepathy with horses.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's this guy
Frederic Pignon who's

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.270 align:middle line:90%
working with Friesian horses.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.430 align:middle line:90%
And you know he smiles.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:25.110 align:middle line:90%
He uses the whip like a wand.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.550 align:middle line:84%
He is giving communication
to the animals.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.910 align:middle line:90%
No bit, no saddle, no nothing.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:34.140 align:middle line:84%
He gets them to sit down
like a dog, lie in his lap.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And then he'll stand up
one foot on two horses.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like that's
what they were doing.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.967 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
Crete was kind of one

00:39:41.967 --> 00:39:44.425 align:middle line:84%
of the remnants when you think
about the clothes they wore.

00:39:44.425 --> 00:39:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you liked to
have lived then as a witness?

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:47.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, you did.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: I think I did.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You did
in another life.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: I think I did.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do we do
with all this knowledge?

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:55.170 align:middle line:84%
This knowledge that
you give us, that we

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:84%
begin to learn about
Atlantis, about the pyramids.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.940 align:middle line:90%
What does that all mean to us?

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Well,

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: I've been
saying cancel money, cancel

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.464 align:middle line:84%
the government, and
start over for 35 years.

00:40:05.464 --> 00:40:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like they did.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, they weren't
all obsessed with money.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:09.924 align:middle line:90%
They didn't need it.

00:40:09.924 --> 00:40:10.723 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:40:10.723 --> 00:40:11.760 align:middle line:90%
So everything was fair.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.759 align:middle line:90%
Everything was creative.

00:40:12.759 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
Amarna Period in Egypt

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.920 align:middle line:84%
was among the most
recent time where

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.130 align:middle line:84%
we had that kind of
creativity, flattened

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:24.090 align:middle line:90%
hierarchies, beauty, flower.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:27.150 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to go
back to that kind of thing

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:30.350 align:middle line:84%
where if it isn't good for
everyone, it's not good at all.

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Where we're more telepathic,
people are transparent,

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:84%
you can see, we can
see through each other.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So then all this business of
hiding and shadow government

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.907 align:middle line:84%
and all that stuff is just
it's illuminated somehow.

00:40:44.907 --> 00:40:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.472 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: It is fantastic,
because we've lost our way.

00:40:49.472 --> 00:40:51.680 align:middle line:84%

>>NOORY: I've got to tell you.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I've been fascinated
with Atlanta

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.800 align:middle line:84%
since I was a little boy, just
the mysteries surrounding just

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:84%
what was this region, and
what kind of technology

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.200 align:middle line:90%
did they really possess?

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.790 align:middle line:84%
People like Carmen Boulter
give us some of those answers.

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
"Beyond Belief."
