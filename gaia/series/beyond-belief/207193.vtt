00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I was five years old.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.650 align:middle line:90%
I started having experiences.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I would look at someone, and I
would see their consciousness.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:90%
But I could also see beings.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I could see angels
and things like that.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>> At that age?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Remarkable.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a measurable
connection between mind

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.750 align:middle line:90%
and matter.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to understand
the mechanics of it.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:84%
What did my brain have
to do to get there,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
to receive information
that nobody told me

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:90%
about beforehand?

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a force
that's doing it?

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> You are the force.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:84%
What do you need to do
in your consciousness

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:90%
to make something happen?

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is for
everyone to be conscious,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
to be consciously creating,
so that you are not

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:84%
allowing the consciousness
of another to impose--

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Or interfere.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> --or supersede or interfere
with what you're trying

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:90%
to create.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It's remarkable.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:84%
What a tool, if
you can master it.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.473 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.473 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to another edition

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:90%
of Beyond Belief.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:10%
Caroline Cory with us, an
award-winning filmmaker,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:10%
best-selling author,
founder of Omnium Media,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:10%
which is a film and
digital media production

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:10%
company that jumps
in and tackles

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:10%
various
thought-provoking topics.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Caroline, welcome
back to the program.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CAROLINE CORY: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.155 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How are you?

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:37.245 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: I'm awesome.

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What have you
been up to these days?

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: Well, just working
on "Superhuman," getting it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:10%
out there.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.268 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
great film, I hear.

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: It is amazing.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's available
on Gaia now, too, right?

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: It's on Gaia, so
everybody should watch it.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also in pre-production
on my next movie, so--

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't stop.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I don't stop.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:10%
I mean--

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in this field

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to talk about?

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: Well, when
I was younger--

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:10%
I was five years old--

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.260 align:middle line:10%
I started having experiences.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I would look at someone and I
would see their consciousness.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I would see what was
going on for them.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
What would happen to
them the next day.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I would see what's
on the other side of a wall.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it genetic?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.985 align:middle line:84%
Passed down from your
mother or your father?

00:02:27.985 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I don't know.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.693 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe-- I think I
had a grandmother that had--

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This ability?

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: --something
like-- yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:90%
But I could also see beings.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I could see angels
and things like that.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At that age?

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.687 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:02:40.687 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: And so-- but I didn't
think it was anything special.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, all kids do
that, so I didn't really

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:90%
talk about it.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:90%
But it kind of stayed with me.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I kept thinking, how
is that possible?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Is everybody doing this?

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And how does it really work?

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You thought it
was natural, didn't you?

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:90%
And how does it really work?

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Like, I wanted to understand
the mechanics of it.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:84%
What did my brain have
to do to get there,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to receive information
that nobody told me

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:90%
about beforehand?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And so because of
this, I started

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
to get into the field of
consciousness, consciousness

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.580 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:90%
How does the brain work?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Does it trigger
these experiences,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:90%
or is it something else?

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
What is the connection between
consciousness, our mind,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
our intention, and
our physical brain?

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:90%
So 20 years later, you know--

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Working, teaching, lecturing,
writing books, working

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
with hundreds of people,
I realized this is real.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:90%
There is actual science behind.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question about it.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: No question.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
that you get validation.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you see something

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.060 align:middle line:84%
that was going to
happen the next day

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and it does happen, I
mean, that is validation.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:84%
If you see something that the
person is struggling with,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and then they go to the doctor
and it's diagnosed that way,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:90%
that is validation.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep having validation
after validation, at one point,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:90%
you go, OK, I'm not crazy.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
There is something
that we can tap into

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.370 align:middle line:90%
to receive information.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
The mechanics of it we're
still trying to figure out,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:84%
but it is it definite
phenomenon that's very real.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody is doing
that without even knowing.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Caroline, let's
get into mind over matter.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion,
what is mind over matter?

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Well, basically,
it's the ability of focusing

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:84%
your mind on something
physical, matter,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and get it to change according
to what your intention is.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So for example, if my
heart rate is going crazy right

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:84%
now, or I have a headache
or something like that,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:84%
is it possible for your
mind, just through intention,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
to focus on your head, or
your stomach, whatever it is--

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And make that change.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: --and make that change?

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, it's
not just experiential.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:84%
We started working with
scientists in laboratory

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
measuring exactly
that interaction.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.510 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
worked with water.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
We would put a glass of
water and focus on it

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and see if we could
change the pH.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Could it go up?

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Could it go down?

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, like Dr.
Emoto's experiments.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Emoto, but
William Tiller.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: He did a
phenomenal experiment

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:90%
with the pH of water.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And so just for
people to know, when

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:84%
we set up a
scientific experiment,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%
we take what we call a baseline.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So we take measurements
over and over and over

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:90%
for a long period of time.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And then exactly at a certain
point, you focus on the water,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and you see if you can get
the pH to go up or down.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And exactly at that time, you
see the measurement jump up

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:90%
100%, 400%.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
stop looking at it,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.380 align:middle line:90%
it goes back to the baseline.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So that time correlation,
when we repeat it again,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.660 align:middle line:90%
becomes a scientific validation.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So we've done that
over and over.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, there is
a measurable connection

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:90%
between mind and matter.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a powerful
tool, isn't it, Caroline?

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: It's very powerful.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The ability to
do that and change things.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:90%
And people don't realize--

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, already just with
water, we are made of water.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So if we can do this
in a glass of water,

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.520 align:middle line:84%
why couldn't we
do it on our body?

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why a full
moon plays havoc on our brains,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
interconnected, so there's--

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, of course
I've come to the conclusion

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
is fundamental,

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
meaning it is part
of all of life.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
fabric of life itself.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So whether it be a physical
object, a biological system,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:84%
your body, or your
mind, it's just

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:84%
another part of that fabric
of consciousness itself.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Train us a little
bit in mind over matter.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
We've got your
series, "Superhuman"

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:90%
which is now on Gaia--

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and you explain
how you can train people

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.843 align:middle line:90%
with some exercises.

00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY (VOICEOVER): I asked
PK practitioner and meditation

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
teacher Sean McNamara
to facilitate a session

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:84%
with my friend Rachele, who
had never practiced PK before

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:90%
and was eager to try.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Sean, I'm so excited about this.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.043 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned Rachele to you.

00:08:00.043 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>RACHELE BROOKE SMITH: I can't
tell you how excited I am.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I cannot wait to learn.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:10%
>>SEAN MCNAMARA: It sounds like
you have a lot of confidence

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.640 align:middle line:10%
already, like some
part of you already

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.807 align:middle line:10%
believes that it's possible.

00:08:09.807 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:10%
Is that true?

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Oh, I do.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.318 align:middle line:10%
I have been studying
and so passionate

00:08:13.318 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:10%
about the power of thought
and intention, I mean,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.260 align:middle line:10%
ever since I was 14.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
I went through a really
difficult time in my life.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:84%
I saw a movie that
changed my life,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and I had this very
life-changing experience

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
where I was like, that's
what I want to do.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:90%
I want to perform.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I want to act.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to inspire people just
like that film did for me.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Through focusing on that,
intending it, writing it down,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:84%
having vision boards, like,
seeing it, watching every day,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:84%
seeing myself do it
every day, I ended up

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.682 align:middle line:84%
playing the lead in the
sequel to that same film

00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
six years later,
something that everybody

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:90%
told me was impossible.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: Where you place your
awareness is where energy goes.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:84%
That's basically
all we're doing here

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:84%
with this psychokinesis
experiment.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to produce
movement by using

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.010 align:middle line:90%
our mind in a certain way.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.980 align:middle line:10%
And it's really
like baking a cake.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:84%
You put all the right
ingredients together,

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and you put them in the oven,
and you give it enough time.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And when enough
time has passed, you

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.675 align:middle line:84%
pull out this beautiful,
delicious cake.

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: And no
calories involved.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:04.493 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:04.493 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCNAMARA: That's right.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MCNAMARA: It is a
meditation process in itself

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:84%
in the way other
types of meditation

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.970 align:middle line:84%
have those life
lessons wrapped in.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You see it right in
front of your eyes.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're too tense,
it stops moving.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.147 align:middle line:84%
When you relax, it
starts moving again.

00:09:20.147 --> 00:09:22.230 align:middle line:84%
If you don't give it enough
time, it doesn't work.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:90%
If you let go, it works.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is just another way
of showing those basic life

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.633 align:middle line:84%
principles that
we all know about.

00:09:29.633 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And so at this point, we
can lift up your container.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And you'll want to
do this very slowly,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.608 align:middle line:84%
because when you
do it too quickly,

00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
it knocks off the tin
foil from the needle.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.813 align:middle line:10%
And then you'll want to just
put your hands on the glass

00:09:38.813 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:10%
on either side of the object.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, it'll
start responding

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:10%
to your breathing pattern and
to the level of relaxation

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.530 align:middle line:10%
in your mind.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.720 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, when it starts,
it means that the shift

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:10%
has occurred within you.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:10%
And mine just started
responding too,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.555 align:middle line:10%
so I think we're
sharing a field now.

00:10:00.555 --> 00:10:01.583 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Is it working?

00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That is
so cool to watch.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was totally still.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.183 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: It's moving.

00:10:05.183 --> 00:10:08.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: As maybe silly to some
as this may sound, sending love

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:84%
to the material, saying,
like, you know, I love you,

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
like, let's work together
on this, let's be one.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's move together.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.297 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Look what it's doing
as you're talking about love.

00:10:20.297 --> 00:10:22.797 align:middle line:10%
>>MCNAMARA: Your heart's opening
as you're talking about it,

00:10:22.797 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:10%
and it feels it.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.182 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I can
also feel whenever

00:10:25.182 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I start to feel those
ego thoughts, or wanting

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
to get it right, or
afraid of failure,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:90%
then there's this disconnect.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's so
powerful to understand

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
that that's the
whole thing of ego,

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
is like the want to
get it right is--

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:90%
can block you.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:84%
But when you just allow,
in the end be filled

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:84%
with love and energy,
like, amazing,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:90%
miraculous things can happen.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an amazing
experiment, Carol.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that work?

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Well, mind over matter.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Simple as that.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:90%
But honestly, it's really--

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
people don't realize that
everything is interconnected.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:84%
As we were doing
these experiments,

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.880 align:middle line:84%
it was very, very important
to shift your perception,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
your perspective,
that I am separate

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.990 align:middle line:84%
from this physical object,
and I want to make it move.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work this way.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.728 align:middle line:90%
You can try as hard as you want.

00:11:23.728 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work this way.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:25.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It won't happen.

00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:25.825 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:11:25.825 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:84%
But the minute-- that's why we
talked about how she started

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
talking to it as if it was part
of her and talking about love,

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:90%
it was amazing.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:84%
The minute she started
to think and feel

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
that this object was kind
of an extension of her,

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and she was just
projecting love,

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.870 align:middle line:84%
the thing responded
instantaneously.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
force that's doing it?

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: You are the force.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.667 align:middle line:90%
And so of course, some people--

00:11:55.667 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like an invisible
hand is in there,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:90%
moving it around, or what?

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So you can do it in
many different ways.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:90%
You can imagine.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, we helped
Rachele, because she had never

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.130 align:middle line:90%
done it before.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
So we would tell
her, just imagine

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.130 align:middle line:84%
that where you think
your hand is ending

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and this piece of
paper is there,

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
imagine that your hand
is extending into--

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Into the paper.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: --the paper.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, so as you are
moving, or as you're

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:84%
thinking that you're moving,
the paper can start to rotate.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
Mr. McNamara who was there

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.810 align:middle line:90%
conducting the experiment.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So in the movie,
I wanted to bring

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:90%
different people who did this.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to,
like, be the only one

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.305 align:middle line:90%
to show that many people are--

00:12:40.305 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can do this.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Can do this
and are doing this.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle line:90%
And so I asked Sean.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle line:84%
He's been doing
telekinesis for a while.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why don't you come
and facilitate that session

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
so that people can
see it on camera?

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
we're filming here.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not so easy.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:90%
You have electromagnetic.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:84%
You have camera equipment, audio
cables, people looking at you,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:90%
wanting you to succeed.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to succeed?

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is all
energy and information

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of interfering
with what you're trying to do.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So you really have to know
how to focus and shift

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:84%
that perception to that
point of really believing

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that that object is
not separate from you.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you
use mind over matter

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:90%
in your day-to-day life?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you don't want to use
it just to make little aluminum

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:90%
foil spin around.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:90%
How would you apply it?

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the
piece of paper.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
But as you are
doing this work, you

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand
so much about you,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:84%
about what do you need to
do in your consciousness

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:90%
to make something happen?

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the idea.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So of course here, it's just
a small segment of the film.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And we saw that the piece
of paper was right there.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But then, at one point, we
did the exact same experiment

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
in a Faraday cage, meaning
completely isolated.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Isolated.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can get to it.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Nothing can get
to it, and at a distance.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So now, we were able to
prove and demonstrate

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that your consciousness is
non-local, even at a distance.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I was in Los Angeles and
the scientist was in Oregon,

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.337 align:middle line:84%
and we were able to
do the exact same--

00:14:32.337 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you see
these experiments,

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:84%
you start to kind of feel
more empowered that, wait,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:84%
if I did that to
the piece of paper

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.630 align:middle line:84%
not just sitting in front of
me but 1,000 miles away, it

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.790 align:middle line:90%
means my mind can do something.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So let me see today,
how am I feeling?

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
I want to create?

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
We talked about not feeling
well physically, for example.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Why not just use your mind?

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.300 align:middle line:84%
We are so programmed
when something is not

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:90%
feeling quite right.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:84%
We are programmed to
think, uh-oh, what's wrong?

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Am I getting sick?

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:90%
What should I do?

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:90%
What do I need to take?

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're conditioning
ourself for that.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So the way we can use
this in our daily life

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:23.570 align:middle line:84%
is to begin to introduce
it in our daily life

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:84%
through every little
thing that we do.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.090 align:middle line:84%
We're not feeling
well physically.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.190 align:middle line:90%
We want to create something.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, I had
a fun experience

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.717 align:middle line:90%
coming here with Tom, your Tom.

00:15:34.717 --> 00:15:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My producer, Tom.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.715 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:15:36.715 --> 00:15:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it may sound,
you know, out there.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.007 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
he do this time?

00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It may sound, like, totally
out there to a lot of people,

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:84%
but honestly, if you
start doing this thing,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:84%
you will realize that
there is a correlation.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So it was a snowstorm
non-stop two days.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:90%
We were--

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We didn't
think we'd get here.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:55.968 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:15:55.968 --> 00:15:57.885 align:middle line:84%
And also, I have to get
out of here, you know,

00:15:57.885 --> 00:15:59.590 align:middle line:90%
when we're done.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:90%
So we focused.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
I said, that's it.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I need to get in there.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:90%
You need to come here.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:84%
We need to get this done
and do the work on schedule.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.563 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, it went
from 100% to 60% to 40%.

00:16:15.563 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not even snowing.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:90%
It's sunny out now.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's nice out.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I know.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.777 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And getting warmer.

00:16:19.777 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I know.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And so people would say,
wait, OK, it's a coincidence.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, but next time
you're in a parking lot,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.560 align:middle line:84%
you're carrying all
these groceries,

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's pouring rain, and
you've got to walk to your car,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you don't
have an umbrella.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.358 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: You don't
have an umbrella.

00:16:36.358 --> 00:16:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, um, can I make
the rain stop for just a minute

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:90%
just so I can get in the car?

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.058 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:16:44.058 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've tried that.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: And?

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it does work.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: It does work.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: So that's the thing.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So when you take an isolated
example, people would say,

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's a coincidence,
you know, dismiss it.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:84%
But when you do it
over and over and over,

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.140 align:middle line:84%
you start to feel that
you're not separate.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not separate from the
planet, from the weather,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:90%
from others.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And so you use your
consciousness to your benefit;

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
to make you feel good,
to create what you want.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:90%
That's how we can use it.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at a clip
from your film "Superhuman"

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:90%
on mind over matter.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: The idea is
then to try to influence

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:10%
this piece of paper
that's totally isolated

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:10%
and get it to rotate.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.857 align:middle line:84%
>> To rotate without any effect
from any known physical forces.

00:17:35.857 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: You explained to me that
it's actually quite difficult

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.770 align:middle line:84%
to do it with a
vacuum, so there's--

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>> So actually, it's impossible.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So not just difficult,
which is why

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I've added a little twist,
which actually allows me

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish this in a vacuum.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Something very similar to
this is inside the container.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm
doing is I'm adding

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
random mechanical fluctuations
or perturbations to the target.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.140 align:middle line:84%
By controlling the
amplitude of the signal that

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:84%
gets to the speaker,
we can control

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
the amplitude and how
much motion is actually

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:90%
induced in the target.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But typically, it's probably
less than a millimeter.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't cause any large
scale ordered rotation,

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
but rather just this very small
oscillation of the target.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.290 align:middle line:84%
The standard protocol for doing
a proper experimental design

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:84%
is you obtain a
baseline period, just

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:84%
establishing that
there is no motion,

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
environmental effect.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So what you're
saying, when we are creating

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:84%
the baseline over several
hours, this very small linear

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.420 align:middle line:84%
oscillation is
taken into account--

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.573 align:middle line:90%
>> And will be visible.

00:18:56.573 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: And will be visible.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:10%
So we know that by the time
you're influencing the target,

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:10%
we see a big difference.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And we see the
rotation that is coming

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:84%
from the consciousness
or the intent

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to from
the little speaker.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.868 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let
you try it yourself.

00:19:13.868 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going leave you some space.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.915 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: So, Mike, how did it go?

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can see,
here's the baseline,

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and it shows that the target is
randomly moving back and forth,

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.470 align:middle line:84%
maybe like a degree or
so from peak to peak.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, at this point here,
you see a larger rotation.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
I am willing with my mind

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and saying, you know, move
or do this like a command,

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
but rather it's much more of
a feeling of connectedness.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's truly
fascinating, isn't it?

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:84%
It makes you wonder
what else can you

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:90%
do with mind over matter?

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Physically, like
you said, make it

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:84%
stop raining for a little bit
so you can rush to your car.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds of
applications, aren't there?

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:10%
And I think the idea is
some people say, well, wait,

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:10%
are you interfering
with the collective?

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.915 align:middle line:10%
Or are you doing
something that you're not

00:20:39.915 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:10%
supposed to be doing?

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.560 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the Earth wants to rain.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, you know--
or for example,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:84%
focusing on a hurricane or
something, an earthquake

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:84%
or something, that is
about to have-- of course,

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:84%
we feel earthquakes, but
that hasn't been proven yet

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.650 align:middle line:90%
how that's possible.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But the point being, when you
project your consciousness

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and you want
something to change,

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:84%
are you interfering with
the bigger or larger order

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.630 align:middle line:90%
of things?

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does negativity
influence mind over matter

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:90%
and make it not work?

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Make it not work?

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:84%
However, I truly believe
that positive thinking

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:90%
is the dominant force.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Because--

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Because you're working
with the universal forces

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.420 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:10%
The universe is
programmed to want

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.930 align:middle line:10%
to thrive, to evolve, to
create, not to self-destruct.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that is a positive
evolutionary pattern

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:84%
that you're working with when
you have positive thoughts.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And so if somebody's
trying to stop you,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of based on
separation, on control,

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.995 align:middle line:84%
and that's the reason why I
don't think it would work.

00:21:58.995 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going
to give you example,

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and you tell me what
you think happened here.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: OK.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll cite my
producer Tom again.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
He and I were at an event
in Laughlin, Nevada,

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.972 align:middle line:84%
and when it was over, Tom said,
hey, what do you want to do?

00:22:11.972 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Where do you want
to go for dinner?

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to this little casino.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a few drinks.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's have some fun.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.538 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're done.

00:22:18.538 --> 00:22:19.580 align:middle line:90%
We're done for the night.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Sure, let's do it.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So we go, and we decide to
sit at a blackjack table, OK?

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a different
kind of blackjack table.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:84%
It's got a wheel that
if you get a blackjack

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and you've put a dollar
in this little circle,

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:90%
you get to spin the wheel.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And you get whatever it clicks
to, up to $1,000, some of it

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:90%
nothing, but it's on this wheel.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:46.357 align:middle line:90%
So we're playing that.

00:22:46.357 --> 00:22:47.440 align:middle line:90%
There's three of us there.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.390 align:middle line:84%
There's me and Tom and
some guy we don't know.

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And the guy we don't know
is sitting between us.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:90%
And I get a blackjack.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And I had a dollar in
this little circle,

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:84%
so I'm allowed to have them spin
this wheel, and we will get--

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
I will get-- whatever
it clicks to.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So Tom said, let's
concentrate on the $1,000.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.102 align:middle line:84%
So the guy spins it,
click, click, click,

00:23:13.102 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
click, click, click,
click, click, click.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
It's coming up to
$100, passes that up.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:90%
$5, passes that up.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:84%
It's coming up to
the $1,000, and it's

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
getting slower, and
slower, and slower.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And Tom says,
George, concentrate.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Concentrate.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:90%
So I am.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:90%
And he is.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:36.170 align:middle line:84%
The guy in the middle goes,
nah, this doesn't work.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It stopped one click
before the $1,000.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.981 align:middle line:90%
I got, like, $2.00.

00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Oh my god.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I contend that
this guy's negativity

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.070 align:middle line:90%
screwed that up.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:90%
What do you say?

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: I understand
it may look that way,

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:84%
but I think what screwed it up
is the fact that it threw you

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.460 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He threw me off?

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.210 align:middle line:90%
So you were sending--

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Positive.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Positive,
positive, positive.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.776 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tom was
sending positive.

00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:06.776 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: But the second--

00:24:06.776 --> 00:24:09.680 align:middle line:84%
the second he said that, you
kind of dropped that focus.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, but wasn't
he also sending negativity?

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: For sure.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So who's to say the
negativity didn't pull it down?

00:24:17.175 --> 00:24:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I don't know.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:23.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to think it's really just
the positive thinking that you

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.640 align:middle line:90%
kind of lost right there.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of many
Gaia documentaries

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
is called "Down the Quantum
Rabbit Hole" and Dr. Joe

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Dispenza talks about
mind over matter

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:90%
and how it can heal the body.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE DISPENZA: I like
the placebo effect,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.580 align:middle line:84%
because it has to do with
a person's acceptance.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.020 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it's about.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, they
took this group

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
of people that had
Parkinson's disease.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:10%
And in Parkinson's
disease, there's

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:10%
a problem in the brain
with making dopamine.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a little nuclei
called the substantia nigra

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:90%
that stops making dopamine.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when
there's no dopamine,

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:84%
the body starts to
respond differently.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:10%
We have musculoskeletal
problems.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.520 align:middle line:10%
We have tremors, what's
called intention tremors.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have foot shuffling,
or we have pill rolling.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.430 align:middle line:10%
And these are muscular
actions that supersede

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:10%
our voluntary control.

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:10%
We can't control those.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:10%
So they took a group of people
that had Parkinson's disease,

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:10%
and they said to them, now
listen, we have this injection.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.510 align:middle line:10%
It's going to make you better.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:10%
Well, 50% of the people that got
the injection all of a sudden

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:10%
lost all their
motor dysfunction.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:10%
In other words, they
weren't pill rolling,

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:10%
they weren't shuffling
their feet anymore,

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:10%
they didn't have intention
tremors, tremors when

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.232 align:middle line:10%
they were grabbing for objects.

00:25:38.232 --> 00:25:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So the doctor said,
well, you know,

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
that's a great
example of a placebo.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's all in your mind.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:84%
But when they checked
the dopamine levels that

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.210 align:middle line:84%
were produced in the brain, the
interesting thing that happened

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:84%
was that the brain started
making dopamine because they

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:90%
accepted that they were well.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words, their thought
that they were well allowed

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.070 align:middle line:90%
them to begin to be well.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you're being well
in the quantum field,

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.030 align:middle line:84%
the observer has to
supply the chemistry

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.435 align:middle line:90%
to match who you're being.

00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've used
this, haven't you?

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: That's exactly right.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that
it's your consciousness.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It is your intention
that directs

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.370 align:middle line:90%
what you want to see happen.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.000 align:middle line:84%
But then your brain
responds to that command

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and triggers whatever
physiological change

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.720 align:middle line:84%
it needs to make
that change happen.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So that is the interaction
between consciousness

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.310 align:middle line:90%
and the physical brain.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it makes
it happen, doesn't it?

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
tremendous abilities.

00:26:41.708 --> 00:26:43.700 align:middle line:90%
How have you used it in healing?

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: All the time.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.130 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, this
morning I had a bit

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.830 align:middle line:84%
of a little canker
sore thing starting.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I was, like, oh, this is a sign
usually of acidic environment

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:90%
in the stomach.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So instead of going, oh, I've
got to go to the pharmacy,

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:90%
or why?

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Or how come?

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Or-- it doesn't matter.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Try not to go there.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So I just quickly focused on
actually bringing some light

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:84%
around it, but more
importantly, changing

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:84%
the environment, the
acidic environment

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:90%
in my digestive system.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Within seconds, it
was completely gone.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It happens that fast?

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And you know how
painful that is.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: So, you know,
I'm not going there.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how I
use it all the time.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.200 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.650 align:middle line:84%
When I'm also with people,
when we're filming, or--

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter-- with friends
they start having a headache.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So I try to encourage
them right there,

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.950 align:middle line:84%
just focus on the
headache being gone.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And I help them just
flow the energy better,

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and the headache is
gone within seconds.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the focus
like meditation?

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it one and the same?

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.063 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: But it's also condensed.

00:27:57.063 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Like what Dr.
Dispenza was saying,

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:90%
it has to do with belief.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:04.820 align:middle line:84%
When you do it over and over,
you really get the validation

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and you start to believe, this
time when I'm going to say it,

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.930 align:middle line:90%
it is going to happen.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.490 align:middle line:90%
So you get better at it.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.800 align:middle line:84%
You just have to kind
of keep going there

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and train yourself, program
yourself that it is possible.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Do it a few times,
then that's it.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.840 align:middle line:90%
It becomes an automatic thing.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
any limit to what you

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.868 align:middle line:90%
can do with mind over matter?

00:28:24.868 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: I don't think so.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- but another
thing I want to say,

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about that could
be very relatable to people.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:84%
People say, OK, well, can you
use it for, like, chemtrails?

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Or things that are being--

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:90%
5G.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Where we're being
bombarded with things

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.350 align:middle line:84%
that are very, very powerful,
not just a stomachache

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, we've tried it.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:84%
I tried it, because I really
feel that when the chemtrails,

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.792 align:middle line:90%
those chemicals come through--

00:28:54.792 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tumbling down on us.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So this one time, I
was with a friend,

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and we started to
see those things.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.420 align:middle line:90%
You know how they are.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're up there.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, I mean, it's so,
so clear up in the sky.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They look
like vapor, but--

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so I said, you know,
I don't know what this is,

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.390 align:middle line:84%
but every time, it
really messes me up.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's see if we can
use all of this work

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that we've been doing
together and get it to stop.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really know
how it's being done.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the
pilot, is he like pressing

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:84%
on some sort of
button or something?

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.753 align:middle line:84%
Does he even know
it's happening?

00:29:31.753 --> 00:29:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah,
the pilot knows.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So but I-- in other
words, I don't

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:84%
know what I want to interfere
with, when I want to.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:44.620 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that I don't
want to be affected negatively

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.420 align:middle line:90%
by this thing.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So focusing on
this intention, we

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.770 align:middle line:84%
are both looking at
this thing and thinking

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:55.380 align:middle line:84%
whatever's being dumped on
me, I don't want to absorb it.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to absorb it.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.735 align:middle line:84%
And so we literally
see that thing.

00:30:00.735 --> 00:30:01.610 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
clear in the sky.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.883 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: And it literally
stops right in the middle.

00:30:06.883 --> 00:30:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Because usually,
it kind of like--

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It dissipates.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:84%
It usually kind of,
like, gradually gets

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:84%
smaller and smaller,
and then it dissipates.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.910 align:middle line:90%
It was like a boom.

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You cut
it off right there.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
did we just do that?

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.040 align:middle line:90%
And then we did it again.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:90%
And we did it another time.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And it does work.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So you start to wonder, it's not
just about those little things.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:90%
You know, your stomach--

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.790 align:middle line:84%
which is not that
little, but still--

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:84%
like, it's not just
your physical body.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:40.100 align:middle line:84%
But even things that we
think we have no control

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.010 align:middle line:90%
over; the vaccines, maybe.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.620 align:middle line:90%
The 5G, maybe.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The power of
the mind, isn't it?

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Absolutely.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
documentary, of course,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.972 align:middle line:84%
that we just mentioned, "Down
the Rabbit Hole" on Gaia,

00:30:54.972 --> 00:30:59.150 align:middle line:84%
but this time Professor William
Tiller talked about intention

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:90%
and how you can use it.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.580 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM TILLER: We took two
simple black boxes like this.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.950 align:middle line:10%
Inside is a very
simple electric circuit

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:10%
with a few diodes,
oscillator, EPROM,

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.010 align:middle line:10%
some resistors and capacitors.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.110 align:middle line:10%
Basically that's it.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:10%
We wrap one in aluminum foil.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:10%
We put it in an electrically
grounded Faraday cage.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.600 align:middle line:10%
The other, we set on a
tabletop around which

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:10%
four very well-qualified
meditators, highly inner self

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:10%
managed individuals, sit.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:10%
And they go into a
deep meditative state.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:10%
They cleanse the environment.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:10%
They make it essentially
a sacred space

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:10%
using their mind,
cleansing procedures,

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.490 align:middle line:10%
and their intentions.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.730 align:middle line:10%
And then, one of the four
speaks the specific intention

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.050 align:middle line:10%
for this device.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:53.180 align:middle line:10%
The intention is to influence
a particular target experiment.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:10%
It might be to increase
the pH of purified water

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:02.020 align:middle line:10%
by one full pH unit or to
decrease the pH by one full pH

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:02.820 align:middle line:10%
unit.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.670 align:middle line:10%
We've used these devices
on all those experiments,

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:07.620 align:middle line:10%
and have been
robustly successful.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.530 align:middle line:10%
In the meditative
process, then after one

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.920 align:middle line:10%
speaks the particular
intention, it's

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.900 align:middle line:10%
held various ways by the
four for maybe 15 minutes,

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.640 align:middle line:10%
and then, so be it.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.780 align:middle line:10%
It's let go.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.540 align:middle line:10%
And then a subsidiary
intention is

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:10%
stated to seal that
imprint into the device.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:33.780 align:middle line:10%
We take one of these devices
with this aluminum foil.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.520 align:middle line:10%
We put it in a soft package.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.200 align:middle line:10%
We put it in a FedEx packet.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:10%
We ship it 2,000 miles
away to the laboratory

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.930 align:middle line:10%
we were using up in Minnesota.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.820 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as it
arrives there, it

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:10%
goes into its own electrically
grounded Faraday cage.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:51.150 align:middle line:10%
The next day, we do the
same with the control.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:53.550 align:middle line:10%
The experiment is
running, and basically

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:55.920 align:middle line:10%
then, one just takes
the device out, sets it

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.530 align:middle line:10%
beside the experiment
within 6 inches to a foot,

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:10%
and turns it on for
a period of time.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:10%
That's it.

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:06.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, we learned over
some period of time

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.380 align:middle line:10%
that there was another factor.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.220 align:middle line:10%
We found that the use of these--

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:10%
we call them intention
imprinted electrical devices--

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:19.560 align:middle line:10%
the continued use of
this somehow conditions

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.220 align:middle line:10%
the space to some higher
level of symmetry.

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.580 align:middle line:10%
And we start getting
new phenomena.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:10%
That is, the devices work.

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.990 align:middle line:10%
That is, the pH,
which is normal,

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:35.100 align:middle line:10%
starts rising one full pH
unit, if that was the imprint,

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:10%
or starts dropping.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:10%
In a living system, you
go plus or minus half a pH

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.590 align:middle line:10%
unit in either direction,
you're dead on both ends.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:47.080 align:middle line:10%
So these are very big effects.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.040 align:middle line:10%
So for example, in
terms of healing,

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.040 align:middle line:10%
one of the things that we
ultimately expect to do

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.620 align:middle line:10%
is to be able to
broadcast this so

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.560 align:middle line:10%
that we create an
environment where people are

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.730 align:middle line:10%
500 or 1,000 miles away, or
10,000 miles away, wherein

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:06.880 align:middle line:10%
they can use their intention
to enhance their health.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.409 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A professor
who obviously

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:09.379 align:middle line:90%
believes in intention.

00:34:09.379 --> 00:34:10.179 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Absolutely.

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It works.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: I mean, these scientists
are doing it correctly,

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:16.120 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.949 align:middle line:90%
Rigorous, scientific.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:19.449 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I like
the fact they're

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:20.960 align:middle line:90%
getting involved in this, too.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.530 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer this
woo-woo thing out there.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:27.730 align:middle line:90%
It's measurable.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:29.540 align:middle line:90%
It's repeatable.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So now, this becomes
a serious science.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
understand how it happens.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:90%
They just know what's happening.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.808 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what we're still

00:34:39.808 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure
out, why it happens,

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:47.770 align:middle line:84%
because the problem
with other types,

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.050 align:middle line:84%
or mainstream science
doing experiments

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.340 align:middle line:90%
is that every single time--

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.340 align:middle line:84%
you know, you have 2 plus
2, you're always going

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.620 align:middle line:90%
to get 4 no matter what you do.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.950 align:middle line:90%
That's mainstream science.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But in this type of
science, one day,

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be able to
raise the pH 1 full decimal.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.040 align:middle line:84%
The next day,
maybe two decimals.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the third day,
maybe half a decimal.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So even though you are
producing a measurable result,

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.140 align:middle line:84%
because the result is not
always exactly the same,

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I think current science, or the
mainstream science, would say,

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.140 align:middle line:90%
let's dismiss it.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.480 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean anything.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But wait, it shouldn't have
had any effect at all, you see.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's what
we're trying to figure out.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that we do
have a measurable effect,

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.370 align:middle line:84%
but that that effect,
I want to call--

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.040 align:middle line:90%
I want to say it's subjective.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It's subjective.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think we can
change the mindset of a person

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:90%
through intention?

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Of course.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just By concentrating--

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: We do that all the time.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --on them
and stuff like that?

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:47.935 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: You concentrate.

00:35:47.935 --> 00:35:49.185 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they come around.

00:35:49.185 --> 00:35:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: I concentrate
on the boyfriend.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.680 align:middle line:90%
He gets up and does the laundry.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He didn't want
to, but you made him do it.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Of course
we're joking around.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:84%
No, but seriously,
I mean you do--

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.420 align:middle line:84%
we are influenced by
people all the time.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if someone
has a strong energy

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and wants to dominate the
space that you're in--

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.900 align:middle line:90%
hopefully it's for the better--

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:90%
then you do feel that energy.

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is for
everyone to be conscious,

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.260 align:middle line:84%
to be consciously creating
so that you're not

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.633 align:middle line:84%
allowing the consciousness
of another to impose--

00:36:29.633 --> 00:36:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or interfere.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Or supersede,
or interfere with what

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.080 align:middle line:90%
you're trying to create.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's remarkable.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.660 align:middle line:90%
What a tool.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:41.290 align:middle line:84%
If you can master it and
use it the right way,

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:43.460 align:middle line:84%
you can do all kinds
of things with this.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I'm teaching
a class and I feel chaos,

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.240 align:middle line:90%
you know, and people are--

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.820 align:middle line:90%
they come from different places.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.470 align:middle line:90%
They just arrived.

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:54.970 align:middle line:90%
The energy is very chaotic.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:56.350 align:middle line:90%
People are frustrated.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Things are kind of all--
and I want people to focus,

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.360 align:middle line:84%
so I start to project the
energy of calm, of focus,

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.265 align:middle line:84%
of connection,
connection with source.

00:37:06.265 --> 00:37:08.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, bring
that sort of energy.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And without even
doing anything, people

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.480 align:middle line:84%
start to just kind of
be at ease and relax.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It works.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Exactly.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's your
next project, Caroline?

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: It's actually-- we're
still in pre-production.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:90%
It's on UFOs.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's the science behind it.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your
theory is they do exist?

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: 100%.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.070 align:middle line:90%
I've seen them.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, having said
that, there's also,

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe, human
technology out there.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little
bit of a mixed bag,

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
what's so confusing.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
they're saying now

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that there's something flying
around our destroyers, our USS

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Navy destroyers.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
But today, I saw
a theory that said

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.970 align:middle line:84%
they could be Russian or
Chinese supersonic drones.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:59.033 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:37:59.033 --> 00:37:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.860 align:middle line:84%
I think some of them are
drones, and some of them

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:84%
are our technology, but there's
certain things we've seen.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.637 align:middle line:90%
I've seen them above my house.

00:38:09.637 --> 00:38:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For people who want to
watch the series "Superhumans"

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.670 align:middle line:90%
they can go to gaia.com.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Absolutely.

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sign up and watch it?

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CORY: Yes, absolutely.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.880 align:middle line:84%
"Superhuman: The
Invisible Made Visible".

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're happy with
that, the documentary series?

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.640 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: I'm very happy,
because up until now, many--

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.190 align:middle line:10%
as you can see, many
people have been talking

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.770 align:middle line:10%
about mind over matter,
our mind creates,

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:31.360 align:middle line:10%
our consciousness creates.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:84%
But I feel this film
is the first time where

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:40.007 align:middle line:84%
we get to see on camera
these experiments being done.

00:38:40.007 --> 00:38:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:45.040 align:middle line:10%
>>CORY: And also, showing
how a scientific experiment

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.600 align:middle line:10%
is being set up right
there on camera.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.130 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's very powerful.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:51.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it hasn't
been done before.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why
I'm very, very optimistic.

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Plus, as you know, we
bring other examples

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:84%
of children and people
reading blindfolded,

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.550 align:middle line:90%
seeing behind their back.

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all this
scientifically demonstrated,

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I think it's never
been done before.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Caroline, Thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief".

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CORY: Thanks so
much for having me.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:90%
This was awesome.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I've always been a
believer in mind over matter,

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.910 align:middle line:10%
but after watching
some of these clips

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:20.660 align:middle line:10%
and some of these examples,
now I'm totally convinced.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:24.170 align:middle line:84%
We can change the outcome
with just our thoughts.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief".

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:32.000 align:middle line:90%
