00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:25.429 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
our special guest today

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:10%
is Jim Self.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Jim is an international
teacher, speaker, author.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.500 align:middle line:84%
He's been teaching healing and
clairvoyance of personal energy

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:90%
since 1980.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:84%
He is a former advisor to the
former President Jimmy Carter

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and also the co-author
of an interactive book

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:84%
called "A Course In
Mastering Alchemy."

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program, Jim.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:90%
It's good to have you.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM SELF: George, my
pleasure to be with you.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We have heard so
much about you and what

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.740 align:middle line:10%
you've done for individuals.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely remarkable.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:90%
How did you get into this field?

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here's a former
advisor to a president.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:84%
How are you doing
these spiritual things

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.319 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, and
self help things?

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:10%
>>SELF: You know, the spiritual
thing has been my life.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I kind of came into the body
with this whole purpose.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And then like everybody,
you pass through a journey.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And you have ups and downs
and interesting little side

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:90%
events that happen.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
The political
aspect was something

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:84%
that was a passion
in terms of, how

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:84%
do you help people live their
lives in a comfortable manner?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And to a great extent, the
whole political process

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
was a disappointment,
because the system

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:90%
doesn't support people.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:90%
The system is about the system.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And so you're watching that
whole process very much

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.327 align:middle line:84%
begin to unravel today in
this shifting transition

00:01:41.327 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
that we're finding
ourselves in spiritually.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you noticing
that people generally

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
are trying desperately to better
themselves in this environment?

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.459 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
you're watching

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
is up until now, the average
person walking on the street

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.035 align:middle line:84%
has been unconscious
of being unconscious.

00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:90%
They just live their lives.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
They just move around
in their lives.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
like little robots.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: To a great extent.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.809 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
is because-- have

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:84%
you ever played a
game and you didn't

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.189 align:middle line:90%
know the rules to the game?

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And I don't like that.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: No.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't like
playing games like that.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.616 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, neither
does the average person.

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
it, they're kind of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:84%
stuck in the money game and the
employment game and the family

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:90%
game.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:84%
But as this shift
of consciousness

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
is now unfolding,
what you're finding

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
is you can no longer
play in that game.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
That game is coming to an end,
that third dimensional game

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.280 align:middle line:84%
of domination, greed,
imposition, competition,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:90%
advantage.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.310 align:middle line:84%
That positioning me
better than you experience

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
is what's really kept
the common person

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.460 align:middle line:90%
in a state of unconsciousness.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost as if
he's had his thumb put on him.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Very much.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:90%
But there's a reason for that.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:84%
This whole, on a
spiritual level,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
there was once a period
of time where there was

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:90%
the fall of consciousness came.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Just keep that real simple.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:84%
In that process, there began
to be splintering of concepts.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
In the realm of
consciousness we play in,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
it's a realm of
form and density.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a wonderful game.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
went from nonphysical

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:90%
into a physical state.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But as it began to get more
dense as part of the process,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.130 align:middle line:84%
there began to be splinters
and fractures in the system.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And the game fractured
at one point to the place

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%
where something more
significant had to be created.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And that creation was
a very rigid structure

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
so that everything
didn't go extinct

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:90%
in a manner of speaking.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, people
have been really suspended

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.970 align:middle line:84%
in an unconscious
space for a long time.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Lots of aspects of
your spiritual ability

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
have really been
separated from you.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Mental, emotional body was
meant to be one body, not two.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And this whole process of
how you play in dimensions.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know the
rules, you don't end up

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.935 align:middle line:84%
in a pretty good
space, and that's

00:04:03.935 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
kind of where
we're playing today

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:84%
is unraveling from
that unconsciousness.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Jim,
this change that you

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:84%
are sensing with people,
the shift, let's say,

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.769 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness, what
has been fueling that?

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Why is it happening now?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, it's
a spiritual shift.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, you're going
from a state of that domination

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:84%
unconsciousness to a
state of well being.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:84%
But what you're
seeing happening is

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing everybody
begin to wake up.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And in one aspect
of that waking up,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:84%
people don't like
what they're seeing.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.534 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
level of frustration

00:04:41.534 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
that's beginning to
come to the surface.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I see it in
road rage incidents.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.417 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: In lots
of ways, exactly.

00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:84%
There's maybe two
sides of it, though.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
There is one side of it
where everybody is waking up

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
into more fear.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I have
my status quo, I

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
have my income I
have my fixed place,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'm uncomfortable
because it's

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:84%
like shifting sands
underneath them.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they're digging
in their heels.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole other
aspect of people

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
that are beginning to wake
up and recognize what I've

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:90%
been experiencing is not OK.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:90%
For example, the MeToo movement.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:84%
They have just been--
people have been suppressed

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:84%
in situations where they've had
to take that state of being.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That situation.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And now
it's like, no more.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you're seeing it
with Black Lives Matter.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing it with
people all over the world.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.122 align:middle line:84%
They're waking up
and they're saying,

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:90%
this is no longer acceptable.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much, Jim, has
social media contributed

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:84%
to the explosion of
things like that?

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Significant.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
It's all of a sudden
there's people finding out

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:84%
there's other people like me
and people who think like me.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they share it.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.163 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: And they share it.

00:05:46.163 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Social media is a
plus and a minus.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:90%
It's got negative consequences.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
All of the fake news
type of concept,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
the misinformation
that's out there.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But you're shifting from a
place where you are waking up.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the key
pieces to it is

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
you can't take your baggage
with you on this journey.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's the piece that I'm
most interested in talking

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:90%
to people about.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.374 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If social media were
gone, it's just all gone.

00:06:11.374 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: People would
still be waking up.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They would?

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: They'd
still be waking up.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.592 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not at the same pace.

00:06:15.592 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Oh, I think so.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.571 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: I think the
pace of waking up

00:06:18.571 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:90%
is not the pace of social media.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:84%
The challenge with
social media is--

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:90%
let me step back a little bit.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:84%
In the game that we play, we are
taught that what they think out

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.160 align:middle line:84%
there is how I live my life
in terms of OK or not OK.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So if I position myself
well, you will like me.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And so to a great
extent, our nature is,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:90%
will they approve of me?

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Am I OK by the
whoever the they are?

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
But what's starting
to happen is people

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.930 align:middle line:84%
are starting to
wake up and begin

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:90%
to have a sense of themselves.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So people are
beginning to want more.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.180 align:middle line:84%
The challenge with social media
is it's a very hollow space.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.990 align:middle line:90%
To a great extent--

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.073 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Extremely hollow.

00:07:02.073 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: The person is
not being validated.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:84%
The person is going
to the outside world

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:90%
and saying, look at me.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.595 align:middle line:90%
Am I OK?

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
absolutely right.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, nowadays,
and I'm gonna cite an example.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
A lady posted from St.
Louis a couple of days ago,

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
she's having problems
with her husband.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And she is airing all
her laundry on Facebook.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Exactly.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I've got friends
that are calling me saying,

00:07:25.965 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:90%
you've got to look at this.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.190 align:middle line:90%
This is unbelievable.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's talking about
all the horrendous things

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
that are happening in her
life, in her relationship.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.450 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen this before.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yeah.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:90%
See, it's all got to come out.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:84%
In this journey, you can't
take your baggage with you.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So all of the baggage that says,
I'm not OK, I'm not attractive,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't fit, I'm not going to
succeed, all of those things.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:84%
When you really
think about that,

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
what happens is a person growing
up is exploring their life.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
figure things out.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And the mom, dad,
teacher, minister

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.550 align:middle line:84%
of the world all of a sudden
says, I have a gift for you.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.140 align:middle line:90%
You're not OK.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:90%
How dare you?

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Why do you do that?

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is we
unconsciously accept the gift,

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and then we begin to ask the
worst question you can ask.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:90%
What did I do wrong?

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
In real terms, that was
somebody else's bad lifetime

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
in that moment just
vomiting all over you.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
But we accept it,
hold onto it, and then

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of our life
figure out what did I do wrong?

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not successful?

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:84%
What all of that is beginning
to come to the surface.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I
say you can't take

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:84%
your baggage on this journey
into this fifth dimensional

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.710 align:middle line:90%
state of well being.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a channeler
by the name of Lee Harris, who

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.930 align:middle line:84%
appeared on Gaia's "Open Minds"
to talk about this shift.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.146 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE HARRIS:
Higher consciousness

00:08:51.146 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:10%
has become higher,
meaning so many

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:10%
of you in the past decade
or two have ascended

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:10%
much of your own
personal density,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:10%
meaning the next levels
of higher consciousness

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.050 align:middle line:10%
are now hitting the planet.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Many of you will
have experienced

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:84%
a temporal hold on consciousness
in some ways between 2012

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.330 align:middle line:90%
and 2016.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And now as you move
into the 2017 to 2025

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.680 align:middle line:84%
period, what we would
call golden consciousness

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:90%
is hitting the earth.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Far from the seductive
name it sounds to be,

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:84%
it is quite destructive,
for it will destroy density

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
at faster rates, which is
why at a planetary level,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.350 align:middle line:84%
you are seeing this take
place, and at personal levels,

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.530 align:middle line:84%
those of you who had long felt
what you would call awake,

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
alive, ascended are finding
that suddenly the speed is

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:84%
increasing all over
again and you are going

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:84%
deeper and further
out than humans

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.965 align:middle line:90%
have for a very long time.

00:09:47.965 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:84%
For we will say
that back in time,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
humans were able to go very
far for a short period of time,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.990 align:middle line:84%
before what you would know as
the energetic clamp got put

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:84%
onto the mindset and the
energy field of humanity.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:84%
That clamp, which is
now in an almighty

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:90%
battle to restore itself.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily for the
purposes of humanity,

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:84%
but instead for the
purposes of the universe.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, do
you agree with him?

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Absolutely.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.640 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:84%
That message is
completely right on.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Lee does a really good
job with his work.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
But what is being said is,
here's this change coming.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And the change is
going to take us

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
into a state of well being
that is not something you can--

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:84%
the average person can
conceive of at this point.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Technological changes,
biological changes.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Changes in
consciousness are going

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:84%
to be extreme in terms of very,
very positive, amazing things.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:84%
However, you can't take
your baggage with you

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:90%
on this journey.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So this wave that Lee's
talking about here

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:84%
is basically a
wave of dislocating

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:84%
a lot of your junk, that belief
system that says I'm not OK.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, that mental,
emotional process

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.900 align:middle line:84%
is one of the consequences
of the fall of consciousness.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:84%
The mental and emotional
body got separated.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, you have a thought,
and it's an unmanaged thought.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Something jumps up in front of
you and you go, this is not OK.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But immediately, I'm really
angry comes and combines

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:90%
with that thought.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And you get a reactionary
impulse that screams or yells

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
change very quickly.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this shift affecting
anything on the planet?

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: It's
affecting everything

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, in the
solar system, in the sun,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:90%
but mostly you.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you say in the
sun, what do you mean by that?

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: See, this is an
interesting thing that goes on.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.671 align:middle line:84%
The sun is beginning
to be understood.

00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Scientifically, it's
beginning to be understood.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, we just
sent a probe to the sun.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:46.869 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Oh, yeah, but--

00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:47.951 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly remarkable.

00:11:47.951 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Remarkable.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But what's more
remarkable is when

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
you understand
that sunspots have

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:84%
negative and positive
polarities and they

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.700 align:middle line:90%
create these solar flares.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Those positive,
negative polarities

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and the motion in the
sunspots is directly related

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:84%
to the high and low pressure
situation on the earth.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:84%
The electrical blast
of those solar winds

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.102 align:middle line:84%
relates to the
electrical lightning

00:12:13.102 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that's going on every minute
of the day on the Earth.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Might it also
reflect the consciousness

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:90%
and the mood of people?

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Absolutely.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somehow it's
sucking that energy in?

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: So when you begin to
look at thoughts are electrical

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and emotions are magnetic
and one of the things that's

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:84%
beginning to happen
is, not only are

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
the poles as you shifting
into different positions,

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.990 align:middle line:84%
but the magnetic intensity
of the field around the Earth

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:90%
is decreasing significantly.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And the magnetic field
is, to a great extent,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
what holds emotional structure
in the physical body.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So as that begins to
lessen and lessen,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.270 align:middle line:84%
you're starting to
see this cosmic rays

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
processed transitioned
through the sun

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and then produced
back on the Earth.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing
changes in the Earth,

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
but you're seeing changes in
the mental, emotional state

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:90%
of human beings.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, what is the
fall of consciousness?

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: So, if you
were to say it really--

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.570 align:middle line:90%
it's an amazing story.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But the simpleness
is the creator wished

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.850 align:middle line:90%
to know itself at one point.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm paraphrasing.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Reached into itself
and created a handful

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:90%
of creator gods, small g.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Beings in the light that went
out and were told to create.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.310 align:middle line:84%
But in that process in their
creation, some of those beings

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
began to enjoy their creative
nature more than using

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:90%
the light of the creation.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.132 align:middle line:84%
And so they began to
create these wobbles.

00:13:35.132 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Now, they weren't bad beings.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.172 align:middle line:90%
There was no war.

00:13:37.172 --> 00:13:38.130 align:middle line:90%
There was no bad angel.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
the fallen ones?

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, that's what
the system would call them.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The system would.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:90%
The Bible would.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.075 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: But they're
the ones that

00:13:44.075 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
basically started using their
light to create realities.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And without the
light of the creator,

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:84%
there began to be
mutations and distortions.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And those mutations
and distortions

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:84%
started working their
way into the density,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
as you began to get more
and more dense, all part

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:90%
of the experiment of creation.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:84%
There began to be
kind of wobbles

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that we would call anger,
rage, jealousy, resentment.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.300 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That they
passed onto us.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: They passed on to us.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:90%
So in that process when the--

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:84%
my example would be it
would be like a chemistry

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.190 align:middle line:84%
lab was an experiment, and all
of a sudden, the experiment

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:90%
blew up.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, in order to keep the
fire from consuming everything,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle line:84%
in my analogy, they
shut down the lab.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
But many great beings
of consciousness

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:90%
are still in that lab.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:90%
You and I are in that lab.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the process of
the game now of the lab,

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:84%
because creation said, well,
let's see how this works.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you started to get
a third dimensional state.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Everything has rules
and structures.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.877 align:middle line:84%
Third dimension has
rules and structures.

00:14:51.877 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, going
back to the question of

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:84%
have you ever played a game
without knowing the rules.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Third dimension is all about
duality, good, bad, right,

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.490 align:middle line:84%
wrong, separation, but it's
about one thing in particular

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
that is seen as an
absolute, and that's time.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.600 align:middle line:84%
See, time, if you ask
100 people on the street,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.840 align:middle line:84%
is time, what it is, they'll
tell you past, present, future,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:90%
then you die.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
time in the third dimension

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:90%
is not present at all.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.540 align:middle line:84%
It's in, oh, I hope
I didn't do it wrong

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and it won't affect
me in the future.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.794 align:middle line:84%
Or I hope they never find
out, so I'm going to change.

00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you get into
that little sliver

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:84%
of third dimensional present
time, it's reactionary.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have choice.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, oh my god, this
wasn't supposed to happen.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Third dimensional present time.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.860 align:middle line:90%
But time is an application.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fixed concept.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So as you and I
both know, when you

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:84%
start to get into present
time, like right here

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:90%
we're in present time.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:84%
We're not thinking
about lunch or dinner.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Right here we are present.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:84%
In fourth dimension, which
is a nonphysical dimension,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
you play in thought form
to a great extent in there.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But fourth dimension
has present time.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no past,
there is no future.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is
no past or future.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: In that present time
moment, you have choice.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Where in third dimension,
you have reaction.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
something that's

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:90%
so important to this shift.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
You have an odd
word called paradox,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
which simply means what was
true a minute ago may not

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:90%
be true now.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And what was false
may not be false.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So in third
dimension, when I say,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.200 align:middle line:84%
well, I know that
person over there.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:90%
They're bad.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.540 align:middle line:90%
They're never going to be good.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:90%
They're always.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Very rigid structures.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:84%
But 20 years later
somebody shows up

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:84%
on my porch that stole money
from me a long time ago.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Third dimensionally,
I can say, I know you.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Get off my porch.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:84%
But in this fifth
dimensional space

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:84%
we're stepping into, well
being, fourth dimension also, I

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:84%
look at you and I
realize the history,

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
but I allow the opportunity for
you to be different paradox.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
That's the mechanism
that everybody

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:90%
is going to start to recognize.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I stole the candy bar
when I was five years old,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and I'm a bad person.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.584 align:middle line:84%
Well, at 45, would you
like to bring that concept

00:17:11.584 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:84%
into present time and look at
it, and is it really still--

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're a
different person now.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Something you want to
hold yourself accountable for.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the baggage that
is being purged out

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:90%
of everybody's space.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.930 align:middle line:84%
That comment that Lee
made that this is not

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
going to be a joyful transition,
this golden light that's

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not destructive,
but it is disruptive.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not a destruction,
but it is causing--

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is the disruption good?

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, it's
causing your status quo,

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
how I hold onto my not
OK-ness, to be disrupted.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
You can't take your baggage
with you on this journey.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And so if a person
began to understand

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that there are tools and
means of managing yourself,

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.950 align:middle line:84%
you would be able to perceive
the world differently.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did the
big G, the big God,

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
allow the little g's to do what
they had to do and not fix it

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:90%
from the get go?

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Because
it wasn't broken.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's an experience
of creation.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
See, third dimension,
you would say bad, good.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
But in the concept of creation,
it's just an experience.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.610 align:middle line:90%
So when you can--

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.260 align:middle line:84%
as you evolving into an
ascending, evolving creator

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.950 align:middle line:84%
being, you George, me
Jim, evolving into that,

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:90%
there really aren't failures.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.460 align:middle line:84%
There are just things
that are, oops,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.994 align:middle line:90%
that didn't work real well.

00:18:33.994 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:90%
So now think about it.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.480 align:middle line:84%
If you can step back and
say oops to something.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.990 align:middle line:90%
How do I deal with this?

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of fluidity,
mobility, flexibility

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.190 align:middle line:90%
to deal with that circumstance.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.980 align:middle line:84%
But if it's, oh my
god, this isn't good,

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:84%
then it's very rigid,
and there's not

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:84%
a lot of choice in how
do you resolve something.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are the
teachers of light?

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: The teachers of
light are, to great extent,

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
these beings that didn't fall
in the fall of consciousness,

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:90%
which is 99.999% of everything.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
This fall is a very
little experience.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Very small.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the Bible makes
it seem like it's everything.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.859 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, the Bible only
knows what the Bible knows.

00:19:14.859 --> 00:19:16.275 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean that
disrespectfully.

00:19:16.275 --> 00:19:17.358 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I understand.

00:19:17.358 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: But what happens
is the story has basically

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
been created from that fall of
consciousness got very rigid.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
There's an aspect
when they had to stop

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.690 align:middle line:84%
the fall, that everything
would have been dismantled,

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:90%
destroyed, gone.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, they created,
let's call it a box.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And the box was filled with
cement, and everybody in it

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.760 align:middle line:90%
was caught.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.102 align:middle line:90%
Stuck.

00:19:43.102 --> 00:19:43.902 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Stuck.

00:19:43.902 --> 00:19:48.600 align:middle line:84%
But as evolution went on, as
creator, as all the beings

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
that weren't in it,
wanted to resolve this,

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.550 align:middle line:90%
they applied something.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:84%
They began to apply the
feminine nature of the creator.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, here this is a big
masculine, feminine.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not about bodies.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not about men are from
Mars, women are from Venus.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Feminine energy has no
straight lines or angles.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It's swirls and it's motion.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.870 align:middle line:84%
It's what if, I
wonder, how could we.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:90%
No angles.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Straight lines and
angles are masculine.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Very much structure.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So the feminine says, gee,
I wonder how we do this.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And the masculine side of
you says, we can do this.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:90%
I can build this.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:90%
I can make this happen.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
In that fall of
consciousness, the feminine

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:84%
was brought in first to
nurture, to fertilize, to grow.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
But as it began to loosen
up, the masculine side

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:90%
was dominated by the feminine.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to fix this.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:84%
As it loosened up, the
masculine side got really angry

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:90%
and overtook the feminine side.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And basically, if you look at
the Bible, you look at history,

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
look at the Middle East, you
see those really fundamental

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:90%
positions.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Not making them right or wrong.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But they only know
what they know,

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's that anger and rage.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's very much
dominating and feminine is

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:90%
submissive or not even valued.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we the world around
us or is the world what we are?

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: We believe that I
am a result of the world.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:90%
I look for you to like me.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
I look for my safety based
on what they say out there.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So the average
person walking around

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:84%
is very consumed with how
they relate to others.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:90%
But what's--

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too much so?

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Too much so.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I give up
my seniority to you.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.082 align:middle line:84%
The mom, dad, teacher,
minister say, you're bad.

00:21:43.082 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do it right.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:44.840 align:middle line:90%
You're not OK.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:90%
You'll never succeed.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I accept that and
then ask the question,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.220 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong with me?

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:84%
When in fact, nothing's
wrong with me at all.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I was just trying
to figure it out.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So this shift is
in process to where

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:03.240 align:middle line:84%
if you began to understand how
you can navigate this shift,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.260 align:middle line:84%
you would navigate
it very differently.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:84%
You hear people say, well,
my space and your space.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is that?

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's our space, right?

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well yeah, but sometimes
people step into my space.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:90%
And I withdraw.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.190 align:middle line:90%
I pull back.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.185 align:middle line:84%
So if you were able to have
an understanding of that,

00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'll give you a
simple tool that we

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
teach in the course of
mastering alchemy is basically

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:90%
if you knew--

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.849 align:middle line:90%
the edge of your aura starts--

00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:84%
if you put your arms
straight out in front of you

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and put your palm towards you,
your aura basically all the way

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:90%
around you at that position.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like this?

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yep.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:90%
And over.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you were able to
create a point of delineation,

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:84%
meaning you know what
a rose looks like.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.019 align:middle line:84%
So let's create an
image of a rose.

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to put that
right on the edge of my aura.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.685 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
make a decision.

00:22:48.685 --> 00:22:51.390 align:middle line:90%
From here to my heart is me.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And everything out there
is Shakespeare's theater

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:90%
to entertain me.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And if I could stay on
my side and the game

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.770 align:middle line:84%
is stay on your side, all
of a sudden you being angry

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:84%
or they being upset
over there begins

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
to be something that
doesn't have to affect me.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But without that
point of delineation,

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:84%
not knowing where I
kind of start and stop

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.310 align:middle line:84%
in a manner of speaking,
when that person gets upset,

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I become the effect of
it, whether they're really

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:90%
looking me--

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I get upset when other
people around me get upset.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:84%
You begin to recognize that this
is me and that's the theater.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
The ability to manage
yourself with choice

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.820 align:middle line:90%
begins to be black and white.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.950 align:middle line:84%
All of sudden, you
realize all of that

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:90%
has nothing to do with me.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: At all.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the theater passing by.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It's all of those
people and they're

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:90%
play acting out in their play.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:84%
I am just a bypasser
in their play.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.660 align:middle line:84%
As you moved through life and
you think about all the things

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that you hold yourself
hostage to, if you could look

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:84%
at those movies, you'd
realize you were just

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:84%
walking through somebody's
play more often than not.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.480 align:middle line:90%
And you made a decision.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I interfered with them.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do it right.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.130 align:middle line:90%
I was bad.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the baggage
that's got to come out.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we
rewrite the play?

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Absolutely.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.630 align:middle line:84%
See, one of the
things when you get

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.390 align:middle line:84%
into present time, that fourth
dimensional, fifth dimensional

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:26.370 align:middle line:84%
space, and you recognize choice,
what happens is my past--

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.750 align:middle line:90%
in third dimension, I did this.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:90%
My mother died.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:84%
She didn't like me, and
I'm a consequence of that.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But here when you basically
get into present time

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and you look at your
past, it's simply

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:90%
history as far as information.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:47.250 align:middle line:84%
What we do is we say,
oh, my husband, wife

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:90%
died 20 years ago, and I'm sad.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.220 align:middle line:84%
If you really look
at it, emotions

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.520 align:middle line:84%
are only experienced
in the present moment.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And so in that place
where you have a thought

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and you immediately
unconsciously bind

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:84%
an emotion, that
event is my husband,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:90%
wife died 20 years ago.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.585 align:middle line:90%
It's a piece of information.

00:25:07.585 --> 00:25:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: The emotion is
what you choose to add

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.240 align:middle line:90%
to that piece of information.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you could manage
yourself in a way

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.390 align:middle line:84%
to where you can
look at your history

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:21.247 align:middle line:84%
and then ask the question,
does this have value to me?

00:25:21.247 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find
that most of what

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
we call memory is something
we hold in our space

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.300 align:middle line:84%
as a past event is going
to simply evaporate

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:90%
from your reality.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, what do they
mean by rewiring the brain?

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: So when in all
the work that we do,

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
manage yourself

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:84%
on this side of your rose, as
an example, you become grounded.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.770 align:middle line:84%
You begin to look
through your eyes

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.090 align:middle line:90%
from the center of your head.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:90%
And you begin to open the heart.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.910 align:middle line:84%
You start to begin to recognize
that I am in the world,

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:90%
but I am not of that world.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
You begin to choose
your engagement.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's your own world.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And so then
one of the things

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that has been made available
is we know the word chakras.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing to me
that chakras work--

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:90%
we work as well as we do.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Those lower four chakras are
fragmented, broken, shut down,

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:15.470 align:middle line:90%
to a great extent.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.540 align:middle line:84%
But one of the newer
pieces of information

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is you can rearrange
these upper chakras

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.630 align:middle line:84%
into a different
configuration that

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:27.260 align:middle line:84%
allows you to start to step
into that unified field

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness, all that is.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
It's in that place that you
start to remember yourself.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the
remembering yourself

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.870 align:middle line:84%
you begin to remember how
to put you back together.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
There's something
in the head that--

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:84%
there's something referred
to as the eye of Horus.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:84%
The eye of Horus is not a
necklace or a mystery school.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:84%
The eye of Horus is
a very specific set

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:50.884 align:middle line:90%
of connections in the brain.

00:26:50.884 --> 00:26:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the brain.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.910 align:middle line:90%
And we all have that.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Everybody has it.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And so when you begin to play
with this reconfiguration

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.900 align:middle line:84%
of these upper
chakras and you start

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:84%
to activate that
eye of Horus, one

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.130 align:middle line:84%
of the really valuable
things that happens

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.100 align:middle line:84%
is what people call psychic
abilities or spiritual ability,

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyance, clairsentience,
telepathy, clairaudience.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.690 align:middle line:84%
That eye of Horus begins to
bring them into a functioning

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.840 align:middle line:84%
role and allows you
to start to perceive

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.550 align:middle line:90%
your reality from that space.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean picking
lottery tickets.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I simply mean you
begin to see a reality

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
that if I do this two
weeks out in front of me,

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:90%
here is the result of that.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
You begin to find that
things like telepathy

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.040 align:middle line:84%
of great value, that place where
people finish other people's

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:36.840 align:middle line:90%
sentences.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.870 align:middle line:84%
That's just narrow
band telepathy.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, it's an
embarrassing, it's a bad thing.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, not really.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.126 align:middle line:84%
If you can begin to know what's
the next set of thoughts,

00:27:46.126 --> 00:27:48.251 align:middle line:84%
the next sentence, the next
concept that somebody's

00:27:48.251 --> 00:27:48.630 align:middle line:90%
going to have--

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.463 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:27:49.463 --> 00:27:50.730 align:middle line:90%
You're way ahead of the game.

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.675 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: --you can basically
say, what if we did this?

00:27:53.675 --> 00:27:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Would this make it
simpler in your life?

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Joe Dispenza talked
about rewiring the brain as

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:90%
well and how it affects reality.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.710 align:middle line:10%
>>JOE DISPENZA: So then
as the environment turns

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.840 align:middle line:10%
on different circuits
in your brain,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:10%
you begin to think equal
to your environment.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.260 align:middle line:84%
As you see the same people
and go to the same places

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and do the same things
at the same time,

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:84%
it's the external
environment that's

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:84%
turning on different
circuits in your brain,

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
causing you to think equal
to everything that you know.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you think
equal to everything

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.930 align:middle line:84%
that's familiar or
known to you, what

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.510 align:middle line:90%
do you keep creating more of?

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:90%
The same life.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, the quantum law is
still applying to you.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.770 align:middle line:84%
You're just thinking equal
to everything that you know.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And you keep creating
more of the same.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.960 align:middle line:84%
To change, to truly
change, is to think greater

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:90%
than your environment.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And every great person
in history knew this.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was William
Wallace or Mahatma Gandhi

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.820 align:middle line:84%
or Martin Luther King or Queen
Elizabeth I or Joan of Arc,

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:90%
they all had a vision.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:58.610 align:middle line:90%
They all had an idea.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't see it, couldn't
smell it, couldn't taste it,

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.930 align:middle line:90%
couldn't feel it.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:90%
But it was alive in their mind.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:84%
It was so alive in
their mind that they

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.960 align:middle line:84%
began to live as if that reality
was actually happening now.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So can you believe
in a future that you

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:20.180 align:middle line:84%
can't see or experience
with your senses yet

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.120 align:middle line:84%
but you've thought about
enough times in your mind

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:84%
that your brain is
literally changed

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.820 align:middle line:84%
to look like the event
has already happened?

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.887 align:middle line:84%
Neuroscience says it's
absolutely possible.

00:29:31.887 --> 00:29:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's right.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: He's absolutely right.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you think it is or you
think it isn't, you're correct.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:40.430 align:middle line:10%
So one of the
things that happens

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:10%
with this is as you start
to get into this space

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:10%
of present time, as you
begin to define your space,

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.620 align:middle line:10%
as you begin to
recognize that's theater

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.130 align:middle line:10%
but it's not my theater, you
begin to turn on the chakras.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:84%
You begin to change
aspects of yourself.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:58.730 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's going
to be understood going forward

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:90%
is time and space are one thing.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:90%
They're not two.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
into present time

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to sit in present
time, everything comes to you.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.047 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go out
there to find your reality.

00:30:14.047 --> 00:30:15.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's just like Joe's saying.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:84%
If I can imagine
it, I can create it.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.090 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find
in this shifting times

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:25.130 align:middle line:84%
that we're in something that
is being very obvious now

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.335 align:middle line:90%
called AI intelligence.

00:30:27.335 --> 00:30:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It is being received in a
technological manner in terms

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:84%
of instruments
and the technology

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.290 align:middle line:90%
we live in the external world.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But that AI intelligence
is an aspect

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:43.430 align:middle line:84%
of how the soul perceives
itself in the larger

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:90%
scope of the universe.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the choices that is
coming about is, in a way,

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.820 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole new human
species being created.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And that human species
is going to begin

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
I am absolutely

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:90%
the center of everything.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:02.120 align:middle line:84%
It's as if we could take
you and put you in space

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.010 align:middle line:90%
in a little bubble in a chair.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:07.385 align:middle line:84%
And surrounding you was
thousands of television sets,

00:31:07.385 --> 00:31:09.710 align:middle line:90%
in a manner of speaking.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.610 align:middle line:84%
The law of attraction
is absolutely flawless.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:84%
What you put your
attention on is

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:18.200 align:middle line:84%
what you experience or
create for yourself.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.900 align:middle line:84%
In that space of sitting in
that little bubble, as you

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.340 align:middle line:84%
begin to think a thought, one
of those televisions lights up.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you hold that thought,
the law of attraction

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.540 align:middle line:84%
is going to start to
pull that reality more

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.760 align:middle line:90%
and more into your space.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.580 align:middle line:84%
As the brain shifts,
as the consciousness

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.172 align:middle line:84%
shifts, the ability to basically
know yourself in ways that you

00:31:38.172 --> 00:31:39.380 align:middle line:90%
can't even imagine right now.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.254 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will this happen
automatically, Jim,

00:31:41.254 --> 00:31:43.462 align:middle line:84%
or do people have
to be aware of this?

00:31:43.462 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: It's happening.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For this shift.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:46.248 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: It's happening.

00:31:46.248 --> 00:31:48.590 align:middle line:84%
But there's kind of two
stratas of consciousness

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.920 align:middle line:90%
that are unfolding.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.680 align:middle line:84%
There's the strata
of consciousness

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.350 align:middle line:84%
where those that are terrified
and digging in their heels

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and arguing for their
limitations, the ones that

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:01.730 align:middle line:84%
think war is necessary in order
to keep domination and control,

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.820 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of becoming
a strata of consciousness

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.650 align:middle line:84%
that that attractively that
mindset is drawing to itself.

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.050 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
law, another strata

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:14.630 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
of those waking up.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Those that are beginning
to understand well being

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.480 align:middle line:84%
is about respect, dignity,
appreciation, gratitude,

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:84%
humility, kindness,
laughter, co-creation.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.970 align:middle line:84%
See, that's a place where
you and I and so many

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:84%
others listening to
the show are living.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.190 align:middle line:90%
They know there is a better way.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And in their heart,
they would rather

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.980 align:middle line:84%
align with well being and
kindness than this place

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.470 align:middle line:90%
of domination and imposition.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And so in a way,
you're beginning

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:45.740 align:middle line:84%
to see two Earths starting
to create into two stratas.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these two Earths
technically collide one day?

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: They will eventually.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:55.130 align:middle line:84%
This Earth of war, domination
will begin to burn itself out.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And that level of
consciousness will be right

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.780 align:middle line:84%
where we are today,
saying this is too much.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.310 align:middle line:90%
There's got to be another way.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And the minute they begin
to ask that question,

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.050 align:middle line:84%
that level of light begins to
open up again in the heart.

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And they'll ease
their way out of it.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But there'll be two
stratas for quite a while.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.580 align:middle line:84%
There was a long period where
we hoped that it would just

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:90%
be one Earth.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
layers are out there?

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Layers?

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In terms
of what we think

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.530 align:middle line:84%
are different layers
of consciousness.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, let me answer
that slightly differently.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.720 align:middle line:84%
What layer of thought
are you perceiving from?

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's slightly different.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.460 align:middle line:84%
See, we think in
different layers.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think in let's
call a third dimensional layer,

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.870 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:38.786 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:33:38.786 --> 00:33:41.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: So you have an
aspect where I need this

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.429 align:middle line:84%
and I want this and oh, this
has got to work this way.

00:33:44.429 --> 00:33:45.345 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I to have it.

00:33:45.345 --> 00:33:47.435 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: The have to
is the leaning into.

00:33:47.435 --> 00:33:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's call that the
third layer of thought where

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.990 align:middle line:90%
there's emotions and needs.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Fourth layer of thought,
let's call it pondering,

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.977 align:middle line:84%
where we just think and say,
gee, I wonder how that works.

00:33:57.977 --> 00:33:59.060 align:middle line:90%
This could be interesting.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But you don't really
need the answer.

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:03.690 align:middle line:90%
You're just allowing it to gel.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:08.310 align:middle line:84%
In that space is where most
of us are starting to move.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.635 align:middle line:84%
The place where you realize,
I don't need to go to,

00:34:11.635 --> 00:34:12.510 align:middle line:90%
and all of a sudden--

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just let it happen.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.759 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Everything
begins to happen.

00:34:14.759 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Something very magical
happens in that space also.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:84%
You begin to realize
that the answer lies

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:90%
where the question is asked.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:84%
In that third layer,
I need moves me away

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:27.080 align:middle line:84%
from where I'm
asking the question.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.380 align:middle line:84%
In that pondering, I wonder how
this works, how many times have

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:90%
you go, oh, I got it.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.620 align:middle line:84%
The answer lies always right
where the question is asked.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.420 align:middle line:90%
We move away.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:43.679 align:middle line:84%
In this fourth layer, you
begin to allow the possibility

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.150 align:middle line:90%
of everything to come to you.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
layers are there?

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.024 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: I'm going to say
for this discussion seven.

00:34:49.024 --> 00:34:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Seven layers?

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yeah.

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So the fifth layer is where you
go into a layer of awareness.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:59.340 align:middle line:84%
You hear words, but you're
not thinking thoughts.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.070 align:middle line:84%
A sixth layer is
more complicated.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where you
don't think a thought,

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.600 align:middle line:90%
and there's no movement.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.590 align:middle line:90%
I say apple.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:10.020 align:middle line:84%
You don't move to, oh,
I know what an apple is.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It just begins to be
a vibrational field

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.260 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.060 align:middle line:10%
That's a place that everything's
about to go to and change.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's the seventh
layer where you

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.430 align:middle line:84%
think in alignment with the
thought that thought you

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:24.980 align:middle line:90%
into creation.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:29.060 align:middle line:84%
You and that thought
of soul are one.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's very powerful.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: That's
extremely powerful.

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a gift,
in terms of you

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.480 align:middle line:84%
don't just automatically
go, I want that.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.300 align:middle line:84%
It is that rewiring,
remembering,

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:84%
realigning yourself
and then becoming aware

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.650 align:middle line:84%
of the next level
of consciousness

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and then absorbing
and remembering

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.910 align:middle line:90%
who you've always been.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But in this fallen state
of separation duality,

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.185 align:middle line:90%
we've lost track of ourselves.

00:35:53.185 --> 00:35:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
layer that's better

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.400 align:middle line:84%
than the other of the
seven you mentioned,

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.441 align:middle line:90%
or are they all the same?

00:35:57.441 --> 00:35:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: No, they're all
transitional processes

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.261 align:middle line:90%
that we go through.

00:36:00.261 --> 00:36:01.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You need them all.

00:36:01.385 --> 00:36:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yes.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But you can, as you
begin to understand

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.600 align:middle line:84%
managing your energy,
managing yourself, choosing

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.150 align:middle line:84%
a reality, you basically move
in and out of those layers

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.770 align:middle line:90%
of thought at will.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.844 align:middle line:84%
But it starts from being
here and observing and being

00:36:16.844 --> 00:36:17.760 align:middle line:90%
conscious of yourself.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.051 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain, and we'll
look at a clip in a second,

00:36:20.051 --> 00:36:22.120 align:middle line:90%
but what is neuroplasticity?

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: It's really how the
brain is all put together

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that,
just like Joe said,

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.530 align:middle line:84%
if you think these
thoughts and you

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:31.470 align:middle line:84%
accept your environment, that's
pretty much the game you play.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
is that to what we're

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.010 align:middle line:90%
talking about today?

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: It's everything.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.380 align:middle line:84%
It's about the ability to
change your point of attention

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.020 align:middle line:84%
and begin to draw to
you what you would like

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to have happen rather than
accepting the world that

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.800 align:middle line:84%
shows up on your
doorstep every morning.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back
to school and look

00:36:48.508 --> 00:36:50.820 align:middle line:90%
at a course on neuroplasticity.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Not so long
ago, many scientists

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.850 align:middle line:10%
believed that the brain did not
change after childhood, that it

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.500 align:middle line:10%
was hardwired and fixed by
the time we became adults.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But recent advances in
only the last decade

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.760 align:middle line:84%
now tell us that this
is simply not true.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.260 align:middle line:10%
The brain can and does
change throughout our lives.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.445 align:middle line:10%
It is adaptable, like plastic.

00:37:12.445 --> 00:37:17.160 align:middle line:10%
Hence, neuroscientists
call this neuroplasticity.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.780 align:middle line:90%
How does neuroplasticity work?

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.790 align:middle line:84%
If you think of your brain as a
dynamic, connected power grid,

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.100 align:middle line:84%
there are billions
of pathways or roads

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:31.290 align:middle line:84%
lighting up every time you
think, feel, or do something.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of these roads
are well traveled.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:10%
These are our habits, our
established ways of thinking,

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:10%
feeling, and doing.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.890 align:middle line:10%
Every time we think
in a certain way,

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:44.670 align:middle line:10%
practice a particular task,
or feel a specific emotion,

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.650 align:middle line:10%
we strengthen this road.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:84%
It becomes easier for our
brains to travel this pathway.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So we think about something
differently, learn a new task,

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:56.670 align:middle line:90%
or choose a different emotion.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.160 align:middle line:90%
We start carving out a new road.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.410 align:middle line:84%
If we keep traveling
that road, our brains

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:04.445 align:middle line:84%
begin to use this pathway
more and this new way

00:38:04.445 --> 00:38:08.990 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, feeling, or
doing becomes second nature.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:13.010 align:middle line:84%
The old pathway gets used
less and less and weakens.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:14.900 align:middle line:84%
This process of
rewiring your brain

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.990 align:middle line:84%
by forming new connections
and weakening old ones

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.300 align:middle line:90%
is neuroplasticity in action.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.810 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that we all
have the ability to learn

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and change by
rewiring our brains.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:84%
If you have ever
changed a bad habit

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.440 align:middle line:84%
or thought about
something differently,

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.620 align:middle line:84%
you have caused a
pathway in your brain

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and experienced
neuroplasticity firsthand.

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.980 align:middle line:10%
With repeated and directed
attention towards your desired

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:43.511 align:middle line:10%
change, you can
rewire your brain.

00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
pretty accurate?

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:46.576 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Absolutely accurate.

00:38:46.576 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And the key to that was
changing your thoughts

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:50.760 align:middle line:90%
and changing your emotions.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when you begin to
think different thoughts

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and begin to think different
emotions or feelings--

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to distinguish
between the two--

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:84%
you start to create
a different reality.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, this shift
of consciousness,

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.170 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about a moment
ago with the magnetic fields

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:09.649 align:middle line:84%
and magnetic poles of the
Earth, shifting around.

00:39:09.649 --> 00:39:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they are shifting.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: And they are
shifting very rapidly.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:16.700 align:middle line:84%
The emotional body
is very magnetic.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And so as that
emotional alignment

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:84%
begins to shift in the body,
the ability to rewire the brain,

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:90%
the ability to turn it back on.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not so much
building the new brain.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.720 align:middle line:84%
It's really putting the old one
that's been disconnected back

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.140 align:middle line:90%
into a place.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going to start
to find this how you think

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.795 align:middle line:84%
and how you hold your
emotions being very specific.

00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:42.700 align:middle line:84%
See, there's a
challenge, though.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
rational mind, the one

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.020 align:middle line:90%
we generally think with.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Its job is to keep
you safe and have

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:52.280 align:middle line:84%
you fit in that third
dimensional space of approval.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And so soon as you start
to wander from a place that

00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:00.230 align:middle line:84%
is routinely hardwired
into how I run my life,

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.790 align:middle line:84%
the rational mind goes,
whoa, are you sure?

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:90%
This isn't good.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.080 align:middle line:90%
They may not like you.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that space of that
fourth dimensional present time

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.620 align:middle line:84%
space where you allow choice
to begin to come and play

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.980 align:middle line:90%
is a really big deal.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But the rational mind
also did something

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.990 align:middle line:84%
in this fall of consciousness
that's now beginning

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:90%
to be more understood.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.670 align:middle line:84%
The rational mind
created emotion.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:27.080 align:middle line:84%
It needed to navigate, and it
needed to determine, am I safe

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and do I fit in with
those over there?

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.070 align:middle line:90%
That one seems angry.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So it created a relationship,
a map that we call emotions,

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.790 align:middle line:90%
to a large extent.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And a great amount
of those emotions

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:43.100 align:middle line:90%
are vibrations that have edges.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about a word
like jealousy, resentment,

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:50.060 align:middle line:90%
anger, rage, there's edges.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:54.910 align:middle line:84%
You think about appreciation,
gratitude, certainty, kindness,

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:58.175 align:middle line:84%
capable, there's no
edges on those words.

00:40:58.175 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the heart
thinks from feelings.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.220 align:middle line:84%
The rational mind
thinks from emotion.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So as a person begins to get
into this present time state

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and begins to observe
that I'm in this world

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:15.890 align:middle line:84%
but not of that world, the
ability for the neuroplasticity

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:19.180 align:middle line:84%
to begin to actually
happen quickly

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.930 align:middle line:84%
begins to become more
remarkable and easy.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For those people
who can understand this,

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.490 align:middle line:84%
truly understand it, what
does it do for their life?

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: It allows you to watch
events that you had in the past

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.980 align:middle line:84%
got upset with and then
sat and spin for weeks.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Why'd they do that?

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Why'd they do that?

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Why'd they do that?

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.480 align:middle line:84%
To basically recognize
this is not about me.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, it gives
you, particularly when

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.500 align:middle line:84%
you begin to be into the space
where you think from the heart

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and you perceive and
this eye of Horus

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:54.500 align:middle line:84%
turns back on, the ability
to recognize that somebody

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.760 align:middle line:90%
is in a lot of pain.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:90%
It's pain talking.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.367 align:middle line:84%
It's not somebody-- it's
not that person talking.

00:42:00.367 --> 00:42:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you're able
to just watch and watch.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And when that person
becomes absolutely

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:08.870 align:middle line:84%
at their most vulnerable is
when you reach out and say,

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:10.010 align:middle line:90%
can I be of assistance?

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what happens
with like suicide victims?

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:16.100 align:middle line:84%
They're in so much
pain, emotional pain,

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.900 align:middle line:90%
and people don't read them.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:18.830 align:middle line:90%
They don't understand.

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Yeah.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I used to say one
thing about suicide,

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.820 align:middle line:90%
and it's never your idea.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.910 align:middle line:84%
It's somebody says you're
so bad, you're so bad,

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:26.810 align:middle line:90%
you're so bad.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.810 align:middle line:84%
You just simply shut off
all your opportunities

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:32.387 align:middle line:90%
to negate that.

00:42:32.387 --> 00:42:34.220 align:middle line:84%
But now it's getting
to be very interesting,

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.900 align:middle line:90%
because that part's still true.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But what I watch in people
who are committing suicide

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.710 align:middle line:84%
is the vibrational frequency
of this distraction,

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:46.100 align:middle line:84%
this noise of you
can't take your baggage

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.400 align:middle line:84%
with you is rising up so
much that people just simply

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.716 align:middle line:90%
can't take it anymore.

00:42:50.716 --> 00:42:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why is that?

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:54.048 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Think about the person
on the street that basically

00:42:54.048 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:90%
lost their home in 2008.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.640 align:middle line:84%
They lost their marriage
because they couldn't any longer

00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.780 align:middle line:90%
pay for their home.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Their kids are now
very upset because they

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:03.890 align:middle line:90%
can't go to the schools.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
you're watching this--

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they blame
you for it, right?

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: The circumstances
that the nature

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.080 align:middle line:90%
of how the world has gotten.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.650 align:middle line:84%
This level of where we give
so much power to money,

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:19.340 align:middle line:84%
that level of power to
money, the I have to have

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.270 align:middle line:90%
negates my humanity towards you.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:25.820 align:middle line:84%
If I can make money
here, I don't really

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.710 align:middle line:84%
have to be obligated
to you, to you.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Here it's because
of that structure.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:34.580 align:middle line:84%
But when all of a sudden you
watch things like 9/11 happen

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:40.057 align:middle line:84%
and New Yorkers with their
whatever their style is.

00:43:40.057 --> 00:43:42.390 align:middle line:84%
They took the shirts off their
back to help one another.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was just
gonna ask you about 9/11.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Because was it
normal and natural

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:53.420 align:middle line:84%
for people to go through
this horror when it happened?

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: When there is a
disruption of this nature,

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.750 align:middle line:84%
the best of humanity comes
out towards humanity.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It should.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: And it does.

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.780 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.550 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're in an odd transition.

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's an awkward transition.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So should we be helping all
those people from Syria,

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.650 align:middle line:84%
the millions of people
who have lost their lives?

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but all of a
sudden, the circumstances

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.880 align:middle line:84%
don't allow for my ability
to help other people,

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.140 align:middle line:90%
in some cases.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.590 align:middle line:84%
That level is bothering people,
I think, all over the world.

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:27.920 align:middle line:84%
This whole evolving into
this strata of consciousness

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.000 align:middle line:90%
of well being.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.475 align:middle line:84%
People are feeling for
other people's pain.

00:44:31.475 --> 00:44:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's good.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.205 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Oh, it's important,
and it's happening.

00:44:35.205 --> 00:44:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
level of consciousness

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.120 align:middle line:90%
growing for people?

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Absolutely.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So this awakening in this
shift of consciousness

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:43.880 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to
have people begin

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.310 align:middle line:90%
to recognize that's not OK.

00:44:46.310 --> 00:44:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I may not be
able to do something

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:84%
about the people in
Syria, but that's

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:55.340 align:middle line:84%
not OK is beginning to be a
vibrational resonance of not so

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.810 align:middle line:84%
much good and bad but as
I as a human being living

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:02.660 align:middle line:84%
in the heart, this
is inappropriate

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:03.920 align:middle line:90%
what I'm watching.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.962 align:middle line:90%
Man's inhumanity to man.

00:45:05.962 --> 00:45:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's horrible.

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: It is.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.945 align:middle line:90%
But it's changing.

00:45:08.945 --> 00:45:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With some of
these other dimensions,

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:15.200 align:middle line:84%
like the third, fourth,
or fifth, do they change?

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.400 align:middle line:90%
What do they contribute?

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: They all operate--
let's call them a box.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the box, like
that third dimension,

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.880 align:middle line:90%
is completely conditional.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.210 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing unconditional in
your third dimensional reality.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, you live in different
boxes simultaneously.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:33.050 align:middle line:84%
When you get into that
fourth, you have choice.

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the third,
you're in reaction.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:39.090 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth, things
begin to be unconditional.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Love, appreciation begins to
be something that's expressed.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, Barbara
Hand Clow of course,

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.670 align:middle line:84%
the author of "The Alchemy
Of Nine Dimensions"

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:48.950 align:middle line:84%
talks about these
upper dimensions

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:52.039 align:middle line:90%
on Gaia's "Open Minds."

00:45:52.039 --> 00:45:54.580 align:middle line:10%
>>BARBARA HAND CLOW: Well, all
of the higher five dimensions,

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.650 align:middle line:10%
fifth dimension through
ninth dimension,

00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:00.550 align:middle line:10%
penetrate the top of the canopy
and start moving down to 4D.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, those
impulses and consciousness

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that are coming in come down
into us in the third dimension.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.820 align:middle line:10%
So the reason that the
Pleiadians use a person

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.210 align:middle line:10%
on a healing table in order
to explain this dynamic

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.730 align:middle line:10%
is that they're trying to help
us understand how the lower

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:18.940 align:middle line:10%
dimensions below our
bodies are energizing us

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.780 align:middle line:10%
and then how our energy
and thoughts and emotions

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.027 align:middle line:10%
are flowing out of us
into the fourth dimension.

00:46:25.027 --> 00:46:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Because see, we create
the fourth dimension.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:31.000 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's a collective
area of consciousness

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.710 align:middle line:84%
is because it's coming
from us as humans.

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So then once you're into
the fourth dimension,

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:39.030 align:middle line:84%
for most people, what
you're dealing with

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.350 align:middle line:84%
is dualities, dark and
light, good and evil.

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole
fourth dimension

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.380 align:middle line:84%
is polarized into a
range of potentiality.

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.650 align:middle line:10%
And so what we need to
understand as human beings

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:53.110 align:middle line:10%
is that how we handle
the fourth dimension

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.900 align:middle line:10%
depends upon our
level of healing

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.630 align:middle line:10%
and upon our level
of mental clarity.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, being able to
deal with the fourth dimension

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:05.470 align:middle line:84%
involves activating our
minds, breaking the paradigms,

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:07.450 align:middle line:84%
getting a hold of
the real truth,

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and also processing
our emotional blocks

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:12.380 align:middle line:90%
and our emotional issues.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jim, she seems spot on.

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Absolutely.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.670 align:middle line:84%
She's saying it
absolutely right.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things about
this fourth dimension.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not a physical realm.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:23.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a thought realm.

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it works in a manner
where all the thoughts ever

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:30.500 align:middle line:84%
thought that did not turn
into physical actions

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.600 align:middle line:84%
are floating in that
fourth dimensional space.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And so as others have
spoken on your shows,

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:40.640 align:middle line:84%
there is-- let's look at the
fourth dimension as a set

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.310 align:middle line:90%
of layers just arbitrarily.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:45.800 align:middle line:90%
And that first layer is heavy.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:90%
It has lots of density.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:48.920 align:middle line:90%
It drops to the bottom.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.292 align:middle line:84%
Murder, rape, incest,
domination, slavery.

00:47:51.292 --> 00:47:52.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The worst of the worst.

00:47:52.625 --> 00:47:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: The worst of the worst.

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.166 align:middle line:84%
Up here on the
top, let's just say

00:47:55.166 --> 00:47:58.250 align:middle line:84%
eight layers for just
discussion, the butterflies

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and the puppy dog licking
the little baby's face

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and everybody goes,
oh, that's so nice.

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:05.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the space where if
you look at it, it's lighter.

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.250 align:middle line:90%
There's no heaviness.

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:08.210 align:middle line:90%
It flows.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.400 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
challenges to most of us

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.920 align:middle line:84%
in playing in the game
we've coming out of right

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.550 align:middle line:84%
now is you can have
fleeting, wonderful thoughts.

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
magnetism of I'm not OK,

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.000 align:middle line:84%
we have a tendency to
keep recirculating through

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.540 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not OK vibration.

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an
interesting place.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.930 align:middle line:84%
That lower fourth dimension
is really the equivalent

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.900 align:middle line:90%
to the biblical hell.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that
is it's interesting

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:41.210 align:middle line:84%
looking at numbers of studies
that have done in prisons where

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.610 align:middle line:84%
they basically say,
what is the thing that's

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.020 align:middle line:84%
most uncomfortable
in your space here?

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
going to sleep.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is if
you think about I hold--

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:54.189 align:middle line:84%
I just murdered somebody
and I'm angry and resentful.

00:48:54.189 --> 00:48:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you bring that in.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Well, that's my going,
that's my walking around space.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not happy with me.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:03.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'm angry at them.

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you go to
sleep, you basically--

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.750 align:middle line:84%
the etheric body, people
call it the astral body--

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Floats up.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Connects to the physical
body at the acupuncture points.

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.371 align:middle line:90%
And so those are little magnets.

00:49:16.371 --> 00:49:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
I'm going to sleep,

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:19.222 align:middle line:90%
the magnets begin to release.

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
body releases too.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.580 align:middle line:90%
It hovers, right?

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Well, hovers.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And what leaves is the mental,
emotional, the etheric body.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You leave, go into
that sleep space.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.100 align:middle line:84%
But if when you
go to sleep you're

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.590 align:middle line:84%
still in anger,
rage, and resentment,

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.120 align:middle line:90%
you start to go out.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:42.290 align:middle line:84%
You are magnetically attracted
fourth dimension astral plane

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:45.770 align:middle line:84%
to all the thoughts ever
thought like where I just

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.214 align:middle line:90%
left the body.

00:49:47.214 --> 00:49:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you put
yourself in your own hell.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Exactly.

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.539 align:middle line:84%
You're the creator
of that space.

00:49:51.539 --> 00:49:52.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you get out of it?

00:49:52.955 --> 00:49:55.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: You begin
to like yourself.

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Or you do begin to do
something very specific.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.660 align:middle line:90%
And I say this in all of our--

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.310 align:middle line:90%
in the book and everything else.

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Is when you go to sleep,
if you simply stop and make

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:09.660 align:middle line:84%
a decision, I'm going to
call myself back from my day.

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So if I said to you, where did
you leave yourself in your day?

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.430 align:middle line:90%
You'll tell me, having lunch.

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:16.754 align:middle line:90%
You'll tell me at the airport.

00:50:16.754 --> 00:50:18.170 align:middle line:84%
You'll tell me
just these thoughts

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:19.760 align:middle line:90%
all show up in your space.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.170 align:middle line:90%
That's where you left you.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:22.340 align:middle line:90%
So simple tool.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Create a gold sun over your
head, and being really simple,

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.050 align:middle line:90%
call yourself back.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Just call yourself back.

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.767 align:middle line:84%
Collect me up and
then fill me back up.

00:50:30.767 --> 00:50:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fill you back up.

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Really simple.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And make a decision that I want
to go on a different highway

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:38.270 align:middle line:90%
out tonight.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:39.830 align:middle line:90%
I want to go to the gardens.

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to play with
the elementals.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.400 align:middle line:90%
I want to play with the angels.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I want to play in beauty.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And as you have that thought
and you're falling asleep,

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.090 align:middle line:84%
just like the
neuroplasticity, you

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:53.180 align:middle line:84%
begin to create a
different pathway out

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.620 align:middle line:90%
of the body every night.

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How easy is
it for a human being

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:58.880 align:middle line:90%
to put themself in that state?

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: It's not easy.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.720 align:middle line:84%
It's simple, but simple and
easy aren't the same thing.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So basically, and this is what
mastering alchemy course is all

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.900 align:middle line:84%
about for us is how
do you basically

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.770 align:middle line:90%
get yourself into present time?

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So one of the alignments
that is very valuable

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:84%
is, again, thoughts
and emotions.

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So if I say to you, do you
know what certainty is?

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:26.420 align:middle line:84%
The rational mind goes, oh
yeah, I know what certainly is.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But if I say, close your eyes
and sit back, take a breath,

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and feel certain.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.650 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
different alignment.

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:37.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you can begin
to play with words.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:39.290 align:middle line:90%
And go back to the Bible.

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:41.090 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning was the Word.

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But before the
Word, what a word is

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:48.690 align:middle line:84%
is a sound tone, and uttering
a sound vibrational frequency.

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you could basically
begin to pick a set of words.

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Certain, capable, seniority,
present, gracious, happy.

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.506 align:middle line:90%
And feel the words.

00:51:58.506 --> 00:51:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And then one of
the games we play

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:03.470 align:middle line:84%
is feel certain and
then feel capable.

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're close.

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:05.600 align:middle line:90%
They're not the same.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But then puts certain and
capable together and maybe

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:09.692 align:middle line:90%
add happy.

00:52:09.692 --> 00:52:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
you begin to play

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:13.870 align:middle line:84%
with the platonic solids
and the geometries

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:16.360 align:middle line:84%
on an energetic level,
not on a physical level.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.230 align:middle line:84%
You begin to create a geometric
field that is required

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:22.160 align:middle line:90%
in physicalness and density.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And so certain, capable,
happy is an alignment,

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:31.060 align:middle line:84%
as an example, that is
structured versus random, just

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.010 align:middle line:84%
floating around,
not structured--

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:35.436 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
living light bodies?

00:52:35.436 --> 00:52:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Now you're
getting into a great part.

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So as you basically begin
to structure yourself,

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:45.250 align:middle line:84%
turn on the eye of Horus, begin
to define that's the theater

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'm fine, you
start to clear away

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:49.690 align:middle line:90%
an awful lot of your baggage.

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And that information
begins to be remembered.

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And as you play at, this
is an intentional decision,

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:84%
to evolve, to
ascend, to basically

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:04.570 align:middle line:84%
become fully conscious,
know yourself,

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.070 align:middle line:90%
the brain begins to change.

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Your access to the eighth,
ninth, 10th chakras

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:10.499 align:middle line:90%
begins to be simply information.

00:53:10.499 --> 00:53:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is a state we
should all be in, isn't it?

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Well, there's no should.

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:18.190 align:middle line:84%
But it is a place that
if you as an individual

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:22.300 align:middle line:84%
are interested in what's this
all about, how does it work,

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.620 align:middle line:90%
and there is more.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And most people when
they get into the heart

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.410 align:middle line:90%
know there's more.

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Then that third dimensional
game of war and punishment

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.970 align:middle line:90%
and domination.

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:33.040 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to get
into well being,

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.860 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to get into
this fifth dimensional state

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:39.070 align:middle line:84%
of well being,
appreciation, gratitude,

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:41.720 align:middle line:90%
you start to know yourself.

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.420 align:middle line:84%
You begin to move
from the rational mind

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.340 align:middle line:90%
to the fields of awareness.

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.540 align:middle line:84%
We'll call them simply
fourth layer of thought.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:53.140 align:middle line:84%
You just ask a question and
begin to know the information.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.390 align:middle line:84%
It's in that place
that you start

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:58.480 align:middle line:84%
engaging with the archangelics,
the lords of light.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.360 align:middle line:90%
You start to have a knowing.

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And that knowing allows you
to start to have a pathway.

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
mastering alchemy course,

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:11.980 align:middle line:84%
it's the lords of light,
it's the archangelics,

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and myself that
have conversations

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:16.720 align:middle line:90%
that are recordable, listen to.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.680 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.120 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to
turn that light body on,

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:25.910 align:middle line:84%
after the work of knowing
yourself, there's seven layers.

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:28.030 align:middle line:84%
There's seven more
strands of DNA.

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Only one of them relates
to the physical body.

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:33.310 align:middle line:84%
The other six relate to
the mental, the emotional,

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:37.390 align:middle line:84%
the causal, the over
soul, all of which

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:39.370 align:middle line:84%
is you beginning
to remember you.

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are children
more advanced than we are?

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Today they are.

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I thought.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: These new kids, they
come from many, many places.

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:48.580 align:middle line:84%
See, this shift is
taking us into a place

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:54.100 align:middle line:84%
where the baby boomers
hold the dream of Atlantis.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:54.900 align:middle line:90%
And there's--

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's us.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: That's us.

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:57.730 align:middle line:90%
We hold the dream.

00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:59.790 align:middle line:84%
The ones that are
called the X generations

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:02.470 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that are starting
to facilitate the dream.

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big
unfortunate things happened

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:06.730 align:middle line:90%
was the housing crisis in 2008.

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:09.070 align:middle line:84%
It took out that
whole generation

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:10.480 align:middle line:90%
in terms of their well being.

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And security
and stuff like that.

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: Security.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:16.750 align:middle line:84%
But the kids that are coming
in, the millennials and then

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.940 align:middle line:84%
the groupings
behind them, they're

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:23.050 align:middle line:84%
all the capacity to
make the Earth the way

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:25.600 align:middle line:84%
it is in well being,
in appropriateness,

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.790 align:middle line:90%
a new aspect of consciousness.

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You give webinars,
and you have people sign up

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.110 align:middle line:90%
for these webinars.

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:35.140 align:middle line:84%
What's the message
you'd like them to get?

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.670 align:middle line:10%
>>SELF: Know yourself.

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:38.450 align:middle line:10%
And here is the tools.

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:40.980 align:middle line:10%
Here's the pathway.

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't teach a truth.

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.840 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what truth is.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.570 align:middle line:10%
I know truth is what's
standing in front of me

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:49.120 align:middle line:10%
at the moment, which is
sometimes changeable.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.320 align:middle line:90%
But in this case, here's a tool.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:52.920 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Here's how you find the
center of your head.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Here's how you basically
reconfigure those chakras.

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Here's how you put
yourself back together.

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Most of our webinars are free.

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a course called
Mastering Alchemy.

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's about you
beginning to recognize

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:12.020 align:middle line:84%
you can step out
of the experience

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.940 align:middle line:90%
of that third dimensional game.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's all about you.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.357 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the external
world approving of you.

00:56:18.357 --> 00:56:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jim, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.315 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it.

00:56:21.315 --> 00:56:22.481 align:middle line:90%
>>SELF: My pleasure, George.

00:56:22.481 --> 00:56:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great advice
for people too, isn't it?

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SELF: Hopefully
if they can use it.

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:29.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Use it, and
just elevate yourself

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:32.020 align:middle line:10%
just a little bit more, and
you'll see your life change.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:32.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
