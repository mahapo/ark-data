seeking some of these people

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:90%
that we all know of?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:90%
How did you find them?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: Very unexpectedly
I got into this field.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Originally, I was
a martial athlete.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I
would do anything else.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:90%
But I had an illness.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:84%
That gave me time to
focus on other things.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I've been
fascinated since I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
was a child on this idea
advanced propulsion.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:84%
There may be extraterrestrial
life all around our Milky Way

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.007 align:middle line:84%
galaxy, but are
they coming here?

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:48.340 align:middle line:90%
And that was the pressing point.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
What would the
technology be if they

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:84%
could get from somewhere
far away to here?

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So I went directly
to the godfather

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
of conspiracy, the guy with
the most extraordinary beliefs

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:90%
That would have been John Lear.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:84%
He was really my
gateway drug, in a way,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:90%
to ufology and all that.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.649 align:middle line:84%
That's how I started, was
trying to earn his trust.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course, John

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.715 align:middle line:90%

>>CORBELL: William P.
Lear, yeah-- his father

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:90%
invented the 8-track stereo.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:90%
His company became Motorola.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:90%
He invented the Learjet.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.750 align:middle line:84%
John was a pilot, and he
has an extraordinary life

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.510 align:middle line:90%
in and of his own right.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.690 align:middle line:84%
But his father was also
an extraordinary man.

>>NOORY: Some of
the far out theories

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.114 align:middle line:90%
have come from John Lear.

00:02:35.114 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But I found that with
far out theories,

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
there's a reason and
a way that people

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.842 align:middle line:90%
come to those conclusions.

00:02:42.842 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, they're
sound and logical.

Sometimes they're not.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:84%

believe everything he says.

He likes to test
people, but he's

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:10%
come to those understandings

>>NOORY: Tell me about how
you conceived that program.

>>CORBELL: Well,
originally, I had

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.217 align:middle line:90%
to kind of earn John's trust.

00:03:48.217 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:90%
And that took about three years.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:90%

return a phone call from me.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what was
going on in his life.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.338 align:middle line:84%
But I figured if anybody to
go to-- because he seemed

00:03:57.338 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:84%
to be at the center of
the wildest theories

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
that we hear-- that I
needed to talk with him.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:10%
So I was calling him probably
three years before he actually

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:10%
called me back.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.300 align:middle line:10%

And so I went over to his
house, and it was the most

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:90%
awkward first few days ever.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:84%

single thing I said.

00:04:23.328 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:10%
And then over time--
I mean, six years now

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:10%
that I've been documenting
his daily life,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:10%

his perspective--

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:10%
I can say that we've
become friends.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't agree with
everything John says.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe all the
things because I don't have

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.302 align:middle line:90%
the evidence, but John does.

00:04:41.302 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:90%
He's come to his conclusions.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But John believes it.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: He does.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:10%
And there's reasons for that.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:10%
I've been in the room when
former intelligence officers,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:10%
people that worked
at Skunk Works

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:10%
have come and confessed to
him, at his table, at his desk.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's a reason why he
believes the things he does.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.300 align:middle line:84%
He's a fascinating human,
a fascinating individual.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do most
individuals believe him?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: It's
really hard to say.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
They're really
far-fetched things

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:84%
from a typical
standpoint of reality.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.074 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
things that John has

00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:90%
talked about-- I mean, look.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.240 align:middle line:84%
He is credited through your
colleague, George Knapp,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
for bringing Area 51
into the forefront

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:90%
through the Lazar stories.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:90%
So he has done some things.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
He even took photos
and leaked them

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
to Ned Day, who was a reporter
back then too, George's mentor,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.010 align:middle line:90%
about the stealth fighter.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So the first photos
we ever saw was

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.420 align:middle line:84%
because Lear was hanging out
at Area 51, shooting pictures.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And so we have the best photos
at lake level of Area 51

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:90%
we will ever see.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's thanks
to John in 1997.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.042 align:middle line:84%
So he's done some
incredible stuff.

00:05:46.042 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did you
break down your films,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.022 align:middle line:90%
into what categories?

00:05:49.022 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: Well, it's
difficult with John

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:84%
because it's spread so far
across the history of ufology.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:90%
He covers so many topics.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But what I try to do is,
first, get you to identify

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
with John so you can understand
who he is as a human being.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.691 align:middle line:84%
The humanity of the film is
more important than anything.

00:06:06.691 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm taking each
chunk, and I'm actually

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:90%
going kind of chronologically.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the introduction
where I was frustrated

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't have
evidence, to the point where

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:84%
he would reveal more
and more and more to me.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.219 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
some of the things

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that he has said to you
that are just astounding?

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: Well, you know, I
think his entire cosmology has

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:84%
changed because of
his exposure to people

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
like Bob Lazar who alleges
that he did work at S4,

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
a sub-base of Area
51-- back-engineering,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:84%
non-terrestrial, or
alien technology.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.930 align:middle line:84%
His whole worldview,
John's whole worldview,

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
although it does not
mesh with Bob's or other

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
people's-- but he's come to
a point in his life where he

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:84%
realizes that, as
he always says,

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.740 align:middle line:84%
it's our duty to live with
integrity and without envy,

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:90%
hate, or greed.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And he believes that
everything in our lives

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
is controlled by a
non-human intelligence that

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
then dictates to humanity
how we're going to evolve.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And if I summarize it,
that would be the belief

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.350 align:middle line:90%
that I gain from John.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeremy, did he ever
say that his father believed

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
in this, the creator
of the Lear jet?

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: Yeah, we
talked about that.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, in fact,
we've uncovered a little bit

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
that his father was involved
in some of the black project

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:84%
programs that most likely
dealt with non-terrestrial

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So he never expressly
said, I believe in UFOs.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not a belief.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:84%
It's either true
or it's not true.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or it's not true.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Right.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:84%
We either have craft of unknown
origin here, visiting Earth,

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.170 align:middle line:90%
or we don't.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:90%
But the idea is, which is it?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And so his father did
have a slight interest

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
because I think he was involved
in some of the black projects.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And actually, Dr.
Edgar Mitchell,

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.906 align:middle line:10%
who-- I did the last interview
with him before he passed away.

00:07:50.906 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm making a film
on him as well.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:10%
He was a good guy.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: An amazing
guy, just incredible.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And he knew William
P. Lear very well.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:90%
John didn't know that.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But astronaut Dr. Edgar
Mitchell did in fact

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:84%
know William P.
Lear, John's father.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mhm.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I will always remember
the story of John Lear

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:84%
on "Coast to Coast"
talking about how

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:90%
the moon was towed into place.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Do you address that at all?

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Yeah.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.292 align:middle line:84%
In my films, especially
on Lear, that

00:08:22.292 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
will come into play
at some point--

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:90%
his theories about the moon.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
He looks at the moon completely
differently than when you or I

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:90%
look and we see the moon.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:84%
He sees it as some
sort of station.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that,
obviously, I can't prove.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.309 align:middle line:10%
But sharing that with
people, his thoughts--

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's wild.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.788 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: --it's wild.

00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:10%
It's absolutely wild.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:10%
But he has other theories
that are not as extreme

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:10%
and things we can actually
document, like all

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:10%
his experiences with Lazar.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, doesn't he talk
about how the moon is a storage

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:90%
container for souls?

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:90%
He's done that before?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: Yeah, there
is a part about it

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
where he-- I think it
was Ingo Swann that

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:84%
did some remote
viewing and followed

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:90%
a soul as it left Earth.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is outside
of my scope of expertise,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:90%
but this is what John says.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And that when Ingo was following
this soul, that he was told,

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:84%
back off, back off, that there's
some receiver on the moon that

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.970 align:middle line:90%
collects the souls of humans.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.284 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is one of the
wildest theories John has.

00:09:23.284 --> 00:09:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It really is.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: It really is.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.541 align:middle line:84%
And we're never going to be able
to prove anything like that.

00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's outside of
my expertise and my filmmaking.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
That's not what I'm trying
to do, is prove or disprove

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of ideas.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I like to get my hands on things
that I can disrupt the status

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:90%
quo and prove something new.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's my focus.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Jeremy, you talked
about Bob Lazar from Area 51.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's get a better perspective
on the work you've done on him.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:10%
- He says he was hired
to work at an area called

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.850 align:middle line:10%
S4, which is a few miles
south of Groom Lake.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.660 align:middle line:84%
At S4, he says, are flying
saucers, anti-matter reactors,

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and other working examples of
technology that is seemingly

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:90%
beyond human capability.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:10%
- I know there are alien craft
here from another planet.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, I saw other ones,
but I was inside one.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I know it was not made on Earth.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I know it was made with
materials that we cannot

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:84%
fabricate, we cannot duplicate,
and we've never been able to.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I know it uses a
power source that's

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
so advanced that
we could only dream

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.170 align:middle line:90%
of something along those lines.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And the energy density
on it is phenomenal.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:84%
That's nothing that I
would ever expect to see.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.794 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeremy, that looks like
an exciting documentary there.

00:10:38.794 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Absolutely.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of happenstance
that Bob allowed

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:90%
me to film him a little bit.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Because at the time,
I didn't know him.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's
pretty standoffish.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.260 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: You know, again,
he wants his privacy.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.920 align:middle line:84%
He's telling you and me
the experience he had.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.409 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not we can grasp it
or wrap our minds around it,

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
he's just telling you
what happened to him.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:90%
He can't prove it.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:84%
There are ways he could
prove it, but he's not.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't want the attention.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.580 align:middle line:84%
It gets in the way of
the government contracts

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
he has now, of the
science he's doing now.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So he really just
wants, here's my story.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Take it or leave it.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:84%
If you don't believe
it, pass it on.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.059 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't want the attention.

00:11:21.059 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He doesn't care.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.516 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: He
doesn't care, and it

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.410 align:middle line:84%
gets in the way of
his personal life.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:84%
But I no longer have
the luxury of disbelief

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:90%
after knowing Bob for some time.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.662 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
kind of moment that

00:11:31.662 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:90%
raises the hair on your arms.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you know
that something is real,

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and before you were
questioning-- I questioned it

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.395 align:middle line:90%
like you, like everybody else.

00:11:39.395 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Right.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:90%
It's an extraordinary claim.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But I've come to
the understanding

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and I do not have the
luxury of disbelief

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:84%
anymore when it
comes to Bob's story.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.255 align:middle line:84%
He's telling the truth, whether
we can accept that or not.

00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about some of those

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
claims that he makes
about Area 51--

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.630 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial beings,
craft that he said he saw.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Tell us more.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: Yeah, so
Bob Lazar worked at S4.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a sub-base of Area 51.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:90%
We know that it exists now.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.175 align:middle line:84%
In 1999, your
colleague, George Knapp,

00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:12.739 align:middle line:84%
called the Public
Affairs Office.

00:12:12.739 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:90%
And they admitted to him.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:90%
They have multiple S4s.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:84%
No one had ever heard about
that before, before Bob Lazar.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So then recently,
we called again

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.783 align:middle line:84%
and tried to get
them to reconfirm it,

00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and they give us the
most hilarious answer.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:10%
They said-- they took a
whole day and got back to us.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.552 align:middle line:10%
And they said, well, you know--

00:12:28.552 --> 00:12:30.218 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They didn't
know how to say it.

00:12:30.218 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: Yeah, they said,
we don't have an S4 designated

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:10%
on any of our official maps.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.164 align:middle line:10%
That's their new answer,
when 1989, they already--

00:12:37.164 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They
already admitted it.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.746 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: --admitted to it.

00:12:39.746 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And you know, George has been
a mentor to me in journalism

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:84%
because he's walked
this path for so long.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And you run into a lot of BS.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And you really have
to sift through it.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
With Lazar, everything
has checked out.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
The further I go,
the more that I see

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:90%
that Bob is telling the truth.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And I actually broke a
big part of the story.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:90%
I did an interview.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:90%
I call it the Krangle interview.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I found an employee
at Los Alamos

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
who confirmed beyond
a shadow of a doubt

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that Lazar was working
there as a physicist,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.390 align:middle line:90%
not like some people claimed.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:10%
Maybe he was a janitor, this
or that-- no, as a physicist.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: Yeah,
it was incredible.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So 25 years of this
kind of debate,

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and we were able to just
get in there, prove it.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And now we can move forward
with the bigger question.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
The biggest question
is, how did he know?

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:84%
How did he know,
over Papoose Lake,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that a disk was
going to come up,

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and he could show
all his friends?

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:84%
You only know that if
you have the information

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:90%
from the inside.

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:42.390 align:middle line:10%
That's the proof.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk--

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What if
he was an insider?

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.233 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: He was
an insider, in fact.

00:13:45.233 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:10%
And he was as perplexed by
the technology as anybody

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:10%
because it was so far advanced,
even in the material science,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:10%
that on Earth, we do not
have the ability to create

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:10%
things of this magnitude.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.772 align:middle line:84%
The element 115, that
was incredible too.

00:14:02.772 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
People have a huge
debate about it.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.840 align:middle line:84%
They totally misunderstand
the nature of the element.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So two things, modern day, that
have occurred in the last six

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
One, we now know that
gravity is a wave.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.840 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's the premise--

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we found that.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.561 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: We found that.

00:14:18.561 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
It only took a supernova,
but Bob knew that

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:84%
from dealing with a
stabilized element

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
115 where the
isotope used inside

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:84%
of that 115 allowed
it to be stabilized

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
for more than like
part of a millisecond.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:90%
So we know that.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Gravity is a wave, and
waves can be amplified.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we
know now thanks to Bob,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:84%
element 115 was
synthesized on Earth.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it was unstable.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But one day, they will find the
isotope, the correct isotope,

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:48.570 align:middle line:90%
to stabilize it.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And he'll be right.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.880 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: He's
right on many levels.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.940 align:middle line:10%
But the big question is, how
did we get 500 pounds of it?

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And it would take another
supernova, not the one

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:90%
that created our solar system.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
So it was cargo.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:90%
It was brought here.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:10%
And that is fascinating to have
that much stabilized element

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:10%
115, which, by the way,
they milled at Los Alamos

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.937 align:middle line:10%
under the name LA 1000.

00:15:12.937 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And we're lucky
enough to have it, right?

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: Well, we
aren't, unfortunately,

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.462 align:middle line:10%
but our government or a
faction within our government.

00:15:22.462 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I still say "we" when
I talk about our government.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.086 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:26.086 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, absolutely.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:84%
But to be clear, I don't
got it in my pocket.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.320 align:middle line:84%
That would be proof
positive, you know?

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: But it's
a fascinating story.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And Bob is a consistent guy, and
he has told us what he knows.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.252 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us to either
believe, not believe,

00:15:43.252 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:90%
or look into it deeper.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has he benefited
if he's not telling the truth?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Yeah.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's he
getting out of this?

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: It has done
nothing good for him.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he has--

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's not making
any money on it, is he?

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: No.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
The only thing he wants to
do is just get his words out

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:90%
without them being distorted.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:10%
And that's been the
problem all this time.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:10%
People distort his words.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:90%
They distort his story.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:90%
He just wants a clear version.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.660 align:middle line:90%
You've got the information.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:90%
Do with it what you will.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:84%
At first, it was
self-preservation.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:90%
That's why he came forward.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.630 align:middle line:90%
His life was in chaos.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.140 align:middle line:90%
He was being threatened.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And I have been able to
validate a lot of that.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.132 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm stepping in
a second tier person.

00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:84%
The people that originally
worked on this, of course,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.990 align:middle line:84%
was George Knapp and his
best friend, Gene Huff.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
But coming in from
a new perspective,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.996 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that I can help add
to the dialogue with this film.

00:16:34.996 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and
George believes him.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
George believes the
Bob Lazar stories.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:90%
He believes the John Lear story.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Well, I don't know.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:10%
Nobody believes all of the
things John says except John.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:10%
But with Bob Lazar, George
has done his due diligence.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:90%
And there's things he can prove.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:84%
In his first episode that
he ever aired, he says,

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I cannot prove certain
things about Lazar's story,

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:90%
but here's what I know.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.031 align:middle line:90%
And he has been tenacious.

00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a matter
of belief for George.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have the
luxury of disbelief

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
is a better way to
say it, because he

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:90%
has seen the evidence.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:84%
He has been through that
weird time with Bob.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm really grateful.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm really grateful that
this story has come out,

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:84%
because that's what originally
weaponized my curiosity,

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:19.240 align:middle line:84%
was hearing the
propulsion system when I

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:90%
was 13 years old on the radio.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And now looking at it
from the lens that I have,

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.362 align:middle line:84%
it is one of the most
fascinating stories to date.

00:17:27.362 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the fact that
he said he has seen the craft.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: He's
been inside of one.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:10%
He was allowed to go inside.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:10%
And the funniest thing
he said-- and all of this

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:10%
is public information--
I asked him

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:10%
one time, what did it feel like
to go inside of this craft that

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle line:10%
was obviously, from your
understanding, not made here?

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you know, a
lot of people ask that,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and they think it'd
be exhilarating.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:90%
He said, it was ominous.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Everything was too small.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Indeed.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Yeah.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Indeed.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.563 align:middle line:84%
What is it about Lazar's
story that fascinates you

00:17:58.563 --> 00:17:59.370 align:middle line:90%
the most, Jeremy?

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: It's got to
be the propulsion system.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be the concept
of having a power source that

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
is so contained that there's
no radiation effect off

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:90%
of it with heat and all this.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect system that
then can amplify gravity waves.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you can amplify gravity
waves, then essentially,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.640 align:middle line:90%
you can distort time space.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:90%
So you're not flying anywhere.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
You're falling into place, or
it's stretching into place.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredible
concept that does not

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.220 align:middle line:90%
defy our known laws of physics.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.962 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have the material
science or the elements--

00:18:35.962 --> 00:18:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're not there yet.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: Yeah,
we're not there yet--

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years, maybe.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:90%
We're not there yet.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But if we do have
this technology,

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.490 align:middle line:90%
the implications are vast.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
exciting thing.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.207 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can you
tell me about Nano Man?

00:18:52.207 --> 00:18:53.290 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: Nano Man, yeah.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:10%
So I--

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: A great name.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.420 align:middle line:10%
It's like a superhero--

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It sounds like
a cartoon character.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: Yeah, it's
like a superhero name.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:10%
I did that because at
first, he was kind of part

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.460 align:middle line:10%
of the invisible college.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.480 align:middle line:84%
He was a scientist
who would help

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
me look at really
anomalous stuff

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:84%
but didn't want to be in
the forefront of anything.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
His name is Chris
Cooper, and he's

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
a nanophysicist who works on
the bleeding edge of technology.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.000 align:middle line:10%
And he works on
everything-- and how

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:10%
I started with him was working
through military contacts

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:10%
of mine who brought
me to him and said,

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:10%
he is working on a
propulsion system,

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:10%
and it's fascinating,
the way that it works.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And essentially what it is,
it's like a paddle wheel.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:84%
He uses brand new
metamaterials, like materials

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that humans have just
been able to create.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
They're atomic-perfect
layered-- for example, graphene.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a new development in
our history of humanity--

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, strong material.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: The
strongest on the planet.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And so the deal is, is that
with these metamaterials,

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:84%
there's different
reactions that occur

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.490 align:middle line:84%
in our natural environment
than know the other materials

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:90%
that we've used.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.532 align:middle line:84%
So utilizing that,
these strange reactions

00:19:57.532 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
you get out of
these metamaterials,

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
he basically created
a paddle wheel.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And by amping up and moving
it, it is creating a force,

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:90%
allegedly.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.687 align:middle line:84%
He's still in the R&D
phases, but enough

00:20:07.687 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
where there's military
individuals who

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
asked me to document it,
who are interested in this.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's
pushing against something,

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:90%
and it's propelling forward.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:90%
But there's no access.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.710 align:middle line:90%
So there is no back push on it.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So they don't know where
it's deriving its force from,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:90%
what it's pushing against.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know where
the Newtonian law, where

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
the equal and opposite
force, is going.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:90%
The theories are incredible.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that with the metal
materials being atomically

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.830 align:middle line:84%
layered perfectly, almost
perfectly to three degrees,

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:84%
they're essentially
pushing the backsplash

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:90%
into another dimension.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why we can't
measure it here.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's wild, and
I have no idea.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:10%
If he's successful in
this endeavor with a space

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.470 align:middle line:10%
drive, which is the first thing
that I started documenting

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:10%
with him, it's a game-changer.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's fascinating.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: It is
fascinating, yeah.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But there's many other
things that Nano Man

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:84%
is doing that I kind
fell into understanding.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea we
were going to get

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.700 align:middle line:84%
so wild with what I
started documenting on him

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:90%
after this propulsion device.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:90%
And it got strange.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:10%
He's a highly intelligent,
motivated, connected individual

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:10%
who's done a lot of
work for the government,

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:10%
has focused on propulsion
as his main thing.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And I started to get a hint
that there were some reason why

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.810 align:middle line:84%
he was driven and motivated
to basically make us

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials,
to make us

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials
in the sense of getting

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:90%
us moving through space.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And then he makes
that a mission to me.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm one of the only
nanotechnologists on the planet

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:84%
probably who knows for a fact
that the extraterrestrial

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
technology is real, and
that that's a highly

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:90%
motivating factor for me.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:90%
And I said, hold up.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS]

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: Let me
cut the cameras.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:10%
What are you talking about?

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to come document
your propulsion device.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.250 align:middle line:10%
What do you mean you know the
extraterrestrial technology is

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.200 align:middle line:10%
real?

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So from his understanding
that it is real--

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's his personal
information, OK?

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Has he been
reverse-engineering stuff?

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: His
personal information

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:90%
is his personal information.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
But basically, he is
confident that other cultures

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.330 align:middle line:84%
have created the
technologies that allow them

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:90%
to travel amongst the stars.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So why can't we move
that needle forward?

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.420 align:middle line:90%
So that's what he's working on.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And when he said that
extraterrestrial thing, that

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:84%
really brought more
into the filming

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
with him, because it opened
up doors to other research

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:84%
he's been doing that he never
wanted to talk about on film.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jeremy, whatever that
stuff is, it excites Nano Man.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: It does.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:10%
And it was highly
motivating to him

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:10%
as a nanophysicist and a guy
that works on nanotechnology

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:10%
to find a substance that seemed
to defy all logic of what

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:10%
we can create.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
controversial story,

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have
conclusions yet.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But I was able to
get access to NASA

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:84%
for an entire day on a
scanning electron microscope.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I thought
he was pulling my leg.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.040 align:middle line:90%
I didn't--

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.623 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
he do that, though?

00:23:06.623 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: I don't know,
but that's the thing.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.487 align:middle line:84%
I need to assume until
I see it for myself.

00:23:12.487 --> 00:23:13.320 align:middle line:90%
And I told him that.

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.732 align:middle line:84%
I said, well,
that's fascinating.

00:23:14.732 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Where did you get this?

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's got like
128 different samples

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:84%
from high activity
sites, UFO landing sites.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:84%
He's silently collected a
whole bunch of materials,

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:24.160 align:middle line:90%
like residues.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And he says, look, here are some
scanning electron microscope

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:90%
images from 10 years ago.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is what it
looks like to me.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:90%
This is what I see.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.740 align:middle line:84%
I see nanotechnology
as a nanophysicist.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.496 align:middle line:84%
But he's like, you
go look for yourself.

00:23:38.496 --> 00:23:40.245 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, how
am I going to do that?

00:23:40.245 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:10%
He's like, well, I
can get you to NASA.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.010 align:middle line:10%
Excuse me?

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.445 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: Yeah, NASA Ames?

00:23:44.445 --> 00:23:45.425 align:middle line:10%
I was like, go ahead.

00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:10%
If they'd let a tattooed
guy with a beard come in

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:10%
and use their
microscope, I'm down.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.830 align:middle line:10%
Let's do it, you know?

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Sure enough, I get a call.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And I spend an entire
day with a technician

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:90%
looking at this material.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.668 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: They were baffled.

00:23:58.668 --> 00:24:01.080 align:middle line:10%
They don't know how
this stuff was created.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:10%
They said, one day, we
will be able to create

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.965 align:middle line:10%
something like this through
like atomic printing.

00:24:05.965 --> 00:24:07.131 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So do they ask him?

00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Where did you get this?

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: No, because I
didn't tell them anything.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:11.970 align:middle line:90%
I just said, I have a substance.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to do elemental
analysis on it.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I want to do scanning
electron microscopy.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to get an idea of
what it is we're seeing.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:90%
It's an alloy.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
even have an idea?

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: All they
know is that this

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.990 align:middle line:84%
is something that
was fabricated,

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.310 align:middle line:90%
that it is an alloy.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:10%
But it is--

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: When you say
"fabricated," you mean created.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.298 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: It was made.

00:24:30.298 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:10%
It was made, yeah.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.737 align:middle line:90%
And we can't--

00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not hoaxed.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: No,
it's not a hoaxed.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I took it there.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:90%
It looks like water.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's an ethanol.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is they--
you can see in my film.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.439 align:middle line:84%
The technician, he puts
his hand on his head and--

00:24:46.439 --> 00:24:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're baffled.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: He says, we don't
have the ability right now

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:90%
to make this.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:84%
The diameter of
the uniform holes

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:84%
in each of the tiny
little particulates,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:84%
we can't even do that
with atomic milling.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that defies
our known material science.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, what it is,
I'm not jumping--

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: I'm not
jumping to conclusions.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.480 align:middle line:10%
There's got to be more
and more tests on it.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is not
going to prove much.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:84%
But what it will do
is show us that there

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:84%
is an anomalous material
of unknown origin,

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.256 align:middle line:84%
and it's far beyond
what we can do now.

00:25:23.256 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:90%
And that would be exciting.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.713 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what's so great
about your documentaries,

00:25:26.713 --> 00:25:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Jeremy, is that you
record them, you

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.110 align:middle line:84%
allow us to look at them,
you invite us in to see it.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:84%
You've got one and a
program on somebody

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:84%
who is very dear to our
hearts, Dr. Roger Leir.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Yes.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We lost Dr. Leir.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.397 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Leir, when I first
came to Los Angeles,

00:25:42.397 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:84%
called me up one day
and said, George,

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I want you to witness me taking
an object out of a woman.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.536 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
it is, but we're

00:25:50.536 --> 00:25:51.660 align:middle line:90%
going to go in and operate.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.572 align:middle line:84%
So along with the surgeon,
they're videotaping.

00:25:54.572 --> 00:25:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And Tom Danheiser,
my producer, and I

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:84%
are witnessing an object
in a woman's cheek.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:10%
And when I was on
radio talking about it,

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:10%
I had to emphasize cheek-cheek
as opposed to her other cheek.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:09.790 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: [LAUGHS] Either way.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But we would
look at this object.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:10%
And they opened her
up, and they go in

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:10%
to grab it with the tweezers.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:90%
It would move.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.615 align:middle line:90%
It would run away from her.

00:26:18.615 --> 00:26:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: I've heard
of that, I think.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.115 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then they
finally got the thing out.

00:26:22.115 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, Roger,
prior to him dying,

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
was never able to
decipher what it was.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:10%
In my years of knowing
Roger Leir, I trusted him.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:32.810 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: Yeah.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I believed him.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.200 align:middle line:84%
He had very little
financial gain in this.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:84%
He devoted-- he was a
podiatrist-- devoted

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:84%
his career to trying to find out
what the heck these things are.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: Yeah, and I highly
respected him for that.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was through my business
partner, Reuben Langdon,

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
who's kind of the unsung
hero of this Citizen Hearing

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.640 align:middle line:84%
as a producer, he
brought me to Roger.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And Roger says, Jeremy,
I've seen your filmmaking.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I really want you
to document this.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: I said, Roger, look,
I'm going to tell the truth.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Are you sure you want me to?

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Jeremy, I've been
doing this for over 25 years.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.026 align:middle line:90%
I know there's something to it.

00:27:11.026 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I want somebody to
really look at this.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:90%
And I said, great.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:10%
And then we have the twist,
which is Dr. Leir passes away.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:10%
So I had this great opportunity
to document his final alleged

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.757 align:middle line:10%
alien implant removal surgery.

00:27:23.757 --> 00:27:25.882 align:middle line:84%
So I got to go and see the
whole surgery, like you.

00:27:25.882 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: It was remarkable.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing was
emitting a frequency

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.510 align:middle line:84%
before it was taken
outside of the body.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes through the
experience of Patient 17.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.670 align:middle line:84%
When Dr. Leir passed
away, though, it

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:90%
threw a monkey wrench.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Nobody was doing the science.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:40.490 align:middle line:90%
There was this part.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:43.530 align:middle line:10%
And I said, OK, well, I
have to take this on now.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:10%
So I did broad spectrum
elemental analysis

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.755 align:middle line:10%
on Object 17.

00:27:47.755 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You did this?

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:49.645 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: I did--
well, I had it

00:27:49.645 --> 00:27:52.890 align:middle line:10%
done at Northern Analytics,
a great, reputable lab.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And they found more
than 36 elements

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%
within this tiny
little piece of metal.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So all these elements,
playing nicely together

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:84%
in this tiny little piece,
that's kind of interesting.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Some were rare Earth elements.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a fabricated
piece of material.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
work, Jeremy.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: It wasn't just
like a nail or something.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, here's
the craziest part.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I had isotopic
analysis done on it.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Specifically the one that
jumped out was zinc, zinc-64.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.940 align:middle line:84%
There are four types of zinc
that you can really test for.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.320 align:middle line:84%
If anything is outside 1%
of the terrestrial norm--

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.860 align:middle line:84%
you can look it up anywhere in
scientific journals-- that's

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.660 align:middle line:90%
astounding.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:84%
That means it was made in
possibly another supernova--

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:90%
again, cargo.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
The zinc-64 in this piece,
in Patient 17's piece,

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
even with a ratio
of error of 1.25,

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:52.037 align:middle line:84%
was over 1.24% outside of
the terrestrial ratios.

00:28:52.037 --> 00:28:54.120 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which you don't
find here on this planet.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.578 align:middle line:10%
>>CORBELL: You
cannot find it here.

00:28:55.578 --> 00:28:59.080 align:middle line:10%
It was literally fabricated most
likely in another supernova.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:28:59.880 align:middle line:10%
Now--

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They're tracking
devices, I think.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: It's possible.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.400 align:middle line:90%
But here's the deal.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm unconvinced until
I find direct evidence

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:90%
that we can replicate.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:84%
I only got to do
that study one time.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:84%
I have not had access
to the parts either.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:84%
You can get
contamination sometimes

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:17.560 align:middle line:84%
when you do these results,
although I called the lab.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.220 align:middle line:90%
They stand by their results.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.560 align:middle line:90%
They don't imply what it is.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.610 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to do three
more double-blind experiments

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:90%
with it at different labs.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.110 align:middle line:90%
One day, I hope to do that--

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you still
have the material?

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: See, I don't
have access to it.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.095 align:middle line:84%
Since he passed away,
there's been real issues

00:29:34.095 --> 00:29:34.970 align:middle line:90%
with getting a hold--

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.929 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody knows
who's doing what anymore.

00:29:36.929 --> 00:29:37.728 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: Right.

00:29:37.728 --> 00:29:39.520 align:middle line:10%
And people are not
highly motivated, maybe.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.570 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I fought to be able to
do these experiments after Dr.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.400 align:middle line:10%
Leir passed away, but at
least I got one experiment in.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So it raises the
question, can we do more?

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- I don't think we'll
ever know the truth through

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:54.440 align:middle line:90%
these alleged implants.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We need more Dr. Leirs.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CORBELL: We do.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:84%
We need people that are willing
to put themselves forward, put

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:84%
themselves on the line, and
try to discover the truth.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:03.955 align:middle line:90%
And that's my agenda.

00:30:03.955 --> 00:30:04.755 align:middle line:10%
My agenda--

00:30:04.755 --> 00:30:06.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, as you look
at all of this, Jeremy,

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:12.380 align:middle line:10%
the documentary on John Lear,
the documentary on Roger Leir,

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:10%
the documentary on Bob Lazar,
what does this picture look

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.800 align:middle line:10%
like now to you?

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CORBELL: The
conclusion I've come to

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:84%
is there seems to be a non-human
intelligence that is somehow

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:90%
interacting with humanity.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's doing so in
multiple ways-- everything

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.540 align:middle line:84%
from technologically, to
the stovepipe of technology

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.450 align:middle line:84%
that our military
is interested in,

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:38.930 align:middle line:90%
to even poltergeist activity.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:84%
A good example is the
events of Skinwalker Ranch.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Big picture-- there is a
non-human intelligence engaging

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:46.830 align:middle line:90%
humanity.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:90%
The question is, why?

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:90%
What is it for?

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.550 align:middle line:10%
Is it malevolent?

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:10%
Is it benevolent?

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.170 align:middle line:10%
And that's the big question.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.100 align:middle line:10%
And the closer we
can get to the truth,

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.580 align:middle line:10%
the more we learn about reality
and ourselves as humans.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's the goal.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:04.390 align:middle line:10%
If they view the work, I really
hope that their curiosity will

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:05.747 align:middle line:10%
be weaponized, as has mine.

00:31:05.747 --> 00:31:07.205 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, you
did a great job.
