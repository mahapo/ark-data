>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.660 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.432 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:13.090 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.015 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:19.095 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, we can
all use extra brain power.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory with
our special guest,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Coach Bob, Bob Glotzhober.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Bob has been a Real Life Change
Coach for a number of years.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:90%
And what does that exactly mean?

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:90%
He's changing your life.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:90%
He's changing your business.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:84%
He's changing your
approach to how

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:84%
you've seen things in the past
so you could look at things

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.070 align:middle line:90%
differently in the future.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to "Beyond
Belief," Coach Bob.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:90%
Always a pleasure.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BOB GLOTZHOBER: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.909 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's always
fun to chat with you,

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:10%
because I've known you for so
many years in Detroit, Detroit

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.910 align:middle line:10%
being the old hometown.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
It's been fun watching you
change and progress and go

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
through this evolution,
too, isn't it?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Yes, yes,
you've had a firsthand view

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:90%
of what I've gone through.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And like you say, the
experiences we have change us.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:10%
And our brain can
allow us to determine

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:10%
the experiences we have.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a lot more
control than we think.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.971 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've gone
from an average golfer

00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:90%
to a good golfer, haven't you?

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.406 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: It's amazing.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:10%
I had my lowest handicap
this year of my whole life,

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:10%
and I'm 65.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty wild.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.785 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, does a program like
this, the Real Change program,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.990 align:middle line:84%
does that help people lower
your golf score, better

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:84%
your relationship,
get a better job?

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:10%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Yes, it does.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.400 align:middle line:10%
A friend of mine
was always perplexed

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:10%
trying to figure out what I do.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Bob,
he says, what you do

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:90%
is the thing before the thing.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And what he meant is that no
matter what we're dealing with,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:84%
our attitude, our emotions,
our state of mind when

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:84%
we take something on is going to
determine how we move forward.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.420 align:middle line:90%
I refer to it as mood matters.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:84%
If I'm angry or if
I'm fearful, I'm

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
going to make different
decisions than if I'm calm.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever
you're dealing with,

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:84%
it's so much easier to calm
down and let your brain be

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
the best it can be than to try
to memorize 12 steps to try

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:90%
to do something different.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In our previous
"Beyond Belief" program, Bob,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
we talked about energy
and people's ability

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
to tap into this universal
force that's out there.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's concentrate on
this program about what

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:90%
you call the magic of the mind.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.352 align:middle line:84%
And how important is the
mind to creating this change?

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Right, and
that's really the first step

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:90%
of changing your energy.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It's your brain that's
going to change your energy.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it's understanding
how it works.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically a
three-step process.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Our brain takes in, our
senses take in information,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
whether we hear something,
we taste something,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:90%
we see something.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, our brain is so
sophisticated it immediately

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:84%
gives us an emotion of whether
to approach or avoid, fight

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:90%
or flee.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And then our cognitive
part of our brain

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.760 align:middle line:84%
thinks about, OK, what's
the best way in which

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:90%
to follow those instructions?

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
we're put together.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And so understanding
that process is critical

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:84%
if you really want to change
the way you do things.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we tapping
into a subconscious?

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something
physical in the brain?

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: We
don't really know.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The holy grail of
neuroscience is

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure
out, does the brain

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.940 align:middle line:84%
or how does the brain
create the mind?

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.692 align:middle line:84%
And so that's still
a wide-open question.

00:04:03.692 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: My personal belief
is that they're definitely

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:90%
connected.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn to use what
you're conscious of, which

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
is the way my brain
gives me emotions,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.450 align:middle line:84%
the way my brain
gives me thoughts,

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I then can use that
to be able to then tap

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:84%
into my unconscious so that I
can be directed automatically

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:84%
in the ways that I
choose to want to go,

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily the way my
ancestral brain wants me to go.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Real doctors
and scientists

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
will say it's always
the brain, it's

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.920 align:middle line:84%
the physical brain
that does everything.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Meta-physicians, on the
other hand, would say,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
no, it's the subconscious
mind, it's the conscious mind.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.632 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the two of them
just work together.

00:04:52.632 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: It's a
guess at this point,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:84%
but I think they
definitely work together.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're a
scientist, and this

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
is why sometimes science, I have
a little bit of a tough time

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
with it, although I
really get into science,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
is that everything we've
learned as scientists,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:90%
we find out is not true.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Copernicus found out
that the Earth is

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:90%
at the center of the universe.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Newton found out about gravity.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Einstein proved Newton's
laws a little wrong.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So science is constantly
finding out that they're wrong.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't think we should
marry ourselves to any belief.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's pretty
obvious right now that we

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.720 align:middle line:84%
can use our brain to
control our emotions, which

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%
in fact controls our lives.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think they are
hooked together.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Speaking of
emotions, how many times

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
have we witnessed, for example,
in a store a mother slapping

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
their little baby
because they're screaming

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:84%
or someone under tension
who just loses it?

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people under
extreme conditions

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:90%
just fall apart, just crumble.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I happen to be one
of those people, Bob,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that during a moment of
strife, I get stronger.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't panic.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't run around with my
head cut off, going, oh,

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.300 align:middle line:90%
my God, what's going to happen?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I react quickly and fast
to just about any episode,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
grandchild who falls

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and you might need to get them
into a hospital or something.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Panicking doesn't do anything.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
How do you control
those kinds of emotions

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.240 align:middle line:84%
so that you can control
the direction of your life?

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: OK, it
starts with understanding

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:90%
how your brain's operating.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is the
information that you have

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.760 align:middle line:84%
up in your brain consists
of two things, the DNA

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:90%
that you got from your parents--

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you're stuck with.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And
you're stuck with it.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good or bad.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Good or
bad-- most of it's good.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.868 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't have to
learn how to beat our hearts

00:06:55.868 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:84%
or how to breathe
or any of that.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:84%
All that information is
given to us, which is good.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:84%
On top of that,
what's up in here

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.730 align:middle line:84%
is our memories
from this lifetime.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So any time you're
going to do something,

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:84%
your brain immediately checks
its DNA and your past memories

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and spits out to you
the most appropriate way

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
for you to respond based
on the information it has.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So people that act like
you and can respond

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
under pressure, for some
reason in your memory bank

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and in your DNA, your brain
knows that your calm emotions

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:90%
are in your best interest.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:84%
If that's not how you're
wired, if in fact you're

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:50.210 align:middle line:84%
wired that your brain says,
it's all about survival,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
my life's been very
dangerous, I've

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.820 align:middle line:84%
had to fight or flee to
keep from being whacked,

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
well then when you're
under pressure,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
run away or you're

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:90%
going to be argumentative.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:84%
You can really see
this in the workplace.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at all
your coworkers.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
You'll see some of them,
when there's pressure,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
are going to fight
and get aggressive.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Some aren't going to show
up for work because they're

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:84%
so afraid because the job is
not going the way it should be

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:90%
and they feel responsible.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing to
do for change is to see,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:90%
how is my brain wired?

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:90%
What are my tendencies?

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:84%
And once you see that
the tendency to be calm

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
is so much better than your
tendency to fight or flee,

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.880 align:middle line:90%
now you have a chance.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Because your brain
wants to survive.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
convince your brain

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that being calm in
pressure situations

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:84%
will make it survive
better, which it will,

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
it will buy in, that's
why we can change.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
experience, how many people

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.570 align:middle line:84%
actually want to be able
to control these emotions,

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
to control the
ability of the mind

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:84%
to be calm in these
incredible situations?

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Or do they just not care?

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: That's a question
that's been perplexing me

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:90%
since I started coaching.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Why, when I was 40, did I
finally choose to be different?

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Why do people choose
to find a coach?

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Or why do people choose
to pick up a book

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:84%
or take a training
course because now

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:84%
is the time for them
to be different?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that's
hanging out there that we still

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:90%
can't get our mitts on.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And I keep thinking about that,
because, boy, I would really

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
like to have some
type of technique

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
to make people be
more motivated.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Because once you're
motivated, you can do it.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But why people aren't motivated,
that's still a mystery to us.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Social
networking, which

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
is, I think,
revolutionizing and changing

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:84%
the face of this planet, has
its good moments and its bad.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the bad is
people are subjected

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:84%
to cyber bullying
and things like that,

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:84%
to the point where some
children have committed suicide

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
because others
attack them socially.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
How do you fight
something like that?

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.244 align:middle line:84%
How do you look at some
things-- maybe you're online,

00:10:26.244 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
attacked from people.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Facebook for example,
somebody will post a picture,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see
people rip them up.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they try to
fight back, and I'm

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
looking at this, going, don't
even get involved with that.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:90%
It's petty.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Move on.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But it pulls down
their entire life.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:90%
It effects them.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:90%
It ruins their day.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.330 align:middle line:90%
How do you step above that?

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: I
think somehow we have

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
to communicate through
our government,

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:84%
through our schools,
maybe in the home.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the place to start is for
us to teach our young to say,

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:84%
do we want more
peaceful and more joyful

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:90%
energy in the world?

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Or do we want more negative
and more angry and more fearful

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:90%
energy in the world?

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:90%
We're not asking that question.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But when we're
asked that question,

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:84%
we're going to choose
more peaceful and joyful,

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
we want for ourselves.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
on social network,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
just like we talked about
in the last episode,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:90%
we talked about road rage.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:84%
It's no different in
social networking.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Somebody says something
that makes you mad.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:90%
You want to slam right back.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:84%
If you can just take
a step back and say,

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.730 align:middle line:84%
am I'm going to be better
off if I put better energy

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:84%
into the world or more negative
energy, that's the message we

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.510 align:middle line:90%
need to get across.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were talking about
some techniques of how people

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:90%
can help change their approach.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
things people can do?

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: OK, the
first thing they can do

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:84%
is spend the time to get
to know how they operate.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize that what
you're thinking right now

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and what you're
feeling right now

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:84%
is because you're
a biological robot,

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:84%
you think what you are
thinking right now because

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:84%
of your DNA and
your past memories,

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:90%
that's all you have to draw on.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But you also have a new
part of your brain, which

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.830 align:middle line:84%
is your cognitive
brain that's pushing up

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
against your forehead that
can sit back and say, now wait

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:84%
a minute, this is
what I'm feeling

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:90%
because of what I've come from.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Do I really want to go
there with this right now?

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Or do I want to take a
step back and maybe change

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
the energy I'm going
to give the situation?

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the way you
go about changing.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:84%
It starts with first
understanding how you operate,

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:84%
second being able to
let your conscious mind

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
observe who you are
right now instead of just

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:90%
being that biological robot.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Like playing monopoly, you've
got a Get out of Jail Free card

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:84%
You can get out of
that biological prison

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and make different choices,
which will change your life.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Coach
Bob, Real Change--

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
when people come to you, what
are they generally coming

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:90%
to you for?

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:84%
They obviously know
they need some help.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Yes, and this
is kind of another catch-22.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.511 align:middle line:84%
People come to me because
they have an issue.

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:90%
I wish they would come to me--

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you're
not a psychiatrist, right?

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.002 align:middle line:90%
You're not a medical doctor.

00:13:37.002 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: No.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You deal with the mind,
but you're not into medicine.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:90%
You don't prescribe.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't put them on
mood-altering drugs.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't like to be
called a psychotherapist.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.782 align:middle line:84%
So when they come to you, I
mean, what are they asking for?

00:13:52.782 --> 00:13:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: What
they're doing is

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:84%
they've tried all those other
remedies, and it hasn't worked.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they find me because
they've got a problem that they

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to get over.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they find me.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the good
thing is that they're here.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:84%
But I wish people would take
the time to prepare themselves

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
for the bad news
that's coming so

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:84%
that when the bad news
comes, they can handle it.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.849 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier
to do it that way.

00:14:20.849 --> 00:14:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It's like in health care.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Prevention is a lot better
than getting a disease

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and then having to
deal with it then.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:84%
But to answer your
question, when

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:84%
they come to me with
problems, they'll never

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:90%
admit right away what it is.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:84%
For example, a businessman
may be coming to me

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and he may be saying, I've
got cash flow problems,

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:90%
I've got some shortage.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:90%
But the more you get into it--

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.521 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's coming to
you for a loan, isn't he?

00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:47.762 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: But
then it branches.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And you find out that the
negative energy running through

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and the angst that he has is
happening in his household.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:84%
He's got problems maybe with
his spouse or with his children.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And so generally when
people come to me,

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I pretty much know that what
they're coming to me for

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.970 align:middle line:90%
isn't the real issue.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it's generally
something very personal, and so

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:84%
it takes a while for
me to get to know them

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.710 align:middle line:84%
in individual
coaching situations

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:18.010 align:middle line:84%
before I really understand
what they are asking me for.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
is it for a child

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.480 align:middle line:84%
to be raised in this
loving environment?

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.230 align:middle line:90%
I was very fortunate.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.910 align:middle line:84%
My sisters were very
fortunate that we

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:31.550 align:middle line:84%
have and had two
loving parents who

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:84%
cared about us, who
were involved in what

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.830 align:middle line:84%
we did career-wise,
who were involved

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:90%
in what we did emotionally.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.139 align:middle line:84%
And they always
seemed to be there.

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And I think that was important.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that was one of
the reasons why I had such

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:90%
a great foundation in my life.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you a funny
story about my mother

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:90%
who's 85 years old.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:84%
She taught me how
to play baseball.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:84%
She would take us
into the backyard

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:84%
of our house in Dearborn
Heights, Michigan,

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and would pitch a
tennis ball to me.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And the day I hit it over the
roof of our house, she said,

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:90%
you're ready to play.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And I became very
good at what I did.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I was in Little League
All-Star player and all that.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I actually wanted to play
for the Detroit Tigers.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't quite that good.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But the emotional attachment
to your family and the way

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.730 align:middle line:90%
they treat you is so critical.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But I remember one day when I
was about 9 or 10 years old.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And the neighborhood kids
all have squirt guns.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:90%
I did not.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And they were squirting
me on a hot summer day.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, I should have said,
hey, this is really great.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:90%
This is cool.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I ran home crying,
Mom, Mom, they just

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:90%
shot me with a squirt gun.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.741 align:middle line:90%
I've got water all over my face.

00:16:55.741 --> 00:16:56.740 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:84%
She said, Georgie,
don't worry about that.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Just call them up and tell them
to come over for some Kool-Aid.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And I went, no, I don't
want them over here.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Go head, Georgie, go ahead.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:84%
So went across the street, and
they're still shooting at me.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And I said, come on
over for some Kool-Aid.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.210 align:middle line:90%
And they went, what?

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, come on
over for some Kool-Aid.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So as they came over
across the street,

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Mom was hiding in the back
with a bucket of water.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And as these three of
them, three kids came,

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:84%
she came running around
the house behind them

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and drenched all three
of them with water.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:90%
They went home crying.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said, they'll
never do that to you again.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.710 align:middle line:90%
And she was right.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
kind of environment

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:90%
I was brought up in.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's pay
dividends in my life.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:84%
How many people don't
have that opportunity?

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So how do they
compensate for that?

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Well, I think
from a parent standpoint, what

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I try to pass on to parents is
there's a big, big difference

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.070 align:middle line:90%
between learning and judging.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
You want your children
to keep learning

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:90%
from their experiences.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to judge them
because of their experiences.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.931 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of
the most important things you

00:18:20.931 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:90%
can do.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.940 align:middle line:84%
I had a couple that's
very close to me

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that I've done some work with
from a business standpoint.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Their daughter is a sophomore
right now in high school.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:84%
In the summer they
approached me.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted her,
because she wanted to,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:90%
make the high school golf team.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.787 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how
much golf has she played?

00:18:44.787 --> 00:18:46.120 align:middle line:90%
This was the first part of July.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.203 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That would be the
logical first question.

00:18:48.203 --> 00:18:50.814 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And this
is the 1st of July.

00:18:50.814 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
she's never played.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.314 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, but she
wants to make the team.

00:18:54.314 --> 00:18:56.188 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And she
wants to make the team.

00:18:56.188 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So I figured tryouts are
going to be in September when

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:90%
school starts.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Wrong-- tryouts are August 13.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:03.765 align:middle line:90%
So we have six weeks.

00:19:03.765 --> 00:19:04.848 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To get her ready.

00:19:04.848 --> 00:19:06.475 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And
the team, by the way,

00:19:06.475 --> 00:19:08.600 align:middle line:84%
this year finished fourth
in the state of Michigan.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's a good team.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was really amazing,
because they sign up,

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and they immediately get
a letter from the coach.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:90%
And they send me the email.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And the coach wants
to know, well, what

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:90%
has Madison's experiences been?

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
know how to respond.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
like most parents,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
they want to know, well,
how do I write this to try

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:90%
to make my daughter look good?

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Make them
sound better, yeah.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And
I says, no, no, no.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:84%
You want to be able to say
that she's having fun learning.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.620 align:middle line:90%
She's just started.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
She's probably not
going to make the team.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully she'll
make it next year.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And we appreciate
that you're giving her

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.940 align:middle line:90%
the chance to try out.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.430 align:middle line:90%
And I sent them that script.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:90%
They send it to the coach.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:90%
The coach sees her.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And when they see her--
because we worked every day.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:90%
We worked hard.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Sees her, and they say, this
kid is this good after only six

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:90%
week?

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And
she makes the team.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.441 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:20:03.441 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: And so it was
all about let's not judge

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:90%
how fast we're going.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's just have fun
learning every day.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we just had fun
learning every day.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And kids can do so much,
because they have no boundaries,

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:84%
if you just let
them grow and keep

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.270 align:middle line:90%
the judgment away from them.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Two-part
question for you--

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:84%
what has been the most
frustrating part of what

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.016 align:middle line:90%
you do?

00:20:29.016 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: The
most frustrating part

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:84%
for sure, and that's
what I'm hoping

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm building into
my new programs,

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:40.810 align:middle line:84%
because you keep learning, is
that people are who they are.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
The brain is used to coming up
with the same type of behavior.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Behavioral change is
so difficult, George,

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
that if you don't remind
them and stay on them

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:90%
and stay on them--

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They slip back.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: They slip back.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And so even though I've share
a lot of wonderful information,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
since I wasn't
able to really keep

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.440 align:middle line:84%
them motivated throughout
the whole process,

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.950 align:middle line:84%
they just didn't
finish the process.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And it always kind
of broke my heart.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
I'm working the hardest on,

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
is how to keep people engaged
until they get what they want.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the
most heartwarming thing

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.776 align:middle line:90%
of Real Change?

00:21:23.776 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: This young
lady making her golf team.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You like that.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: It was an
impossible thing to do,

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and I told them, let's
just manage our energy,

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:84%
because if we just
to meet every day

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and learn, then
the next day, we're

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:84%
going to know more
than the day before.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And who knows if we're
going to know enough

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.710 align:middle line:90%
when it comes time for tryouts?

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be
the best we can be.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So my biggest
satisfaction is when

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.595 align:middle line:84%
people just get into
the learning process

00:21:53.595 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and use their brains to learn
and not judge themselves

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.267 align:middle line:84%
for how much they're learning,
and they just see their growth

00:22:00.267 --> 00:22:01.350 align:middle line:90%
and they keep progressing.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.891 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people, Bob, really

00:22:02.891 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
understand that they might have
issues, they may have problems,

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.927 align:middle line:90%
they need to solve them?

00:22:09.927 --> 00:22:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Most people don't.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't recognize.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: No,
again, your brain

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:84%
has your DNA and
your past memories,

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
so when it sees anything,
it just automatically

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:90%
gives you the story.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Your brain thinks, oh,
yeah, this is the story.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you keep
following your stories.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't realize
that it's just a story

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and that it's a
story you can change

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:90%
if you don't like the story.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So getting people to learn to
take that step back and look

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.930 align:middle line:84%
at the stories they're following
is the real watershed moment

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.350 align:middle line:90%
if they can get there.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.704 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Real Change-- Coach
Bob, how do people find you?

00:22:47.704 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:10%
>>GLOTZHOBER: They find
me through my website,

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.920 align:middle line:10%
www.realchangecoach.com.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do you travel much
where you go see clients?

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: I will
Skype, phone, travel,

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:90%
whatever it takes.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Technology has made
things easier, hasn't it?

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.589 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Technology has
made it a lot easier, for sure,

00:23:03.589 --> 00:23:04.140 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
worldwide is the biggest issue

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:90%
facing people, humans, today?

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GLOTZHOBER: The biggest issue?

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:90%
I think today it's their fear.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I think there's so
many things to fear.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the old days,
yeah, as a parent you always

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.799 align:middle line:90%
feared for your kids.

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But you didn't have to
fear so much for your job.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.870 align:middle line:90%
You could work there for life.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Political parties
seemed to get along

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:90%
and everything was kind of OK.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
You didn't see wars
everywhere all over the Earth.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:90%
So there's so much fear today.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And because our brain
is wired for survival,

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:84%
when we feel that
fear, our brain

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
wants to give 100% of its
attention to our fears.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And so worth we're just
dealing with our fears day in

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and day out, and that's keeping
us from finding the solutions

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:90%
and moving forward.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.563 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
biggest danger right now.

00:23:59.563 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that explain
why so many people are just

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.260 align:middle line:90%
not happy?

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Oh, no question
about it, no question about it,

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and anger and fear are
tied so much together.

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And the really bad thing
about anger, if I may,

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:20.300 align:middle line:84%
is that most people aren't
going to get angry at people

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:90%
they don't real well.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.840 align:middle line:84%
You venture anger
in places where you

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.850 align:middle line:90%
think you can get away with it.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's with the
people closest to you.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:90%
So this fear gets us so uptight.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And we get so angry that we're
so fearful that we lash out

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:90%
to the people we love.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's a real travesty.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:39.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.460 align:middle line:84%
You would think that modern
medicine would understand this,

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
too, that they
could help people.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Because I think 90%
of illness is mental.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: No
question about it.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:84%
When you read about
states like Oregon,

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.716 align:middle line:84%
where people can go and
get assisted suicide.

00:24:57.716 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority
of them now are

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
more and more to
deal with depression

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and emotional problems than
actual physical problems.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I mean
that's happening.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And the medical
community, there's

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.300 align:middle line:84%
a big part of it that's
raising to the forefront.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:90%
But they don't get heard.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, it's so hard to
get what you and I are talking

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:90%
about today in the classrooms.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They should
teach this in a classroom.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Why
shouldn't we-- how

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:84%
would we like it if in second or
third grade, what teachers were

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:84%
telling us is that, hey,
if we're calm, our lives

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and our decisions are
so much better than

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:38.590 align:middle line:90%
if we're angry or fearful.

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a graphic that
shows three caricatures.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.240 align:middle line:90%
One is red, mad as can be.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.000 align:middle line:90%
One is yellow, fearful.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:90%
And one is peaceful in blue.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had a student teacher
in Massachusetts put it

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.280 align:middle line:84%
up in her classroom
when she student taught.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And she says, which one of these
three do we want to be today,

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:90%
class?

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And they all said, the
blue one, the blue one.

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And so kids can pick up on it
so much easier than we can.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully by all of
us chipping away at it,

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%
we make it better
for everybody else.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How difficult
is it for people

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:84%
to just be kind to other
people, to open the door?

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you throw a few bucks
to some homeless person.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.050 align:middle line:90%
How difficult is that?

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: It's difficult.
And the reason it's difficult

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:30.950 align:middle line:84%
is because our brain
and our emotional system

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.900 align:middle line:84%
was put together when the
question was, who's for dinner?

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors,
when they woke up,

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.700 align:middle line:84%
were they going
to go find dinner,

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:90%
or were they going to be dinner?

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And so in that kind
of environment,

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.415 align:middle line:84%
that's why our brain grew its
limbic system, our emotions.

00:26:48.415 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't
have time to go

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.650 align:middle line:84%
on Google to see if
what was running at us

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:52.930 align:middle line:90%
was going to kill us or not.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:90%
We needed immediate responses.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
have anger and fear.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:58.770 align:middle line:90%
It kept us alive.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's still
running through us.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And those same emotions
of anger and fear

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that kept us alive way back
when are the same emotions we're

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.520 align:middle line:84%
using in road rage or
in domestic violence.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it's difficult, because
we're wired to be like that.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.200 align:middle line:90%
So it really takes motivation.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to pull
any punches here.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:84%
You can change, but
behavioral change is hard,

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to
be committed to it.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could change one
thing about society, just one,

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.965 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:27:30.965 --> 00:27:33.580 align:middle line:90%


00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: I would want
to change their belief

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:84%
that the world's a
better place when

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm calm and peaceful
in my reactions

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:47.940 align:middle line:90%
to the world I live in.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I would love the world
to have that belief.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.890 align:middle line:84%
That belief would
change everything.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever walk
away from a situation, Bob,

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and just shake your head and
go, why can't they get it?

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Why can't people just get it?

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GLOTZHOBER: Not
only that, sometimes I

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
have to walk away,
George, and I have

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:90%
to say, why didn't I get it?

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I make the same mistakes
everybody else does.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I've got the same struggles
as anybody watching the show.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I've learned is
at least when I walk away,

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I now say to myself,
why didn't I get it?

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Because what most people do,
they walk away and they say,

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.700 align:middle line:90%
why didn't they get it?

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk away
pointing the finger,

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.770 align:middle line:90%
nothing ever happens.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When one day, and I
don't want to be morbid here,

Bob Glotzhober's tombstone,

00:28:46.064 --> 00:28:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and they're standing
over you, what do

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:90%
you want them to say about you?
