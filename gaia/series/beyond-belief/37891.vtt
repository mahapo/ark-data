You know, I'm a Gemini,

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.865 align:middle line:84%

Peter, always a pleasure.

Welcome back.

Good to see you.

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:51.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How did you
become a psychiatrist?

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:55.122 align:middle line:84%
Not a doctor, but what
got you into psychiatry?

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:57.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well,
I was 18 years old.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.626 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going
to be a professor

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:00.894 align:middle line:90%
of history and literature.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.164 align:middle line:84%
I was in an honors program
at Harvard in that field.

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.034 align:middle line:84%
A friend invited me out to
a state mental hospital.

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:08.836 align:middle line:90%
I started working with patients.

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Ah.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: So I created a
program -- and I'm just a kid.

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:14.508 align:middle line:84%
I'm now a sophomore
maybe in college.

00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:16.542 align:middle line:84%
I created a program
where a bunch

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.946 align:middle line:90%
of us got our own patients.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.179 align:middle line:90%
Like about 12 students.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.948 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Real patients?

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:21.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yes.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.316 align:middle line:90%
In the state hospital.

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:23.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Okay.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.351 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: I had to
twist a lot of arms.

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.086 align:middle line:84%
We had a big program,
200 people.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.522 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't want
me, you know,

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:30.657 align:middle line:84%
putting the program
somewhere else.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.926 align:middle line:84%
And they were afraid we were
going to ruin the patients.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:36.296 align:middle line:84%
And we actually ended up getting
all of them out of the hospital.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:37.297 align:middle line:90%
Backward lost souls.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:38.899 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Dramatic.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: So this
became really a big deal.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.338 align:middle line:84%
And I thought well maybe this
is what I'm supposed to do.

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:45.539 align:middle line:90%
So I called my dad on the phone.

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Love it.

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:47.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: My dad never said

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:50.244 align:middle line:84%
but three words maybe
every month or two to me.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:55.549 align:middle line:84%
And I said: Dad, I want to get
into the mental health field.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.718 align:middle line:84%
And there's psychology,
there's social work,

00:01:57.718 --> 00:01:59.018 align:middle line:90%
there's medicine and psychiatry.

00:01:59.018 --> 00:01:59.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Was your dad a doctor.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:00.487 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: My dad?

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.321 align:middle line:90%
No, he's an accountant.

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He was an accountant.

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:02.923 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:03.857 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Very practical man.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.125 align:middle line:84%
So he said to me,
he said: Peter.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.528 align:middle line:84%
Who has the strongest
trade union?

00:02:07.528 --> 00:02:09.263 align:middle line:90%
I said: Medicine.

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Psychiatry.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.065 align:middle line:84%
He said: I'll send
you to medical school.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And he did.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: And he did.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:14.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And you did it.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:15.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: And I did it.

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.604 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: At what point,
when you got into psychiatry

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.474 align:middle line:84%
in a professional
way, did you say,

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:25.145 align:middle line:84%
this is not what I
thought it was going to be?

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, I was at,
you know, sort of the top

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:29.917 align:middle line:90%
of the ranks when I graduated.

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:33.086 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the National
Institute of Mental Health

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.923 align:middle line:84%
as a consultant and kind
of almost a post-doc.

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:37.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You were a
giant in the field.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: I was a
young upcoming person.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.195 align:middle line:84%
I had two years at the National
Institute of Mental Health.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.064 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You were Sigmund
Freud all over again.

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:45.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, you know, when
I was young, that was, you know,

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.101 align:middle line:84%
that was kind of
fantasy till I realized

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.603 align:middle line:90%
that he was pretty twisted --

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: himself, yeah.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: -- person.

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.807 align:middle line:84%
And his ideas were
often twisted.

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:58.245 align:middle line:84%
And I realized being in the
center of the establishment

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:04.251 align:middle line:84%
that this was going totally
to the drugs and biology.

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:08.355 align:middle line:84%
A few years earlier,
psychiatry had been also

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.891 align:middle line:84%
about psychology
and social life.

00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:16.029 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking at how what
we called mental illness was a

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:20.734 align:middle line:84%
problem of economics and of
poverty and racism, sexism.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:22.736 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at all
these issues that went

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:26.506 align:middle line:84%
into making people
unhappy and desperate.

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.009 align:middle line:84%
And there was another
larger branch

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.211 align:middle line:84%
that said it's biological
and drugs.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.114 align:middle line:84%
But now the smaller
branch was just snowed

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:38.218 align:middle line:84%
under because there was no
money flowing from that.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
The money was flowing
from the drug companies.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It's all
about the money.

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:44.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: And psychiatry went
with the money and the power.

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:49.096 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked around and
said, well, guess I'm not going

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:51.898 align:middle line:84%
to be what I thought I was
going to be in the field.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.901 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up realizing
that my obligation was

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.903 align:middle line:90%
to speak truth to the power.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:01.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You are opposed
to medicating patients.

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
It has been, I think, your
Bible to get that message out.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.616 align:middle line:90%
What about drug to children?

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:10.984 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.753 align:middle line:84%
>> We haven't, and I'm
out of my element here

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:13.887 align:middle line:90%
and step my toe in the water.

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:15.689 align:middle line:84%
We haven't talked about
specific diagnoses,

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.524 align:middle line:84%
but there is something
called ADHD,

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:20.394 align:middle line:84%
attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.

00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:22.295 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe such
a disorder exists?

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:23.764 align:middle line:90%
Is that a diagnosis that --

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:24.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: I'm laughing.

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:25.899 align:middle line:90%
Because you what it is?

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:28.001 align:middle line:84%
It's a list of things
that annoy teachers:

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.171 align:middle line:84%
speaks out of turn,
squirms in seat.

00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:33.073 align:middle line:90%
These are the official symptoms.

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:35.976 align:middle line:84%
Interrupts to give
answers before a question's

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:37.944 align:middle line:90%
fully answered.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.247 align:middle line:84%
What the proponents
of the drugs did,

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:43.316 align:middle line:84%
working with the drug companies,
was take all the behaviors

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:47.754 align:middle line:84%
in a classroom that
require attention and said

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:52.225 align:middle line:84%
to the educational people, you
can control these with a drug.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:55.162 align:middle line:84%
And by God, when you
suppress spontaneity with one

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:58.765 align:middle line:84%
of these drugs, all these
irritating needy kinds

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:02.302 align:middle line:84%
of things go away
for a little while.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
The brain fights back and they
always come back, the symptoms,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.941 align:middle line:90%
or at least most of the time.

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.743 align:middle line:84%
And then often you
get a second drug,

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:12.245 align:middle line:90%
a third drug, a fourth drug.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:15.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How big is this
problem of drugging kids?

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well,
it's just huge.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.955 align:middle line:84%
If we look only at the stimulant
drugs like Ritalin and Focalin

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:26.626 align:middle line:84%
and Adderall, the drugs that
are used supposedly for ADHD --

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:28.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:31.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Which is not
a disease or a disorder,

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:35.635 align:middle line:84%
20 percent of boys are being
diagnosed in high school.

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: 20 percent?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.671 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:38.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: It's huge.

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's really just
looking at a segment.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.844 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't tell you how many
over a four year period.

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't tell you how
many are being labeled bipolar

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.482 align:middle line:84%
and how many are being
labeled depressed.

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:51.418 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is entirely
possible that 50 percent

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:54.955 align:middle line:84%
of our boys are being diagnosed
and that something well

00:05:54.955 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:84%
over 20 percent are
being medicated.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why the boys?

00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.025 align:middle line:90%
Why not the women, the girls?

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Because the goal
is passivity in the classroom.

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:05.298 align:middle line:84%
And passivity and
facility in the home.

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:09.236 align:middle line:84%
And girls tend to be
more docile and passive.

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately -- now the
drug companies noticed this.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And they noticed that the
drugging of the boys was nine

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.445 align:middle line:90%
to one compared to girls,

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:20.947 align:middle line:84%
so they were losing
the girls' market.

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:21.982 align:middle line:90%
So they --

00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:23.483 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Unless we
have boy shooters.

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:24.885 align:middle line:90%
And we'll get into that.

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:30.423 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: So they redefined
ADHD to include inattention,

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:32.325 align:middle line:90%
not just hyperactivity.

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:36.329 align:middle line:84%
So now when the little girl
is daydreaming, writing poetry

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:39.733 align:middle line:84%
in her head in class, they
can diagnose her, too.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:40.967 align:middle line:90%
It was a marketing decision.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:42.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yes.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: I mean, because
what's the relationship

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.372 align:middle line:84%
between inattention,
the daydreaming girl

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:47.307 align:middle line:90%
and the hyperactive boy?

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:49.342 align:middle line:84%
The common thing is
that the drug's going

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:51.778 align:middle line:84%
to suppress the spontaneity
of both.

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:53.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Of everything.

00:06:53.046 --> 00:06:54.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: So the girl's
going to stop daydreaming.

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:56.149 align:middle line:84%
She's going to stare
at the teacher.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.652 align:middle line:84%
The boy's going to stop being
hyperactive and impulsive.

00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:00.353 align:middle line:84%
He's going to stare
at the teacher.

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:04.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why is it that
it's young men or boys

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:11.597 align:middle line:84%
who are shooters at schools or
navy yards or places like that?

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that those
people are serial killers?

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.572 align:middle line:90%
Men, not women?

00:07:18.572 --> 00:07:20.472 align:middle line:90%
Why? What's the difference here?

00:07:20.472 --> 00:07:24.377 align:middle line:84%
Is there some kind of sexual
problem that's creating this?

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.346 align:middle line:90%
What's doing it?

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:30.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, I think
this is a point where biology

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:33.186 align:middle line:84%
and cultural evolution
and culture

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:35.689 align:middle line:90%
and family life come together.

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:39.526 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt that men are
built differently than women,

00:07:39.526 --> 00:07:42.629 align:middle line:84%
that testosterone has a
different effects than estrogen.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:48.368 align:middle line:84%
There's no question that it was
mostly men 300,000 years ago

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:51.438 align:middle line:84%
when we were little hominids
that were gathering around,

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:57.277 align:middle line:84%
you know, a giant elephant with
huge tusks four times the size

00:07:57.277 --> 00:08:01.214 align:middle line:84%
of an African elephant and
killing it with pointed spears.

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:04.217 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's us.

00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:06.486 align:middle line:84%
And we have the capacity
to be violent.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.888 align:middle line:84%
And we have the capacity
to be social.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:12.292 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think there's
much doubt that in young boys,

00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:15.228 align:middle line:84%
that capacity for violence
comes out more strongly.

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:19.266 align:middle line:84%
And I think the capacity for
social comes out more strongly

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning with the girls.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.004 align:middle line:84%
So the boys are wrestling
more with the problems

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.773 align:middle line:90%
of aggressivity and assertion.

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:32.779 align:middle line:84%
And the society also,
until recently at least,

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:34.948 align:middle line:84%
accepted more aggressivity
for boys --

00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:36.383 align:middle line:84%
I think that's coming
to an end --

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:38.952 align:middle line:84%
and expected girls
to be more passive.

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:44.057 align:middle line:84%
There's been a universal idea in
even American culture and worse

00:08:44.057 --> 00:08:45.825 align:middle line:90%
in the rest of the world

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:48.361 align:middle line:84%
that women were supposed
to be unassertive.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:51.965 align:middle line:84%
So part of comes from
just who boys are growing

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:53.933 align:middle line:90%
through human evolution.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:59.139 align:middle line:84%
But the other part of it that
is so incredibly important is

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:03.743 align:middle line:84%
that there is a kind of
humiliation that is heaped

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:11.251 align:middle line:84%
on boys almost ritualistically
by the jocks, by other boys.

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:12.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's constant.

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:13.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: It's a constant.

00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:15.488 align:middle line:90%
It's a big deal.

00:09:15.488 --> 00:09:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Every boy, every boy, has to
deal with this on some level.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.565 align:middle line:84%
Now the girls get their
own terrible infighting.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:30.236 align:middle line:84%
But the humiliation of the boys
has been accepted as something

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.472 align:middle line:84%
that you can't do
anything about.

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:36.443 align:middle line:84%
And nothing, nothing
encourages violence more

00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:37.877 align:middle line:90%
than being humiliated.

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:40.447 align:middle line:84%
Any of us who have been
humiliated and put down

00:09:40.447 --> 00:09:43.383 align:middle line:84%
and shamed know that
the first response

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:45.318 align:middle line:90%
to it is, I'll show you.

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:90%
You won't do this to me.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.955 align:middle line:90%
I'm not powerless.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:49.923 align:middle line:90%
I can strike back.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I'll lash out.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: I'll lash out.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:56.096 align:middle line:84%
And it's in that context
that we end up with

00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:58.898 align:middle line:90%
so many boys becoming violent.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:03.336 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other half of
that is that the answer

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:09.042 align:middle line:84%
to helping those boys is, of
course, to work with families,

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:12.545 align:middle line:84%
to work with teachers, to
work with school counselors,

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:15.982 align:middle line:84%
to do two things: Zero
tolerance of bullying

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:20.887 align:middle line:84%
and helping young men
who aren't six foot two

00:10:20.887 --> 00:10:24.791 align:middle line:84%
and a quarterback learn
that they have value.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.326 align:middle line:90%
They have worth.

00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:30.563 align:middle line:84%
And that they don't have to
prove themselves physically.

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:31.831 align:middle line:90%
They are human beings.

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That takes a lot
of work to convince them.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.234 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: That's right.

00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:35.602 align:middle line:90%
But that's the work.

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:39.105 align:middle line:84%
Instead, all these young
boys that get in trouble,

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:42.475 align:middle line:84%
every one of them just
about, gets into psychiatry.

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:10:43.777 --> 00:10:45.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: And psychiatry
doesn't offer that anymore.

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.479 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: It doesn't know
what to do about it, does it?

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.581 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, it
thinks it knows what to do.

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:49.549 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Prescribe!

00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:51.184 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Diagnose
and prescribe.

00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:53.887 align:middle line:90%
And that further humiliates.

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:57.624 align:middle line:84%
And every known drug -- I
don't care if it's alcohol

00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:01.461 align:middle line:84%
or marijuana, psychiatric
drugs, they impair the judgment.

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:02.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.163 align:middle line:90%
In some form affect --

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:03.863 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: They
impair the self-control.

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:04.864 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: That's right.

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:06.766 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: And the psych drugs,

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:09.536 align:middle line:84%
many of them have
suicide labels on them.

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:12.305 align:middle line:84%
Suicide and violence,
very close.

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:14.574 align:middle line:84%
Many of them have
elaborate discussions

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:16.776 align:middle line:84%
of causing aggressivity
and violence.

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:20.280 align:middle line:84%
The medication guide that
doctors are supposed to give

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.749 align:middle line:84%
to the families of
children on anti-depressants

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:26.319 align:middle line:84%
and adults says, look
out for violence.

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:29.022 align:middle line:84%
But this isn't given out,
the medication guides.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.891 align:middle line:84%
The psychiatrists don't
warn about it by and large,

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:34.961 align:middle line:84%
even though they should
by every standard.

00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:36.529 align:middle line:84%
And so the kids are
put on these drugs.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.264 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea
what's making them crazy.

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:40.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: How would you
like to take a phone call?

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:40.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Sure.

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:41.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Let's do it.

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:42.001 align:middle line:90%
Peter Breggin.

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:43.436 align:middle line:90%
And let's take a call.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:44.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello Peter.

00:11:44.304 --> 00:11:45.572 align:middle line:90%
I'm Carrie [assumed spelling].

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:49.342 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that the medical
association allows the use

00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:51.845 align:middle line:90%
of dangerous mood drugs?

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Why is that?

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Well, the medical --

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.584 align:middle line:84%
the American Medical
Association,

00:11:57.584 --> 00:12:00.353 align:middle line:84%
the American Psychiatric
Association,

00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:03.823 align:middle line:84%
and even now the non-medical
American Psychological

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:08.862 align:middle line:84%
Association are all in bed
with the drug companies.

00:12:08.862 --> 00:12:10.663 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They're funded
by the drug companies.

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:11.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: They're funded.

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:15.668 align:middle line:84%
The Psychiatric Association's
journals depend entirely

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:19.105 align:middle line:84%
on money flowing in from
the drug companies for ads.

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:21.674 align:middle line:84%
The Psychiatric Association
gets gifts

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:23.843 align:middle line:84%
from the drug companies
all the time.

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
The conferences are sponsored
by the drug companies.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.149 align:middle line:84%
Psychiatric conventions look
like drug company carnivals.

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:32.986 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they have huge displays.

00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:35.188 align:middle line:90%
You walk onto beautiful women

00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:38.424 align:middle line:84%
and free samples,
all about the drugs.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:42.729 align:middle line:84%
I get two psychiatric
journals for free that are --

00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:46.032 align:middle line:84%
and the circulation's paid
for by the drug companies.

00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:48.801 align:middle line:90%
You can't tell the difference

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.905 align:middle line:84%
between a psychiatrist
and a drug salesman.

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:52.939 align:middle line:90%
You really can't.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.941 align:middle line:84%
And the drug salespersons
come around,

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.144 align:middle line:84%
the psychiatrists get lunch,
the pediatricians get lunch.

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:01.347 align:middle line:84%
The whole family
doctor's staff gets lunch.

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:02.549 align:middle line:90%
They get trips.

00:13:02.549 --> 00:13:05.451 align:middle line:84%
They get paid to go talk
in the local communities.

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:08.421 align:middle line:84%
It is a such an invasive
[inaudible].

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:10.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: In the old days,
Peter, did they give commissions

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
to doctors if they
used their drugs?

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: They used to give
more outright commissions.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:22.001 align:middle line:84%
Now, you get to go to an
educational seminar in Hawaii.

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:22.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Nice.

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:23.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Nice.

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Nice.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: It's
a dreadful system.

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:31.177 align:middle line:84%
And the AMA and the Psychiatric
Associations, they can't live

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:32.779 align:middle line:90%
without the drug company money.

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:35.515 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they can't live
without drug company monies,

00:13:35.515 --> 00:13:36.916 align:middle line:90%
particularly my association.

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:37.884 align:middle line:90%
I'm a member.

00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:39.118 align:middle line:90%
They can't get rid of me.

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:42.488 align:middle line:84%
I'm a member of the American
Psychiatric Association.

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:43.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: In good standing.

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:45.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: In good standing.

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:49.462 align:middle line:84%
That's a long story for another
show, but in good standing.

00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:50.897 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they
can't get rid

00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:53.333 align:middle line:84%
of the drug companies is they
have nothing else to offer.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:55.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: They're not
trained in counseling.

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:58.271 align:middle line:84%
They're not trained
in family therapy.

00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:00.540 align:middle line:84%
There's all these other people
out there, social workers,

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.009 align:middle line:84%
psychologists, counselors,
family therapists.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:06.913 align:middle line:84%
Robbed of their drugs, it
would be like taking hammers

00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:10.016 align:middle line:90%
and saws away from a carpenter.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: When these drug
researchers are coming

00:14:12.118 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
up with their new
product, are they thinking

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.859 align:middle line:84%
that this is going
to benefit mankind?

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:23.396 align:middle line:84%
Or are they saying, this
is going to make some money

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:26.466 align:middle line:90%
for me and the company?

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:30.703 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Everybody makes
believe that they're doing good.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.305 align:middle line:84%
But the process is
very straightforward.

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:35.975 align:middle line:84%
The orders on developing
a new drug come

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:37.377 align:middle line:90%
from the marketing department.

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:38.211 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: You know, hey --

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:40.279 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: We need this.

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.481 align:middle line:90%
Now develop it, right?

00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:42.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: We're going
to push the pressure now.

00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:44.517 align:middle line:90%
We're pushing anxiety now.

00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:45.351 align:middle line:90%
You know, the --

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:46.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's the hot thing.

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:47.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: It's the hot thing.

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:49.922 align:middle line:84%
When valium was the drug,
it was the age of anxiety.

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:52.292 align:middle line:84%
And then Prozac came
along, and we were suddenly

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:53.192 align:middle line:90%
in the age of depression.

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:54.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:55.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: That's the
power over culture.

00:14:55.528 --> 00:14:56.663 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Marketing
pushes the [inaudible].

00:14:56.663 --> 00:14:58.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: It changes culture.

00:14:58.698 --> 00:15:00.133 align:middle line:90%
It changes culture.

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:01.934 align:middle line:84%
There was a time
when Newsweek had --

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:03.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Unbelievable.

00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:05.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Newsweek
had Pill of the Year.

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:06.939 align:middle line:90%
And it was Prozac.

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.341 align:middle line:90%
That's like --

00:15:08.341 --> 00:15:11.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They'll come up with
a pill to induce intuitiveness.

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:13.312 align:middle line:84%
And they'll sell
it to everybody.

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:14.747 align:middle line:90%
You can be intuitive!

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.516 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
predict the future.

00:15:16.516 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Take this pill.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: We've got a
drug called Intuit [laughs].

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Let's take another
question for Dr. Peter Breggin.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.391 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:26.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi Peter.

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:27.694 align:middle line:84%
This is Mark and
I wanted to know,

00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:30.263 align:middle line:84%
what made you want
to become a doctor?

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:31.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Well, there we go.

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.633 align:middle line:84%
We got the part of
that from your dad,

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:36.602 align:middle line:90%
the accountant who backed you.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:37.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.707 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to help
people by psychosocial,

00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:90%
educational, caring approaches.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.013 align:middle line:84%
That was clear to me
as a kid in college.

00:15:47.013 --> 00:15:51.751 align:middle line:84%
And I could well have gone into
psychology or some other field.

00:15:51.751 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But it was that famous
conversation, now --

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.824 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't famous before our show
-- where my dad said: Well, son.

00:15:57.824 --> 00:15:59.092 align:middle line:90%
Who has the better trade union?

00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:01.861 align:middle line:84%
And I said: Dad, no doubt
the AMA and medicine.

00:16:01.861 --> 00:16:03.129 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well --

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Go for it.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Go for it.

00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:06.099 align:middle line:84%
I'll help you go
to medical school.

00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And did you enjoy
it while you were doing it?

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.735 align:middle line:90%
While you were going to school?

00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:11.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: I actually
got into medical school

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.071 align:middle line:90%
in this -- [inaudible] I got in.

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:90%
But I actually enjoyed it.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.244 align:middle line:84%
For one, thing I was so
scared that I couldn't do it

00:16:18.244 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:84%
that I studied every night
for the first time in my life.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.715 align:middle line:84%
And boy does that
make school easier

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:90%
when you study every night.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:30.189 align:middle line:84%
I did four years of intensive
research on psychophysiology

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:35.194 align:middle line:84%
in animals and the effects of
adrenalin, published papers.

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:39.031 align:middle line:84%
My first papers are in the
field of psychopharmacology.

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:90%
And do you remember Ben Spock,

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.968 align:middle line:84%
the most famous pediatrician
in the world?

00:16:41.968 --> 00:16:42.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Absolutely.

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:43.703 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Spock.

00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:46.405 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: He was my
private tutor for four years

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:48.307 align:middle line:90%
in a special family program.

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:49.809 align:middle line:90%
I actually enjoyed medicine.

00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:52.411 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to stay
on as a pediatrician

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:53.946 align:middle line:90%
and to go into the pediatrics.

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Why was he so
well-known at that time?

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:57.315 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everybody knew the guy.

00:16:57.315 --> 00:16:58.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: He had the
best-selling book next

00:16:58.985 --> 00:17:00.253 align:middle line:90%
to the Bible in the whole world.

00:17:00.253 --> 00:17:01.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Was it his books
that got him on the page?

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:02.488 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Oh, yeah.

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
His books were the books that
transformed, perhaps overly so,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.464 align:middle line:84%
us from a harsh child
rearing to a more permissive

00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:13.065 align:middle line:90%
and caring and loving.

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:16.636 align:middle line:84%
And Ben Spock, one of the things
I learned from him by being

00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:20.039 align:middle line:84%
with him with a patient was that
you can be the most famous doc

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
in the world and you're humble
and respectful when dealing

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.779 align:middle line:84%
with a patient from
inner city Cleveland.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Absolutely.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: And I mean, it
was just a reinforcement

00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:90%
of what I already knew.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: That's like Dr.
Patch Adams, whom I know.

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:33.319 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Same kind of thing.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.191 align:middle line:84%
So exactly what is
ADHD, Dr. Breggin?

00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: It's a collection
of behaviors that annoy teachers

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:90%
and even get them really mad.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.364 align:middle line:90%
It's a collection of behaviors

00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:49.168 align:middle line:84%
that require the
attention of teachers.

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:55.041 align:middle line:84%
This is going to sound awfully
cynical, but this is a fact.

00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Psychologists and
psychiatrists working

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.714 align:middle line:84%
with the drug companies
collected what were the

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:05.818 align:middle line:84%
behaviors that teachers
found difficult?

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:06.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: In kids.

00:18:06.853 --> 00:18:08.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: In kids.

00:18:08.154 --> 00:18:10.957 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew that the
drugs that were being used,

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:13.793 align:middle line:84%
and the same drugs now
like Ritalin and Adderall.

00:18:13.793 --> 00:18:16.629 align:middle line:84%
Adderall is -- dexedrine
was used earlier.

00:18:16.629 --> 00:18:19.232 align:middle line:84%
They knew that they
could suppress behaviors.

00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So they came up with
a diagnosis.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And the ADHD diagnosis
includes things like this:

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
squirming in seat,
talking out of turn --

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What!

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:29.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: -- interrupting
the teacher

00:18:29.642 --> 00:18:32.245 align:middle line:84%
when she asks a question before
she's finished answering.

00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:33.446 align:middle line:90%
This is the diagnosis.

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:37.917 align:middle line:84%
They built it around stuff
that teachers were --

00:18:37.917 --> 00:18:41.554 align:middle line:84%
especially teachers who aren't
good or teachers who are working

00:18:41.554 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:90%
under bad circumstances.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.658 align:middle line:90%
Things teachers couldn't handle.

00:18:45.658 --> 00:18:48.427 align:middle line:84%
Then you give the pill and
the kids are no longer talking

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:49.562 align:middle line:90%
out of turn.

00:18:49.562 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Kid's no longer squirming

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.666 align:middle line:84%
because the kid has been
suppressed in spontaneity.

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:54.467 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: They're brain
dead, aren't they?

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:55.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Well, it's --

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:56.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: I don't
like to use that term.

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:57.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: I don't
like to use that it.

00:18:57.403 --> 00:18:58.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I mean, it's true.

00:18:58.437 --> 00:18:59.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: But they
are more robotic.

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the psychiatric
literature says one

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:84%
of the side-effects of
these drugs is roboticism.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.078 align:middle line:90%
So they know what they're doing.

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:06.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Gosh.

00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:09.081 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge problem.

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Oh, it's a tragedy.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.586 align:middle line:84%
I think it's America's
form of child abuse.

00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:15.688 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look back and
we're going to say, all right,

00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:19.859 align:middle line:84%
we recognize sexual abuse as
being a horrendous problem.

00:19:19.859 --> 00:19:22.295 align:middle line:84%
We still haven't
done enough about it.

00:19:22.295 --> 00:19:25.331 align:middle line:84%
We've realized that
very harsh punishments,

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:27.199 align:middle line:90%
beating children, were not good.

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:31.604 align:middle line:84%
And we realized that the
religious schools shouldn't whip

00:19:31.604 --> 00:19:33.306 align:middle line:90%
people and so on.

00:19:33.306 --> 00:19:39.245 align:middle line:84%
So instead, we drug them, which
is as bad or worse than some

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:41.948 align:middle line:84%
of the more horrendous
physical things you can do.

00:19:41.948 --> 00:19:46.452 align:middle line:84%
Because what psychiatry does is
intervene and suppress you right

00:19:46.452 --> 00:19:48.988 align:middle line:90%
in the center of yourself.

00:19:48.988 --> 00:19:51.057 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: By drugging them,
it's the easy way for them.

00:19:51.057 --> 00:19:52.024 align:middle line:90%
It's the easy way out.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:52.992 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: And it's
the direct way.

00:19:52.992 --> 00:19:54.393 align:middle line:90%
It's the direct way.

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:57.763 align:middle line:84%
That's what lobotomy and shock
and the drugs have in common.

00:19:57.763 --> 00:20:00.099 align:middle line:84%
It's when psychiatry
realized that the way

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:04.003 align:middle line:84%
to make people docile in
mental hospitals was to go

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:07.773 align:middle line:84%
and stop beating them
and drowning them and all

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:10.242 align:middle line:84%
that stuff, just
injure the brain.

00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:11.978 align:middle line:90%
And now that approach,

00:20:11.978 --> 00:20:14.113 align:middle line:84%
which used to be a
mental hospital approach,

00:20:14.113 --> 00:20:15.881 align:middle line:90%
is throughout the society.

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:16.716 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: We dumb it down.

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:18.017 align:middle line:90%
Really numb it down, basically.

00:20:18.017 --> 00:20:19.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Numb it down,
throughout the society now.

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:21.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: We talked a little
bit in our last program

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.856 align:middle line:90%
about the bullies in school.

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit more about that.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.262 align:middle line:84%
We all have cited examples
in our life, I think,

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:32.264 align:middle line:90%
about a bully out there.

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:36.569 align:middle line:84%
I put a stop to one who used
to bully everybody, everybody.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:37.403 align:middle line:90%
But he left me alone.

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:39.605 align:middle line:90%
But he bullied everybody.

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:43.376 align:middle line:84%
And one day I noticed
in the swimming pool,

00:20:43.376 --> 00:20:46.746 align:middle line:84%
during physical education,
he was standing

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:49.448 align:middle line:84%
in the shallow end
petrified of the water.

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:52.251 align:middle line:84%
Peter, he was shivering
like a dog

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.587 align:middle line:84%
that had come out
of the cold wet.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:58.791 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, he's scared
to death of the water.

00:20:58.791 --> 00:20:59.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:00.426 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Now this is the bully.

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:01.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:21:01.494 --> 00:21:02.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And so I
went up to the bully,

00:21:02.795 --> 00:21:05.965 align:middle line:84%
who had terrorized
everybody in school.

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:08.401 align:middle line:90%
And I dunk him under the water.

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:12.304 align:middle line:84%
And I did it on the
auspices of playing a game.

00:21:12.304 --> 00:21:13.839 align:middle line:90%
But I held him under.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:15.241 align:middle line:90%
And he squirming and --

00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:17.209 align:middle line:84%
you know, he's going
crazy under there.

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:18.577 align:middle line:90%
And I let him back up.

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:21.247 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't going to drown the kid.

00:21:21.247 --> 00:21:22.548 align:middle line:90%
I timed it, right?

00:21:22.548 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I said I hope he could hold
his breath for 30 seconds.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Good work.

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And he pops
up and he's gasping

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.322 align:middle line:90%
and screaming and crying.

00:21:30.322 --> 00:21:33.692 align:middle line:84%
And I said: The next
time you bully somebody,

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:34.994 align:middle line:90%
I may keep you down there.

00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:35.861 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:37.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And he stopped.

00:21:37.096 --> 00:21:37.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:38.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: He stopped.

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:40.132 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I did
the right thing or not.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, I think
you did the right thing.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: I stopped him.

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:43.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: You know, it's one
more thing we have in common.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.605 align:middle line:84%
In high school I was five
- four and a 135 pounds.

00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:90%
But I played football.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.874 align:middle line:90%
I ran track.

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:50.743 align:middle line:84%
And for a lot of times I
was president of the class.

00:21:50.743 --> 00:21:53.979 align:middle line:84%
And I was Jewish, where there
are a lot of six-footers

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:57.383 align:middle line:84%
who picked on -- wanted to pick
on me or pick on my friends.

00:21:57.383 --> 00:22:00.453 align:middle line:84%
And I got a reputation, George,
that no matter how big you were,

00:22:00.453 --> 00:22:02.421 align:middle line:84%
I didn't quit until
I'd won the fight.

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:03.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:06.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: And I used to
actually protect some of my --

00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:08.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You just started
pounding away if you had to.

00:22:08.294 --> 00:22:10.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: And it
was the making

00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:12.598 align:middle line:84%
of the future psychiatric
reformer.

00:22:12.598 --> 00:22:15.768 align:middle line:84%
Because I do think that
somehow I got instilled

00:22:15.768 --> 00:22:19.872 align:middle line:84%
in me this physical
determination despite my rather,

00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:21.841 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was strong,
but I was small.

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:23.209 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:22:23.209 --> 00:22:25.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: And I think that
that helped me a lot growing up.

00:22:25.044 --> 00:22:26.679 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you
something, George,

00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:28.714 align:middle line:90%
being that way terrified me.

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:30.282 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, man, I'm
going to [inaudible].

00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:31.684 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You were
unhappy doing this.

00:22:31.684 --> 00:22:32.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Scared to death.

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:35.721 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody would
pick on me and I had to make

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:84%
that decision to fight,
there was the shame

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and the humiliation and
are you going to fight?

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.295 align:middle line:90%
Or am I going to back off?

00:22:43.295 --> 00:22:46.432 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't bear the
humiliation of backing off.

00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:50.369 align:middle line:84%
I had to be a young man before
I got over that and said,

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:51.804 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
fight with anybody.

00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:53.405 align:middle line:90%
This is ridiculous.

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:55.241 align:middle line:90%
I used my mind, my art.

00:22:55.241 --> 00:22:56.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Never got
into a fight in school.

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:58.644 align:middle line:84%
I never got into
a fight in school.

00:22:58.644 --> 00:23:00.779 align:middle line:84%
I always either talked my
way out of something --

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well,
you were smarter than

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: -- or negotiated.

00:23:03.015 --> 00:23:05.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: You were more
mature than me at an early age.

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:06.452 align:middle line:90%
And I really do mean that.

00:23:06.452 --> 00:23:09.488 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was stuck
within this shame thing.

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:13.025 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was not going to allow
anybody -- and that is a burden.

00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:15.628 align:middle line:84%
And most kids, they don't
have all the friends I had.

00:23:15.628 --> 00:23:17.496 align:middle line:84%
I was, you know,
I was an athlete.

00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:19.465 align:middle line:84%
I was, you know, a
leader in the school.

00:23:19.465 --> 00:23:21.167 align:middle line:90%
So I had friends.

00:23:21.167 --> 00:23:22.535 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't all alone.

00:23:22.535 --> 00:23:27.373 align:middle line:84%
But now imagine that you're
small or you're tall and thin,

00:23:27.373 --> 00:23:28.741 align:middle line:90%
which is a very big target.

00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:29.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Yeah.

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:32.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: And everywhere
you go you've got

00:23:32.545 --> 00:23:34.513 align:middle line:84%
to be making decisions
about what to do.

00:23:34.513 --> 00:23:36.482 align:middle line:90%
Is somebody making fun of you?

00:23:36.482 --> 00:23:39.518 align:middle line:84%
Because you're a girl,
because of your skin color,

00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:40.686 align:middle line:90%
because of the way you look.

00:23:40.686 --> 00:23:41.654 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Just walk away.

00:23:41.654 --> 00:23:42.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Because
of a problem.

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:43.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Just keep
walking away.

00:23:43.923 --> 00:23:45.758 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Yeah, but that
doesn't always work, either.

00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:46.959 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't always work.

00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, you know,
we talked about the case

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.464 align:middle line:84%
where the father tried to get
his bully son and straighten him

00:23:52.464 --> 00:23:57.136 align:middle line:84%
out by standing on a corner
of a street saying: Honk!

00:23:57.136 --> 00:23:58.637 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bully.

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:02.374 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't agree with
the way the father did that.

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:03.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: No.

00:24:03.342 --> 00:24:05.344 align:middle line:84%
I think he's -- anybody
who would --

00:24:05.344 --> 00:24:06.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Humiliate.

00:24:06.579 --> 00:24:09.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: -- humiliate
publicly his son, you know,

00:24:09.048 --> 00:24:11.483 align:middle line:84%
like he's back in
the Puritan times,

00:24:11.483 --> 00:24:12.918 align:middle line:90%
basically put him in stocks.

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:15.988 align:middle line:84%
You know, make him stand there
with a sign on a street corner.

00:24:15.988 --> 00:24:18.924 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's got that
rage at his own son,

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:20.559 align:middle line:90%
and that determination

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:23.996 align:middle line:84%
to humiliate his own
son has taught his son

00:24:23.996 --> 00:24:25.631 align:middle line:90%
to go humiliate other people.

00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:27.199 align:middle line:90%
I'm guessing that.

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:28.334 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the man.

00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:30.536 align:middle line:84%
It's not a psychiatric
diagnosis.

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:33.839 align:middle line:90%
But what I see is not good.

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:38.844 align:middle line:84%
And what a bully needs is to
be taught, by his parents, a,

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:41.881 align:middle line:84%
limits: Son, just
don't do that anymore.

00:24:41.881 --> 00:24:42.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Don't do that.

00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:43.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: There'll
be consequences.

00:24:43.949 --> 00:24:44.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: We didn't
raise you to do that.

00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:45.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Right.

00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want you do also,
son, think about the effects

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.389 align:middle line:90%
on the kids you're bullying.

00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:53.259 align:middle line:84%
We know that in fact,
both bullies

00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:55.995 align:middle line:90%
and their victims suffer.

00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:56.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Right.

00:24:56.729 --> 00:24:57.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: They both --

00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:58.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They both suffer.

00:24:58.364 --> 00:24:59.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: They have the scars.

00:24:59.398 --> 00:25:02.835 align:middle line:84%
It is not good to
abuse human beings.

00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:05.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why my psychiatry
friends all look depressed.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.106 align:middle line:84%
You go to a psychiatric
convention,

00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:08.974 align:middle line:84%
they don't look like
happy people.

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:11.176 align:middle line:84%
Because they're doing all
these things to people.

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.312 align:middle line:90%
Bullies don't feel good.

00:25:13.312 --> 00:25:17.283 align:middle line:84%
But even more importantly,
victims can be destroyed

00:25:17.283 --> 00:25:19.118 align:middle line:90%
by what is done to them.

00:25:19.118 --> 00:25:21.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: And Peter, let's
take another question for you

00:25:21.287 --> 00:25:23.689 align:middle line:84%
and see what one of our
viewers has in mind.

00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi Peter.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.524 align:middle line:90%
Dave from New York here.

00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Wondering if you think
there are certain cases

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.665 align:middle line:84%
where children do belong
on psychiatric drugs?

00:25:32.665 --> 00:25:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, I would
think you would say no,

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.768 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not putting
words in your mouth.

00:25:35.768 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Absolutely no.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.106 align:middle line:84%
I got into a debate with a
pediatrician who said: Well,

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:45.344 align:middle line:84%
I only drug 3 percent of the
children who come to see me.

00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think some
children should get drugged?

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.816 align:middle line:84%
I said: Doc, I wouldn't
know which one to poison.

00:25:50.816 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:90%
How do I pick them out?

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.319 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Jeez.

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:54.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: It didn't
go well after that.

00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:56.989 align:middle line:90%
He got upset.

00:25:56.989 --> 00:25:59.224 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Totally opposed, then?

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:00.726 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Oh, my God, yes.

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:05.497 align:middle line:84%
It's worse than some people
will say, this works for me!

00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:06.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Well, we've
taken calls

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:07.700 align:middle line:90%
from people who have said that.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:11.837 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, just
focusing on the kids who's

00:26:11.837 --> 00:26:13.872 align:middle line:90%
to say it works for the kids?

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:15.107 align:middle line:90%
It makes them more docile.

00:26:15.107 --> 00:26:16.675 align:middle line:90%
It makes them quieter.

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:18.711 align:middle line:90%
It makes them more manageable.

00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:22.748 align:middle line:84%
And it permanently, over the
years, harms their brains.

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:26.819 align:middle line:84%
It commonly is the
psychiatric gateway drug

00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:30.522 align:middle line:84%
to then getting labeled bipolar
because you've gotten agitated

00:26:30.522 --> 00:26:32.591 align:middle line:90%
by the stimulants for ADHD.

00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:37.296 align:middle line:84%
And now you're getting
sedative drugs.

00:26:37.296 --> 00:26:39.298 align:middle line:84%
You're getting antidepressant
drugs.

00:26:39.298 --> 00:26:41.934 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon you're getting
antipsychotic drugs.

00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'll sit with a family.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.372 align:middle line:90%
The kid is now on five drugs.

00:26:46.372 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
They've come to me
out of desperation.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Way too much.

00:26:49.675 --> 00:26:50.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well,
one's way too much,

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:54.012 align:middle line:84%
and five is horrendous
abuse by the doctors.

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:90%
And we'll start talking.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.416 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say well how
did it get started?

00:26:57.416 --> 00:26:58.384 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:26:58.384 --> 00:27:00.486 align:middle line:84%
Then suddenly it'll
dawn on them.

00:27:00.486 --> 00:27:03.889 align:middle line:84%
He was a normal kid who the
teacher said he'd do better

00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:04.656 align:middle line:90%
on drugs.

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:06.558 align:middle line:90%
And he's not a normal kid.

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:07.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: And he never did.

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And he never will.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Oh, he
became a very disturbed,

00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:12.164 align:middle line:84%
injured human being
on the drugs.

00:27:12.164 --> 00:27:16.335 align:middle line:84%
This is happening to
millions of children.

00:27:16.335 --> 00:27:17.136 align:middle line:90%
They're being --

00:27:17.136 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: It's an epidemic.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.471 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yes.

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:22.808 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually trace the
huge rise in child disability.

00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:25.744 align:middle line:84%
It parallels the huge
drugging of children.

00:27:25.744 --> 00:27:29.848 align:middle line:84%
We are disabling
millions of kids.

00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:30.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Let's talk
a little bit

00:27:30.916 --> 00:27:34.953 align:middle line:84%
about psychotherapy
and what that means.

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:36.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: There's
never been anything

00:27:36.522 --> 00:27:40.893 align:middle line:84%
like the therapy setting
except for the priesthood

00:27:40.893 --> 00:27:43.262 align:middle line:90%
in the history of humanity.

00:27:43.262 --> 00:27:47.466 align:middle line:84%
Therapists are honored,
privileged, to actually sit

00:27:47.466 --> 00:27:49.468 align:middle line:90%
and talk with and share

00:27:49.468 --> 00:27:53.372 align:middle line:84%
with another human
being about their life.

00:27:53.372 --> 00:27:58.076 align:middle line:84%
This is incredible and it should
be treated as a sacred trust.

00:27:58.076 --> 00:28:03.148 align:middle line:84%
And if you approach the people
you deal with in your practice

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:05.617 align:middle line:84%
in terms of wanting
to care about them

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:07.586 align:middle line:84%
and to actually develop
a relationship

00:28:07.586 --> 00:28:09.721 align:middle line:84%
where treasure the
person, who may

00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:12.891 align:middle line:84%
or may not be able
to give that back.

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:14.827 align:middle line:90%
That's not the issue.

00:28:14.827 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you view what you're
doing as a sacred trust,

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:23.735 align:middle line:84%
that you really need to
handle with care and courtesy

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:28.874 align:middle line:84%
and kindness at all
times, you're going

00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:32.077 align:middle line:90%
to help people, period.

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:33.645 align:middle line:90%
You're going to help people.

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:34.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: So what's
the difference

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:37.382 align:middle line:84%
between psychiatry
and psychotherapy?

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.151 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, they have
no relationship to each other.

00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: At all?

00:28:40.486 --> 00:28:42.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Psychiatry is the
sub-specialty of medicine.

00:28:42.621 --> 00:28:46.825 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays the psychiatrists are
trained in pseudo-medicine,

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:84%
diagnosing, drugging, locking
people up against their will,

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.067 align:middle line:84%
doing things to the brain
and the body of the person,

00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:57.603 align:middle line:84%
including taking
away their freedom.

00:28:57.603 --> 00:29:01.907 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, some of these same
psychiatrists did psychotherapy.

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:05.811 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's pretty much unheard
of because it doesn't pay.

00:29:05.811 --> 00:29:07.646 align:middle line:90%
Psychotherapy is talking.

00:29:07.646 --> 00:29:10.816 align:middle line:84%
It's like what you and I
are doing, only the focus is

00:29:10.816 --> 00:29:14.286 align:middle line:84%
on one person, say I'm
the client or the patient,

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and my problems, and you're
trying to help me with that.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.793 align:middle line:84%
So it's a one-to-one,
it's incredibly special.

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:23.161 align:middle line:90%
Needs to be protected.

00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:26.164 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to be
done with wisdom,

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:28.767 align:middle line:84%
caring and respect
and experience.

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:33.138 align:middle line:84%
It's a totally different process
than a 10-minute discussion

00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
in which you're diagnosed
and drugged.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.409 align:middle line:90%
It is actually the opposite.

00:29:37.409 --> 00:29:42.047 align:middle line:84%
So a good psychotherapy is
like an educational process,

00:29:42.047 --> 00:29:45.617 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual process, a
thoughtful, caring process.

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:48.587 align:middle line:84%
Psychiatry is an
assembly-line drugging process.

00:29:48.587 --> 00:29:51.523 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of therapists
have been falsely convinced

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.828 align:middle line:84%
that if therapy isn't
going well,

00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:59.598 align:middle line:84%
they should send their
patient to a psychiatrist.

00:29:59.598 --> 00:30:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I say, if therapy
isn't going well,

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.268 align:middle line:84%
reexamine yourself
as a therapist.

00:30:03.268 --> 00:30:04.703 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yeah, and see
what you're doing wrong.

00:30:04.703 --> 00:30:05.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:07.973 align:middle line:90%
Don't send them for drugging.

00:30:07.973 --> 00:30:09.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: What do you recommend

00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:11.944 align:middle line:84%
to somebody right now who's
watching this show who's taking

00:30:11.944 --> 00:30:14.947 align:middle line:84%
mood altering drugs,
prescription drugs,

00:30:14.947 --> 00:30:16.014 align:middle line:90%
and they've just heard you?

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.349 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:19.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well, first, you
know, I've written about it

00:30:19.384 --> 00:30:21.420 align:middle line:90%
in psychiatric drug withdrawal.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.523 align:middle line:84%
Don't just stop your
drugs immediately

00:30:24.523 --> 00:30:27.559 align:middle line:84%
because your brain is
accustomed to the drugs

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.494 align:middle line:90%
and you'll have a terrible time

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:84%
if you're taken off
all your drugs at once.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.266 align:middle line:84%
It can lead to violence and
suicide to even to mania.

00:30:34.266 --> 00:30:35.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Yeah, got
to be careful.

00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:37.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Any,
almost any, say.

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:39.871 align:middle line:84%
So you want to come off
drugs slowly, carefully.

00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:40.839 align:middle line:90%
You want to wrap around process.

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.207 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: Under a doctor's care,

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:44.076 align:middle line:84%
but it's the doctor
who prescribed it.

00:30:44.076 --> 00:30:46.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Breggin: Well,
a clinician's care.

00:30:46.011 --> 00:30:48.647 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's your therapist
that's going to help you.

00:30:48.647 --> 00:30:52.084 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your -- go to your GP and
say, look, I've got a therapist

00:30:52.084 --> 00:30:53.118 align:middle line:90%
who wants to work with me.

00:30:53.118 --> 00:30:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Would you do the prescribing?

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.489 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe talk your
psychiatrist into it.

00:30:57.489 --> 00:31:00.092 align:middle line:90%
Some listen, not too many.

00:31:00.092 --> 00:31:01.293 align:middle line:90%
Most get angry.

00:31:01.293 --> 00:31:02.494 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a little
dangerous.

00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:03.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Noory: They do get angry.

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Because they're the
ones that prescribed it

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.231 align:middle line:84%
and they think you're
coming after them.

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:07.499 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Yeah.

00:31:07.499 --> 00:31:08.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: Peter, thank you
for being on the program.

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:09.801 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:11.236 align:middle line:84%
This is Dr. Peter
Breggin, of course.

00:31:11.236 --> 00:31:13.672 align:middle line:84%
He's written a number of
books about psychiatry.

00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:19.745 align:middle line:84%
He is opposed to the medicating
of people when it has to come

00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:22.280 align:middle line:90%
to psychiatric issues as well.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.148 align:middle line:90%
Thanks again, Peter.

00:31:23.148 --> 00:31:23.915 align:middle line:90%
Always a pleasure.

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:24.783 align:middle line:90%
>> Breggin: Oh, thank you.

00:31:24.783 --> 00:31:27.019 align:middle line:90%
You're doing great work.

00:31:27.019 --> 00:31:30.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Noory: You've been
watching  Beyond Belief.
