00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.920 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.544 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:13.260 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.345 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:25.484 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well, welcome
back to Beyond Belief.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.100 align:middle line:10%
Larry Dean Hunter, our
special investigative guest

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:10%
as we talk about Egypt
and the pyramids.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this controversy
over just how old they are.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Many people say 5,000 years old.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Some people say 10,000.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:90%
They push it.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Larry Dean Hunter
says the pyramids

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:90%
could be 125 million years old.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
That's a big
difference, Mr. Hunter.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY HUNTER: Sure is,
it's a paradigm shift.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That difference,
and you may be right.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:90%
You may be right.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the
Egyptologists who've said

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.130 align:middle line:90%
5,000 years or 10,000.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch was
able to say, hey,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
look there was water there
at least 10,000 years ago.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:84%
You can see the erosion on
the Sphinx, for example.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:90%
But you take this way, way back.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
examples of evidence

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:84%
that lead you to
believe that they

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:90%
could be 125 billion years old?

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: The fossils that are
found on the Giza Plateau, sea

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:90%
shells, salt water-based, hard.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
In the deserts, the
dolphin bones petrified.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Whalebones out in the western
deserts, 45 million years old.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.112 align:middle line:84%
This is all the ocean that
was on top of the ruins.

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:46.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just-- now,
where did the water come from?

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:47.278 align:middle line:90%
Just from the ocean?

00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Just kept coming up
higher and higher?

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.104 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:50.104 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
What do you think happened
to the planet then?

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:10%
I'll

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:10%
>>HUNTER: Through
the research, I've

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:10%
find that the best solution
to understand all of it

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:10%
is to go back to Noah
and then follow if there

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:10%
was such a person with a boat.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:10%
If it's found,
where is it located?

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.851 align:middle line:10%
Then from that, use that as a
reference point and rebuild it

00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:10%
from there.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Bible says the Ark
of Noah rested on Mount Ararat.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Correct.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When do you
think that occurred?

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, I didn't
want to establish a time,

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
but with the
geological evidences

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
of the iridium, 65 million
years, the dinosaurs, all that

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
added together,
it to me added up

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
to a 65 million year
destruction point.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:84%
That everything globally
was submerged underwater.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.507 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Noah could have been
around 65 million years ago,

00:02:35.507 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:90%
you're saying.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Correct.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big difference.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.501 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Big difference.

00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the evidence
of the sea shells you said,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
the whale bones, how high up on
the Giza plaza did that all go?

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is it all around there?

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: It's all the way
from Alexandria coming up.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Through the 1800s, people
will show seashells,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:90%
they say, wow, so many shells.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to
Giza, it's 200 feet

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:84%
around the level
of the pyramids.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:90%
You find sea shells there.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:90%
But then Egypt's a wedge.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And I followed it all the
way up, Abydos, Luxor, and I

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.970 align:middle line:84%
find the same thing
throughout the whole of Egypt.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are other
Egyptologists--

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:90%
do they look at this too?

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:90%
It's gotta be baffling for them.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Yes, there's a woman
[INAUDIBLE] French woman,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.303 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
another Egyptian that

00:03:18.303 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
are making the stories of seeing
the sea shells on the blocks

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.830 align:middle line:90%
around the third pyramid.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And so there are
other researchers

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:90%
pushing the envelope.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of them
mischaracterize these stones,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
the little coins, by saying
that they're sea life.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:90%
And they're not.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:90%
They are manufactured.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
That is part of the production
of making these things.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.524 align:middle line:84%
So it's in an area of
everyone is looking at it,

00:03:41.524 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
but their interpretations
are incorrect,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have the
timeline of an event that

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
considers the water, watches
it recede, history coming down.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.834 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see the
truth that way.

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Larry, there's
an ongoing controversy

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:90%
over who built these things?

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:10%
You talk to Zahi Hawass,
and Zahi will say,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:10%
these were made by
Egyptians 5,000 years ago.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, others say,
it's impossible.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
That we don't even
have equipment today

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that could lift the
tonnage of these blocks.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Somebody had some technology
a long, long time ago.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.501 align:middle line:84%
What was the technology and who
do you think made these things?

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, the
technology to me

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:84%
based on what I've
observed is cement.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very, very
sophisticated cement

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
or an aggregate by these coins
that are-- it's like earthquake

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:90%
proof stone.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.926 align:middle line:84%
Where you can have
them and every one

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
of the megaliths
around the world

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
have the same kind of joints,
even the same patterns

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:90%
of structure found in them.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So the knowledge is a
pre-history to anything

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:90%
we know.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And we've been trying to
use modern interpretations

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:84%
for something that we only
figured they could carve it.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
We never suspected, at
least America 200 years

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
rediscovering cement, that they
could have poured them as well.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
it from that level,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:90%
it isn't such a Herculean task.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:90%
It's just a form.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Mold, pour, boom.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And from the beginning,
you know blueprint,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:90%
and it works every time.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:90%
And the construction techniques.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep it to
that simple level,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:90%
you don't require huge cranes.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:90%
You don't require levitation.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you go for the
center of the pyramid

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.216 align:middle line:84%
and you put it up in
cement and pour the water,

00:05:23.216 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
you can build it
layer by layer like we

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
do with a crane
from the center out.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see such amazing
oh, you need ETs to do this.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.831 align:middle line:84%
I think that you just had to
have the knowledge of what

00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:90%
it was you were doing.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And full on fully understood
the universe, our motions,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and so that's why the
buildings are expressing

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:84%
gravitational laws and the
technology of building it

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
is really-- that's
the easy part.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:84%
To me, the amazing part
is how they knew all this.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I-- Did

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody teach
them that or what?

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Yeah, well, because
the philosophy that comes

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a
universal knowledge.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Any planet orbiting a sun,
you can take its orbital data

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and reduce it down
and build a pyramid

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:90%
and it will process sunlight.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's about.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have shown
me a picture of a stone

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
etching of what definitely does
not look like a human at all.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Where was that, and what is it?

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, it's
a doorway, a keystone

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.785 align:middle line:84%
to a door that sits over in this
area of the village of Nazlet

00:06:27.785 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:90%
El-Samman.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.997 align:middle line:84%
Because I was doing a photo
essay of all the doors.

00:06:31.997 --> 00:06:33.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean they're incredible.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
made by these coins,

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.454 align:middle line:84%
so I know they're
coincident to the pyramids.

00:06:36.454 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody has built with
these stones modern times.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.289 align:middle line:84%
They only belong to the
period before the flood.

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So when you see all those
things, you know they're old.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:84%
But then you see as you go
through this little man.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like, whoa,
where is this guy?

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.010 align:middle line:90%
This guy's got boots on.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:90%
He's holding a flag.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:90%
And he's got a--

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's got a funny
head or a helmet or something.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Yeah,
it's very unique.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And it just was so un-Egyptian
that I was fascinated by it.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I started watching this
door for maybe 10, 15 years.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, they put
gypts and tore it down and then

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.010 align:middle line:90%
I found it.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so lucky that I
still have him to this day.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But he is an
example of something

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that isn't in the textbooks of
who is this man in the pyramids

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and what does he have
to do with all of this?

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.230 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And those are the mysteries
did that the researcher has

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:84%
fun with is when
you find something,

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
it just blows your
mind to comprehend

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that aspect in amongst all
of the traditions of history.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clearly, he's
not human looking.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, he has two
feet and arms and a head,

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.570 align:middle line:90%
so he's a human from that point.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But the dimensions of his height
and size, I would say he--

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:90%
we'd call him the little ET man.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So do you think people of this
planet witnessed these beings?

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, made
pictures of them

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and depictions and
things like that?

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.005 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: They may have
been travelling interstellar

00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and planet to planet and
back and forth in that time.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we have UFOs and
this is a big subject.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we've had
that interaction a long time.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But right now, mankind's
is like in the Dark Ages

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and they won't come back until
we can understand all of what

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about now.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Then we're worthy to
reconnect and join

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.274 align:middle line:90%
the human race in the universe.

00:08:29.274 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about the technology

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
that was possessed way gone back
that seems to be gone today.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:90%
It's just disappeared.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.304 align:middle line:90%
The knowledge is gone.

00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:43.179 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: But the
structures are still there.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And by reverse engineering,
it's like an abandoned

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
or how did they
lose it scenario.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the water,
I can see that.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And the water
receding I can see.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And I can see the dilapidation
and the structures being

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
removed and history giving
their version of what

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:90%
they thought it was.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.900 align:middle line:84%
But they are really
devoid of the science

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that's necessary to really
understand that structure.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But now today, we are
very sophisticated.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:84%
We have satellites and we
can see all that today.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have the mentality
to understand it.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
But the application now is
to take it and put it back

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:90%
into to use again.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's to me the
Phoenix coming out

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.200 align:middle line:84%
of the ashes of
this and re birthing

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and really transforming
this planet away

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.440 align:middle line:90%
from nuclear and fossil.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Because when I first met you,
it was survival of humanity.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.526 align:middle line:84%
And this technology really
is the answer for survival.

00:09:33.526 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
We can't keep going on the
way we're going with polluting

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.866 align:middle line:90%
and poisoning the seas.

00:09:36.866 --> 00:09:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I agree.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.176 align:middle line:90%
And it's also free technology.

00:09:39.176 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: And it's light.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But that's the problem.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to give
us anything for free.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well,
I can't go there.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, looking at
this map for a moment,

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:90%
let's bring in the flood.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Are the pyramids totally
covered, do you merely just see

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.110 align:middle line:90%
the tips of the pyramids?

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.665 align:middle line:90%
How high up is that water?

00:10:01.665 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: It depends--
first from flood, 6,501.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
The bow of what's being
discovered or described

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:90%
as the boat of Noah.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:90%
So I had to see.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was in Egypt
here in November.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the backside of the
Sphinx showing people the sea

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:90%
shells on the temple itself.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was describing
that in the time

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
that this was here, the
water, not necessarily

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.660 align:middle line:84%
this, because this is a
certain level, 150 feet.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:84%
But Noah would put 6,000 feet of
water directly over your head.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking to
a woman like this.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a mile of
water over you.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.947 align:middle line:84%
Here in Denver, we
are about a mile high.

00:10:39.947 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: We still need more
water for the boat of Noah.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:84%
This whole area was
underwater as well at the time

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that boat is landing
on that spot.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So from there, it's a
matter of what did you see.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, you didn't
see that pyramid

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:90%
until it got to 485 feet.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this was
way, way, under water.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: And then you
would see it first.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
You would see a little
bit when it's at 600 feet.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Then it would be 200 feet.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes on down.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.435 align:middle line:84%
And there in that time, 200,
the Nile Delta is underwater.

00:11:10.435 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: But so you
would have different times

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.240 align:middle line:90%
that you would see.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And imagine if you're
just seeing the tip,

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:90%
how many millions of years?

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
If the whales are some
synonymous with 200 feet,

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.460 align:middle line:90%
you've still got this much.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:90%
Who is 45 million years?

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Who is seeing this?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So then you have
to go to Abydos,

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and see the hills
that are 900 feet

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:84%
to see the civilization
that's up here.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.610 align:middle line:84%
This is another fill that I've
gone into is moved to Abydos.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:84%
But that's what you would
have to-- in your timeline

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
of receding water, see it
merging, coming up, coming up,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and then civilization
encroaching back on

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:90%
and introducing mud structures.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could
that happen again?

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Well, yes and no.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:84%
I think the second
time where it says

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth will
encounter something,

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at
Planet X coming in.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at a strange time.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.935 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's a
lot of meteorites

00:12:02.935 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
that are going to come in
with this next wave that's

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
similar to the destruction
and Noah's is coming again.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seem to be
pyramids all over this planet.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Are they similar?

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
What you find in
Bosnia, what you find

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.559 align:middle line:90%
in China, which you find in--

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Look at Bosnia.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:90%
How much mud is on top of them?

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Lots.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Exactly.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And they were buried.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But now, you've got
them rediscovering them

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.560 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt now by satellites and
there's more and more and more.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 10% percent
of what's known.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:90%
90% we don't know yet.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it's still
under the sands of time.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Mud.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Sediment.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:90%
The geology of it all.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to break it from
6,000 years, Khufu, Khafre,

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and this, to see
the bigger picture.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I'm here to help--

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What can we
learn about the past?

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:90%
About our future?

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, the history
is in myth and ritual.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.275 align:middle line:84%
The giants of the Nephilim
and the carbon atmosphere

00:13:05.275 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
of the dragonflies,
huge wingspans.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.100 align:middle line:84%
We don't see them today, but
we see the little ones, which

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:90%
is the genetic reproductions.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:90%
Man maybe was 20, 30 feet tall.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And now we're five
feet, six feet tall.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the carbon in the
atmosphere changes and maybe

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.460 align:middle line:90%
we're in for a new one.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think the new
one is they call

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:84%
it the cleansing of the
sanctuary, if you will.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
All the civilizations today
will have to come down.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:90%
And this new one has to come up.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on this and
the knowledge of the universe

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.730 align:middle line:90%
and free energy.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.487 align:middle line:84%
Life can be different
if we approach it

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:90%
from this direction.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.540 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let me ask you some
about some of the material

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:90%
that you brought for us.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Here is a structure
that's weird.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:90%
This is obviously made.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Poured.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: That's the way I
interpret it, not carved.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.064 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think this is?

00:14:00.064 --> 00:14:01.230 align:middle line:90%
There's a hole in here, too.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.896 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: If you go
through the plateau,

00:14:02.896 --> 00:14:05.210 align:middle line:84%
you'll find statues that
have this in the hands.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:84%
You haven't been
there yet and I'd

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:84%
love to take you and show
you these things personally.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But this piece here, it
was an artist. [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:84%
He had it in his
collection of things.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:90%
And I always wanted it.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And I actually asked him for it
one time and he gave it to me.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
But this is an example
of the poured device.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.610 align:middle line:84%
As they would pressurize it,
it would make the statues.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:90%
And it would make the walls.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Because you see it everywhere.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is my best
example of pouring

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.300 align:middle line:84%
because you go from a molded
form right into a material.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Because if you turn
it around, there's

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:90%
no carving on that rock.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And it is composed
of the aggregate

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:90%
that you see here on this table.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:84%
But what you don't see is
the statute that it made

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:90%
or what was behind.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:90%
This is just a piece of it.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So when you get
into these things,

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.530 align:middle line:84%
they didn't carve all
those little hieroglyphs

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
flat on 90 degrees,
perfectly depth,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:90%
and not anybody make a mistake.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.276 align:middle line:90%
But if it's molded.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Like today, we
see freeways being

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.191 align:middle line:84%
built where they put the pattern
being built and then take it

00:15:06.191 --> 00:15:08.785 align:middle line:84%
down, it's palm trees,
and you would think,

00:15:08.785 --> 00:15:10.785 align:middle line:84%
oh wow, the Americans,
look, they're carving it.

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:84%
You just have to look at
the old technology simply.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.110 align:middle line:90%
What's the simplest method?

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Pour it.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:10%
And why can't we
understand that?

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:10%
Why does it have to
require a Herculean--

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the chiseled
pile of rubble

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.740 align:middle line:10%
would be greater than
the pyramid itself.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the
entire pyramid was poured?

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes, I do.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Granite, basalt.
Everything up there.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:84%
We're pouring synthetic
granite today.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Why couldn't they?

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know from my experience
in the paws of the Sphinx going

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:90%
back in the stella.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
If you go down where it's
been saturated a lot,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen granite crumble.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:90%
But that granite crumbles.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:84%
You can just touch it
and it just crumbles.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And granite doesn't do
that unless it's synthetic.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So that whole motif,
if you just take it

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:84%
away from cutting and dragging
and carving into molding

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and pouring, you'll
find you don't

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:90%
need alien technology at all.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've talked
about light on the pyramids.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And that when the sun
hits it a certain angle,

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.400 align:middle line:90%
you see different patterns.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.210 align:middle line:84%
What's the significance
of that and then give us

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:84%
a little demonstration
on how that might work.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: All
right, the work came

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.490 align:middle line:84%
from David Davidson, a
British astronomer years

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:90%
ago in the '20s.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And he basically showed
the pyramid reflections

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:90%
throughout the seasons.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And he broke it down,
beautiful patterns.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't tell you if you go
out and you collect that light

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and focus it back, you have
a power collection system.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So it was really-- the
technical part was-- he did.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I just basically did
this and put mirrors here

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and sent it there and says,
aha, this is really incredible.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So it was that process
that I wrote my patents.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:84%
By re mirroring the
pyramid, hitting the light,

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:90%
seeing it ago, reflections back.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Flawless.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:90%
But now the patterns.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Summer, spring, and
autumn and winter.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:90%
And they repeat.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the rays would
come up and down

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.930 align:middle line:84%
but as they move through
the day, they're constant.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They must've been
awesome to see in those days.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.316 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well,
light's invisible.

00:17:10.316 --> 00:17:11.572 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:17:11.572 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
The only time that
we can see it is

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.680 align:middle line:84%
when there's dust
in the atmosphere

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and then the beams
become visible.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus, I believe
the Greek, said

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:84%
that you could see the light
from the pyramid in the skies.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.447 align:middle line:90%
Because of the dust.

00:17:24.447 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
But if you take that
dust away, you're

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.280 align:middle line:90%
dealing with physics and theory.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So I just do raytraces, collect
it, and made a solar energy

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.360 align:middle line:90%
collection system.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And I had no civilization that
I could say could do that.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I went
to find out who did it.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
conversation is all about.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
We did it, but the
destruction of the floods.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.790 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that in
the time before Noah,

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.965 align:middle line:90%
we had an outside influence.

00:17:51.965 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:84%
The keepers from the
regents came down.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:90%
That's [INAUDIBLE] alien.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.370 align:middle line:84%
That little man in
that doorway may

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
be those people that had sex
with the daughters of men that

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:90%
created this genetic giant.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm just learning is
just like anybody.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.215 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm 65 and I've been
doing it since I've been 30

00:18:12.215 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and I still don't
have all the answers.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you?

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: The truth.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Light.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.344 align:middle line:90%
Love.

00:18:19.344 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's do a
little demonstration

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:90%
on this glass pyramid.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: The basis of my
patent is to collect sunlight.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And this device, the Great
Pyramid, as it exists today,

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.260 align:middle line:84%
is the best example of how
to do that in the world.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.520 align:middle line:90%
This is the summer sun.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.722 align:middle line:84%
You are the sunrise on summer
solstice because of your angle.

00:18:36.722 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've been told that.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:38.763 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: All right.

00:18:38.763 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And I am the sunset
on that same day.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:84%
But what we do is we track
the sun off the pyramid

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and when you come up
on summer solstice,

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:84%
you will find this
pattern of light that

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:84%
is every year on June 21, you
will have this same pattern

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:90%
at 12 o'clock noon.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.979 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they would
see that there live.

00:18:56.979 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, not
only see it, they

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:84%
would be collecting this
light and returning it

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:84%
back to the apex as the
power source of the city

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.620 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient time.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.536 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Solar energy?

00:19:07.536 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So now, as the sun would move on
over and set these beams, what

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:84%
we would say is this is at 12
o'clock, then at one o'clock,

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.160 align:middle line:90%
he's over here.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And then so we are moving
our mirrors in this fashion

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:90%
to send the light here.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.720 align:middle line:84%
In the morning,
they're over here.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.126 align:middle line:90%
Noon, afternoon.

00:19:26.126 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like a clock.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: It is the reverse
of the motion of the sun.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Angle of incidence is equal
to the angle of reflection.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason I went
through the patent process

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:84%
was to document and
patent all of this

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
so that mankind could rediscover
and use this as the means

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:90%
to power this planet.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.559 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this was
carefully thought out.

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Nothingness
into something.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Whoever did this was
an incredible genius.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I've been impressed
by the knowledge

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:84%
of this more than
anything that I could ever

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:90%
have experienced in life.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.149 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A long time ago, the
pyramids were smooth, too,

00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.690 align:middle line:90%
weren't they?

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.314 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Yeah, what
we're seeing today

00:20:03.314 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:84%
is all of the
limestone was removed

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:90%
except on the north side.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.100 align:middle line:90%
You have the original--

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some of it.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Some of them.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine it
covered with that.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what gave you
the reflectiveness.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But today, because they
use it as a quarry,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:90%
you don't see that.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It also had a
gold dome, didn't it?

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: No.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.750 align:middle line:84%
This is what they wanted
to put up at the top.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:84%
The best I can get out of
is Sir Maspero, in the '20s,

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and a Peter Tompkins book
shows a truncated pyramid

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:90%
with a ball on the top.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:84%
That to me is what
sits in the top.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the truncation
is 364 inches.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it an energy ball?

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: I think that when
that light came back in,

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
they then bent them and sent
it down into the pyramid.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
they used the energy.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe through [INAUDIBLE]
and over to Heliopolis

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and distributed around the
world using the obelisks that

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:90%
are in that area.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.020 align:middle line:90%
That's my--

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Tesla know
any of this technology?

00:20:57.659 --> 00:20:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: That was
an incredible man.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:90%
And I look at his work.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And I see-- I would say that
he was ahead of his times.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:90%
And yes, probably, he was aware.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.730 align:middle line:84%
But until you could put all of
this and merge Tesla with this,

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:90%
it needs more research, sure.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.270 align:middle line:90%
More.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a simple person.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I figured this reverse
engineering and looked at light

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and I've gone through all
these processes to understand.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure there are smarter
people out there in physics

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:84%
that if they got a hold
of this and took it,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that it would bring
it in much faster.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And I know that if you
look around the world,

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:90%
they are using solar towers.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:10%
And this is what is-- today,
they're getting close.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, I introduce my
patents to them years ago.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And they took the control
logic of calculating positions

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
instead of using
the optical devices.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And they can collect
light flawlessly now.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:84%
But what they didn't take
was the pyramid, as large

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:90%
as it is, is a concave mirror.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:90%
And just track the reflections.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't have that thousand
800 mirrors uniquely controlling

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:90%
every little aspect.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
You're just following
the field of reflections

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:90%
off of this building.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you can imagine
the solar towers

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
that you'll see that I provided,
imagine a pyramid under that.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And that instead of those groups
of mirrors, you mobilize them.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Like say make them a stage and
then they ride in the field.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have 18,000 or
1,800 heliostats independently

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:90%
sending that light to the point.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So the top of this
would be like the towers

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:84%
that you see, 1,000
mirrors around it.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:32.501 align:middle line:84%
These are the pieces that
would be like your solar towers

00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
patented some of these.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:36.930 align:middle line:90%
What are you for?

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.580 align:middle line:90%
To create an energy system?

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: To show you how to
collect sunlight flawlessly.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:90%
It's infallible.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Better than our
solar panels of today?

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Yes.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Way better.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Solar panels or
photovoltaic in some sense.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:84%
This takes me into Tesla, where
we may convert heat directly

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
into electricity instead
of going through steam.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:90%
But that's where--

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it the
shape that does that?

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: The shape is
defined by the mechanics

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth and the sun.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:90%
That's all this is.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's so simple that
you're going to go,

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:90%
how come we couldn't see this?

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's there
in front of you.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:90%
They can't hide this.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And I suppress this
secret or that secret.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.430 align:middle line:84%
But this is just so big that
just reverse engineering,

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:90%
do what I do.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Make mirrors, see the light.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And then motorized
mechanic as [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.659 align:middle line:84%
and track that light and
you've got power, man.

00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them in Turkey
where they've just

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.482 align:middle line:84%
got a little--
like a radio tower

00:23:38.482 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and they put a collector
here and they've

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.787 align:middle line:90%
got 10 mirrors or so.

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
five megawatts of power.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of power.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
free energy, though.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.163 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Free, yes.

00:23:47.163 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And all they're doing is a
tower and mirrors and sun.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's get into the
controversy of free energy.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:54.760 align:middle line:84%
How do they make
money on free energy?

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.755 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well, I don't think
money in that time was-- Not

00:23:57.755 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To them,
but what about today?

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.838 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: Well
that's why we've got

00:24:00.838 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
to have the collapse
of everything

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:84%
that we know and
get humanity back

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:90%
on track to-- we live 70 years.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.670 align:middle line:84%
These things will last 20,000,
30,000, 40,000, 50,000 years.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Our children will benefit
from this knowledge instead

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.840 align:middle line:84%
of having to be a
slave to the system.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:84%
They may be going
out into the stars

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and doing things that come
from a civilization building

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.350 align:middle line:90%
without I own everything.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:90%
This is free.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.130 align:middle line:90%
This is from the universe.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Why should we pay for this?

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:90%
It's our knowledge.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.170 align:middle line:84%
It's our inheritance
from the past, really.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:90%
That's what this is.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a gift from
the ancient times.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.031 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
that's part of the message?

00:24:41.031 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Assuming we're being visited
by extraterrestrials,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:84%
that this is part of a
message that they want us

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.330 align:middle line:90%
to have this kind of knowledge?

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: I think until we can
demonstrate to them that we

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.360 align:middle line:84%
are worthy, we have gotten
past the Stone Age of things

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and that we are into the age of
understanding light and gravity

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and motion and things,
they are now paring in

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and we can remerge
with the universe.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I think this is what
humanity's destiny is about.

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
When we can demonstrate to them
that we are worthy of their-- I

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.965 align:middle line:84%
mean, you think it's hard for
me to explain to you this.

00:25:17.965 --> 00:25:21.430 align:middle line:84%
If he came down I said
the Great Pyramid is this.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:84%
You'd have difficulty
understanding

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:90%
what he's talking about.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.460 align:middle line:84%
But if it's already here and
we see and we can understand it

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.587 align:middle line:84%
and he says you did it,
now we want to talk to you.

00:25:30.587 --> 00:25:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
all the pyramids

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.085 align:middle line:84%
that are on this planet
were once connected?

00:25:35.085 --> 00:25:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: I do.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:36.209 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:25:36.209 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:90%
I truly do.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:84%
The blinking of an eye,
seven times around the planet

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.470 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.690 align:middle line:90%
They had to keep it moving.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:90%
You don't just stop light.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.130 align:middle line:90%
It is continuously moving.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the electrical aspects
of it and electromagnetic

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and all that other stuff.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.820 align:middle line:84%
We will rediscover-- and I think
that's what the Hall of Records

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.100 align:middle line:90%
is about.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:84%
It will demonstrate
this and how it was used

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and then the kinds of power
that can come from this

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.104 align:middle line:90%
will be in those records.

00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those records, of
course, Edgar Casey saying they

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.050 align:middle line:90%
were at the base of the Sphinx.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I suspect we've
already dug that up--

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: I can tell you
they haven't found it yet.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think
there's a chamber there?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: They're there,
but they haven't got it yet.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.520 align:middle line:90%
They're trying desperately.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.840 align:middle line:84%
I've heard stories of explosions
all over the plateau--

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think
they went there and did it

00:26:26.965 --> 00:26:29.709 align:middle line:90%
in the-- cloak of darkness.

00:26:29.709 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: No.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Because most of
them, they only know

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:84%
what-- it's like the
grandfather's give

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:90%
a little rumor, we know this.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And then today-- let's
say, I'm jumping here,

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to do this, the
Hall of Records is a place that

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.056 align:middle line:84%
was predicted to have
the full on understanding

00:26:48.056 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:90%
of everything--

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of everything
on this planet.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: Right.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And if they could get
that, they have control

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:90%
about keeping that from you.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HUNTER: But if it comes
out that when it is open

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.580 align:middle line:84%
that all of this knowledge
is already rediscovered,

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:84%
then what I'm doing is
confirmed in those records.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know from my stories that
people go to the Sphinx doctors

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and they bring out
documents that are just

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:84%
like my work and the
watchman of the Sphinx,

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.500 align:middle line:84%
he tells me, Larry,
they're using your work.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And because they
have the drawings

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:84%
of the sunlight reflecting
off the pyramid and like this.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.820 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, oh really?

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just little tidbits in
the back of the history of it.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
message, Larry, would

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:84%
you like people to take away
watching this program today?

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HUNTER: History is older.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.750 align:middle line:84%
The myths and things are
very, very, very old.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:84%
This can disturb the
sequence of the religions,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:84%
but the religions of the way
in which they're stepped in

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
are just really the stories
from the ancient time preserved

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.930 align:middle line:90%
to now.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Those are good
stories, but we need

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:84%
to get the full on
chronology of events.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:10%
Then we can see it,
we can understand it,

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:10%
and then we can do it again.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:10.250 align:middle line:10%
So by this work, it's
like everybody behind me

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:10%
won't have to go through
what I've gone through

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:10%
to get to this level.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:10%
And it's like the
hundredth monkey,

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:10%
if you can relate to that.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm the hundredth monkey
that I want everybody

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:90%
now to see this knowledge.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.430 align:middle line:90%
And the patents are expired.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.430 align:middle line:84%
But I tell you for the
listener, get the patent

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.910 align:middle line:90%
and build it yourself.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:84%
You'll infringe
on no one and you

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:84%
will have all the power
you need from the sun.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great mysteries
of the universe, Larry.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching this
edition of Beyond Belief as we

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:10%
try to dive deep
into the mysteries

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.740 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids of Giza.
