Kaedrich, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

>>KAEDRICH OLSEN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be here again.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Things have been
busy, really good-- lots

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:84%
of good stuff going
on in the spirit

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:90%
world and the physical world.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you first get
involved in the spirit world?

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I was
literally born into it.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a house
that was very haunted.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Ghosts were all
around all the time.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:10%
They'd be turning the channel
on the TV, turning on the radio,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.075 align:middle line:10%
flickering the lights.

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:10%
I went to a spiritualist church,
learned how to do seance,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:10%
and was taking psychic
development classes

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:10%
as a young child.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have become an
expert on Hollywood films

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:90%
dealing with the paranormal.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.180 align:middle line:90%
What do you like?

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:84%
What do you don't
like about Hollywood?

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: These movies are fun.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.242 align:middle line:90%
They're a lot of fun to watch.

00:01:14.242 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:90%
I kind of like horror movies.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I grew up also
watching horror movies,

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:90%
trying to be scared by it.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
But what I don't like is
they tell us the wrong things

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.947 align:middle line:90%
about the paranormal.

00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, they get us to--

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they make
great stories that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
are scary stories
about the paranormal.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And, for years,
even before movies,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
people have been telling
ghost stories to each other.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of ingrained in us.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:10%
But when people have only
access to the paranormal,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.350 align:middle line:10%
and the scary movies, and
the TV shows they see,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:10%
they tend to think this
is how the paranormal is--

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:10%
this is what the
supernatural is like,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.770 align:middle line:10%
so that when they have a
supernatural, paranormal-type

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:10%
experience themselves, they
default to what they learned

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:10%
in the movies, which is, as
we'll see, not quite accurate.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it because--

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about
in terms of Hollywood,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.330 align:middle line:90%
now-- it sells tickets?

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's exactly it.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Fear sells.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get people in
with a good, scary story,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.962 align:middle line:84%
they buy into it,
you get more people

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
going to the show going, hey,
what was so scary about that?

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:90%
I want to find out.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
manipulate the truth?

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.690 align:middle line:84%
They'll take a little bit
of what actually happened,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
spin it, and spin
it, and spin it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and tell a tale that's really
extraordinary so that they

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.105 align:middle line:84%
can get people to go
into buying into what

00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:90%
the show is, what the movie is.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But when you really see
what the paranormal is like,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of boring.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I have a saying that
dead people are boring.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And when people have an
actual paranormal experience,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:90%
it's so subtle, so quiet.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.997 align:middle line:84%
They're like, was that
really what it was?

00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to get
people to buy into a movie

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
when you have the real
paranormal stuff in it.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's too scientific.

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Eh, too emotional,
believe it or not.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would be
some of the Hollywood films

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:90%
that you would say violate that?

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.103 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Just about all of them.

00:03:00.103 --> 00:03:00.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:03:00.903 --> 00:03:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: There's a
few that haven't.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.925 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was the first one?

00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The very first one
that I would say that I saw--

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I was seven years old at
my grandmother's house,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:84%
back when HBO was a dish
on the roof of the house--

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:90%
back in those days.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was staying overnight,
and my sister really

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.965 align:middle line:90%
wanted to watch "The Exorcist."

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
original "Exorcist"?

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The
original "Exorcist".

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And, boy, did it scare
the hell out of me.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.353 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sleep that night.

00:03:25.353 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The head spinning
and all that stuff.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.347 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah, the
head spinning, the--

00:03:29.347 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Green guck.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, the green
pea soup coming out.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And the part that scared
me the most is she

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
wasn't in control
of her own body.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't in control
of her own mind.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to sleep
that night in this new room,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
all by myself, pitch black,
I was there concentrating on,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:90%
what was my mind?

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:90%
What were my thoughts?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And I very carefully went
to sleep stage by stage,

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:84%
step by step, aware of
what my consciousness was

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
doing because that's how
much the movie scared me.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be in
control of my own mind.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Based on a
real story, by the way.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes, it is.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
From the research that
I've done into it--

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I want to still
use the term Roland

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.103 align:middle line:84%
Doe because I know it's come
out with a real name of who

00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:84%
this child was,
and I'm going to--

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who has
since passed on.

00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Has since
passed on, but I

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
like to protect
people's privacy,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to stay
with Roland Doe-- it

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
was in 1949 started to exhibit
certain behavioral traits.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Baltimore,
Maryland, originally.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Yep, in Maryland.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Started to exhibit certain
traits-- having seizures,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:90%
having problems.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And the parents did look for
a medical solution which,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.510 align:middle line:90%
eventually the church--

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which you
should do first, anyway.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.015 align:middle line:84%
And the church
still, today, will

00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:40.810 align:middle line:84%
insist that you find a
medical solution first.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
But the priest
insisted, hey, no, this

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:90%
is a case of possession.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
We need to do our exorcisms,
which they did several of,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
before the boy was
actually finally admitted

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
to a psychiatric
hospital for care.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They took
him to St. Louis.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They did.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I knew one
of the priests that

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.650 align:middle line:90%
was part of "The Exorcist."

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:90%
He has died, as well.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And they exorcised
the boy in the Alexian Brothers

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.420 align:middle line:10%
Hospital.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:84%
This is what's interesting
about this, Kaedrich.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
After the exorcism
was done, they

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
closed the room to that
hospital and never let anybody

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:90%
go back in there.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:84%
They then sold the furniture
at auction to people.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:84%
The people who bought
the bed and the dresser

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:84%
experienced haunted
things for the rest

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.577 align:middle line:90%
of while they had that.

00:05:33.577 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I have absolutely
no doubt of that.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about that?

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep, absolutely.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
insiders I've known

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and I've talked to that
knew a little bit more

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:84%
about what was going
on is, yes, they did

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
do another exorcism
in the hospital.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're still
talking in the '50s.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
We're moving into
the '49s to the '50s.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And antipsychotic
medication really

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
hadn't quite hit the scene yet,
hadn't really been quite there.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But when the boy,
Roland Doe, finally

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:84%
did get on a good regimen of
medication, all of the problems

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.865 align:middle line:90%
stopped.

00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
that tell you?

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.625 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That this was
a product of the mind.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
it's always been.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
think he was possessed?

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I don't think
he was really possessed.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: In fact--

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how does that
explain the haunted furniture?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's
exactly how it explains

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
that is because we,
as human beings,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:84%
are very powerfully
creative entities.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:84%
We create all sorts
of spiritual beings.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
they're not real.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying they are
real, but we create them.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
We generate them
through our belief.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
We generate them through our
emotions, through our thoughts.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And so if we were to get
a piece of furniture that

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:84%
has a tie to "The
Exorcist," and we

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:84%
believe that this was
a demonic possession,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:84%
we believe in the full
paranormal experience

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
that it happened, we
will be generating.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're
saying you manifested it?

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: We absolutely do.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, the little boy,
as he grew older, had a job,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:10%
had a career--

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:10%
he has since passed on--

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.347 align:middle line:10%
I think he was in
the space industry.

00:07:12.347 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: That's what
I heard, as well.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.730 align:middle line:10%
Yep.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he ever have
any episodes that we know of?

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.835 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: From what I heard, no.

00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intriguing.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.712 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Once they got
the medication set--

00:07:23.712 --> 00:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he stayed
on his medication.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --he did fine.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it probably
got better, too,

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.305 align:middle line:90%
as the years went by.

00:07:29.305 --> 00:07:30.105 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:30.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And in many, many
of the cases that we see

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.460 align:middle line:84%
of possession, they all have
the same kind of traits--

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.900 align:middle line:84%
somebody flopping around in bed,
using cuss words, swear words.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
They have a strict
aversion to any sort

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.380 align:middle line:90%
of religious symbol to them.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
They might even have welts and
blisters show up on their body.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And the more prevalent these
have become over the years,

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.065 align:middle line:84%
they're mimicking what
we saw in "The Exorcist."

00:08:00.065 --> 00:08:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: However, what
we're seeing in a lot,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these
cases of a child--

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:84%
we're going to focus
on children here--

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:84%
a child in bed who
is involuntarily

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.610 align:middle line:84%
convulsing, that may be
spewing out offensive words

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:90%
or offensive things--

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Vulgarity.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --this could be very
much related to something

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:84%
called psychogenic
nonepileptic seizures, which is

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.072 align:middle line:90%
a form of conversion disorder.

00:08:29.072 --> 00:08:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could have they
have Tourette Syndrome, too?

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That could
be part of it.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And so where we get PENES--

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
P-E-N-E-S-- where we get
this from is it's a form

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:90%
of conversion disorder.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:84%
There is some sort
of trauma going on.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.470 align:middle line:84%
There's some sort of PTSD,
chronic PTSD going on.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And this child is not able to
express their emotional state.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
They're not able to express
their emotional turmoil.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you cannot express
your emotions externally,

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.905 align:middle line:84%
the body will
express it for you.

00:08:57.905 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, then, What
is conversion disorder?

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It is when you
are super stressed out,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and you have a lot of stress
going on, you will get ticks.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:90%
You will get shakes.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
You will be uttering things
that you are not in control of.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
It's because it is a
subconscious way for the body

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:84%
to express that stress
because you're not

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:84%
having a healthy outlet
for that emotion.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But not
everybody possesses this?

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Not everybody.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.737 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody has it.

00:09:21.737 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What makes one person
have it and another person not?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: We don't know yet.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just like some people
sneeze when the sun comes out.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Some people get ice
cream headaches.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the same kind of thing.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is going
to react differently

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:90%
to the same stimuli.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So some people
will develop PENES.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Some people won't.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Some people have different
forms of conversion disorder.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:90%
Some people won't.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, William Blatty
wrote the book

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.240 align:middle line:84%
on "The Exorcist," which was
turned into the movie you just

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:90%
mentioned.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He believed--
interviewing people who knew

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.680 align:middle line:90%
him years ago--

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.410 align:middle line:84%
he believed the little
boy was possessed.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.397 align:middle line:90%
But you don't think so.

00:09:59.397 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I don't think so.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And even Blatty said
that this was a great way

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
to get people to
come into the church.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, no doubt.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.910 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But the Catholic
Church, to this day,

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:10%
employs well over 100 exorcists
all around the church.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.668 align:middle line:84%
And they take this
pretty darn seriously.

00:10:16.668 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They
absolutely do, and they

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:84%
do have very strict criteria for
what meets their possessions.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
They have to have the ability
to speak in different languages.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
There has to be some sort of
telekinetic phenomena going on.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.905 align:middle line:84%
There is a strict
criteria of what's met.

00:10:31.905 --> 00:10:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you still
have to go to the doctor.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the
psychiatric counseling.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.320 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have the
review of the doctor

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:84%
before the exorcist
will take effect.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:84%
But that hasn't
always been the case.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Even the case of Anneliese
Michel in Germany who went

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:84%
through several exorcisms who
was determined that she did

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:84%
have some sort of a psychiatric
problem going on, and she died

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:84%
of severe malnutrition--
basically, abuse--

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
because the church insisted she
was possessed, when, no, it was

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:90%
a psychiatric disorder she had.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what if you have
10 people, and five of them

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.280 align:middle line:90%
are psychotic.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:84%
The other five are truly
possessed by demons.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Not in my experience.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
for decades, literally.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:90%
I grew up with it.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my 50s, now.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not in my experience.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
When there is
possession happening

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:84%
by the terms possession, it
is not by a demonic entity.

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.320 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
If a demonic entity-- if we go
back to the false hierarchy,

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:84%
or we go back to
the "Goetia" that

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:84%
describes the big demons, the 72
demons of classical demonology,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:84%
these are gods from
the Macedonian,

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.720 align:middle line:84%
from the Canaan, the
pre-Semitic religions that,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:84%
in the medieval times,
were demonized and turned

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:90%
into demons.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And if an entity
is that old, it is

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.963 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years old,
5,000, 6,000, 7,000 years old,

00:11:56.963 --> 00:11:58.880 align:middle line:84%
don't you think it would
have something better

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
to do than get into the body
of a child, flop around, cuss,

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:90%
and puke?

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would think.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I would think.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.370 align:middle line:84%
But what we do see in
cases of possession,

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.290 align:middle line:84%
when there is a spirit
in the body that

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
has a little more
control over that body

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and the decision-making
than maybe it should have,

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.300 align:middle line:84%
it's actually not
a demonic entity.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a loved
one that's moved on that

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:90%
thinks they know better.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You think about the moms that
are kind of helicopter moms

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:84%
that are the know-it-all,
that are always nagging, hey,

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:90%
why aren't you doing this?

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Hey, why aren't you doing that?

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.228 align:middle line:84%
They pass on, and
they're like, uh, I

00:12:31.228 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:84%
don't like the way
you're living your life.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:90%
You need to be doing this.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:90%
You need to be doing that.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:90%
And the kid is like, I love mom.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.618 align:middle line:90%
I love the way she was there.

00:12:37.618 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:90%
So there's this connection.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's usually a
loved one that's

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:84%
a little bit overbearing,
still, in the afterlife that

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:84%
needs gentle convincing
that it's time to move on.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And we call that spirit
release therapy, rather than

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.460 align:middle line:90%
an exorcism.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say
to the 100-plus exorcist

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:84%
priests today if you
were at a conference,

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and they were all
there with you?

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
downplay exorcisms?

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: No, but I would
try to convince them

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
of understanding the
power of the human mind

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to generate the phenomena that
appear as demonic possession--

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.760 align:middle line:84%
that if we can get a
better understanding

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
of the human mind, if we get
a better understanding of what

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
the paranormal and
the spirit world

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.297 align:middle line:84%
is really like without
demonizing it instantly--

00:13:26.297 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
which is a big problem, I
think, that's out there.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:84%
We have the demonologists that
will come into people's homes

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, this is a demon,
when it's really grandma.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
When it's maybe a lost
little boy saying, hey,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:90%
who's out there?

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
doing it for money?

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Some are.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Some aren't.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got
to be careful there.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But there's
that strong belief

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
that they're dealing
with demonic forces

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.300 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I've been
doing this for decades,

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't seen
anything like that.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:90%
I have seen scary things.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I have seen some really
spooky, awful things

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:90%
that are out there.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And then once we shift
the energy in the house,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:84%
once we shift the inner
beliefs of the people,

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
the scary stuff stops.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So are you
saying you can explain

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.150 align:middle line:90%
every kind of weird situation?

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, that would
be boring if I could.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:90%
I love going in and--

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So do you open the
window to the possibility

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:84%
that there could be
something demonic here?

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: There could be.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I just haven't encountered it.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen it.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to people
that said they have,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and when I've explored
it, looked into it,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.705 align:middle line:84%
it turned out to
be other things.

00:14:22.705 --> 00:14:24.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the story
behind "The Conjuring."

00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Now, "The Conjuring"--
that's another one of those fun

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:84%
movies that kind
of gets it wrong.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
When we look at that
movie, it's about 1971.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
A family, the Perron
family moves into--

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A real story.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.478 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's a real
story based on real events

00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:84%
about the Perron family
moving into a rural house,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and, instantly, the
paranormal stuff happens.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, in the movie--

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
this is Andrea Perron's
story, so it's amazing stuff.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.920 align:middle line:90%
She does great work.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But she will even say that
the movie got it wrong.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:84%
That, yes, the real
events that they

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.430 align:middle line:84%
were experiencing-- definitely,
things were happening.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Things flew
across the room--

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Definitely, yeah.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and
anything like that.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Definitely, some
scary stuff happened.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:10%
But there were also a lot of
really, really good things

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:10%
that happened, a lot of amazing
and beautiful things that

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:10%
happened in that house, as well
as some of the scary stuff.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But she said the movie, if
I'm getting her story right,

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.710 align:middle line:84%
exaggerated it, really spun--
like we were talking before,

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.050 align:middle line:90%
can spin some of these things.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hollywood
does that, as you said.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Exactly, because
it gets butts in chairs

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and sells tickets, which
is the point of it, right?

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's entertainment.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But did "The
Conjuring" really happen?

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Some of the things did.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:84%
From my understanding
of what was

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.480 align:middle line:84%
going on is there are natural
portals all over this planet,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:90%
some we can create artificially.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And this house was situated in a
place where there was a portal.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
There were all sorts
of beings, all sorts

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:84%
of entities from
all walks of life

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:84%
coming through there--
not only dead people,

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.650 align:middle line:84%
but advanced beings,
lower-level beings,

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:84%
multiple types of beings
coming into that house.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And some of them had
their own agendas.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Some of them didn't.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of them really liked
the house the way it was.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.467 align:middle line:84%
And when the family started
adjusting things in the house,

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:84%
they got upset, which I've
seen happen quite a bit.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But, ultimately,
it was a portal.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And what I think is
going on here is--

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I've got a list of nine
rules of interacting

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
with the paranormal, and we'll
talk about some of these here.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.490 align:middle line:84%
But the main one is similarities
attract and perpetuate,

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.675 align:middle line:84%
meaning, whatever
your mindset is,

00:16:28.675 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:84%
you're going to draw
to you, and you're

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:90%
going to create that around you.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
Ouija board-- one

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
of your most favorite things
in the world, right, George?

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hate them.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.862 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:16:38.862 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I grew up believing
a Ouija board is nothing

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
more than just a piece
of wood with decorations.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's how I
started, too, until--

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Until-- exactly.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's what you
believe that to be.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the things
about "The Exorcist" is,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:84%
prior to "The Exorcist,"
the Ouija board

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:90%
was a great, beautiful tool.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:90%
People used it all the time.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a big deal.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a game.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It was just a game.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:84%
But "The Exorcist," because
of Regan's encounter

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
with Captain Howdy
through the Ouija board,

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.059 align:middle line:84%
turned the Ouija board into
some sort of a demonic tool.

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:10.859 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So now, today, when
people see a Ouija board,

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:90%
they'll go, oh.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They'll freak out.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.765 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They'll freak out.

00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But it's still just a piece
of wood with letters on it.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:84%
It's what you put into that,
what you project into it.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:84%
And so if a person is
living in a home that

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.510 align:middle line:84%
has an open, active
portal on it,

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and they experience
a paranormal thing,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and they go back to
their default of what

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.170 align:middle line:84%
they see in the movies
and the TV shows--

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is demonic activity.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:90%
This is scary.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.170 align:middle line:90%
This is spooky.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
This is awful-- they're
going to be generating

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:90%
fear energy in droves.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have this
expectation that it's evil.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:90%
It's awful.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:90%
It's terrible.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:90%
It's bad.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.370 align:middle line:90%
They're coming to get me.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Similarities attract
and perpetuate.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:84%
They start creating that
experience for themselves.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.205 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tell me about the
late Ed and Lorraine Warren.

00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Ed and
Lorraine Warren--

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:84%
these are exactly what
I'm talking about.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.240 align:middle line:90%
They are demonologists.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.413 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were the best.

00:18:02.413 --> 00:18:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I really
will give them credit.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
In the '70s, they brought to
light the paranormal phenomena

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.360 align:middle line:90%
to the more mainstream.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
recognized that, oh,

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.220 align:middle line:84%
we don't live in just a
physical, mundane world,

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.440 align:middle line:84%
that there is a spiritual
side to what's going on.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:84%
However, being demonologists,
everything they encountered

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:90%
were demons.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the Warrens
affect the spirit world?

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They did.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:90%
They absolutely did.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Because they were demonologists,
and they expected everything

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.155 align:middle line:84%
to be demons, they
could go into a house

00:18:31.155 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
where maybe it was just
a mischievous spirit.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was-- they had
an old, nosy neighbor that

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:90%
was messing with things.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:90%
But, no, it's a demon.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And because they convinced
everybody in the house that it

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:84%
was a demon, because they
brought their authority--

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:84%
they were very much
authority figures--

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:84%
they brought their authority
into this situation, convinced

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:84%
everybody it was a
demon, now, we're

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.270 align:middle line:84%
generating scary,
demonic activity.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, there's
probably a ghost

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.890 align:middle line:84%
in the house or spirit of a
person in the house going, huh?

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:00.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't want this.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't need this.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
the Perron family.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the children who lived
in the house, Andrea Perron,

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:84%
explains changes in
paranormal activity

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.680 align:middle line:90%
when the Warrens showed up.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREA PERRON:
Things had actually

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.750 align:middle line:84%
been relatively quiet in the
house before the Warrens came.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And they showed up just
before Halloween in 1973.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So we'd already lived there
for a couple of years,

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and a great many experiences
had happened at that point.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
We did not know who they were
when they came to the door.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And my mother just
opened the door,

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:90%
and she let them in the house.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:90%
It was cold outside.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:84%
They were obviously a
harmless, middle-aged couple

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that she assumed were
lost in the woods.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And when they
identified themselves,

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.830 align:middle line:90%
she had no idea who they were.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know anything
about paranormal anything.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:84%
We were just living
in a haunted house

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get
used to the fact

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:84%
that we were living
in a haunted house.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:84%
When the Warrens came in,
it changed everything.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:90%
It shifted the energy.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, our family
was under scrutiny.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
My father didn't trust them
any farther than he could

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:90%
pick them up and throw them.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:84%
My mother thought perhaps they
were some type of an authority

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:84%
having to do with paranormal
supernatural activity.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
The Warrens really
stirred the pot--

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
for all intents and
purposes, foisted a seance

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:84%
that Mrs. Warren
insisted was necessary

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:84%
in order to determine
who the culprit was.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:84%
It certainly wasn't
Bathsheba that

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.140 align:middle line:84%
came through and picked my
mother up and threw her 20

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:84%
feet into the next room and
knocked her unconscious.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was was so
powerful that it could have

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.490 align:middle line:90%
killed her If it wanted to.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I witnessed that
event, and Mrs. Warren

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:84%
said that my mother was
suffering from oppression

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and that the next
step was possession,

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to know who
was causing this problem.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:84%
They brought a
medium with them who

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
threw open wide the
doors to the netherworld,

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:84%
literally conjured the spirits
and brought every energy

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:90%
that she could into that house.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:84%
She ended up unconscious on
the table in the dining room.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.890 align:middle line:84%
My mother ended up unconscious
on the floor in the parlor.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:84%
My father threw the Warrens
out and told them never to come

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.160 align:middle line:84%
back again, told them to take
their entourage with them,

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
used some very
unsavory language--

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:84%
that's the night that I
learned some of those words--

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:42.230 align:middle line:90%
and basically expelled them.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She seems to be blaming
the Warrens for these episodes.

00:21:46.175 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: This goes back to what
I was saying about similarities

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:90%
attract and perpetuate--

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.660 align:middle line:84%
that they lived with
such a powerful portal.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Their experiences
were very real.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.130 align:middle line:10%
They were definitely
encountering

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:10%
supernatural entities.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:10%
And if you were to bring in
a medium and demonologists

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:10%
into the room to connect with
that powerful of an energy

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:10%
with the belief
and the expectation

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:10%
that you're dealing with
evil, demonic forces,

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:10%
that's exactly what
you're going to get.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, with being similarities
attract and perpetuate,

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:84%
when I teach people
seance, I teach

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
them to set up protective
space internally,

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to set protective space around
them, to move their mind

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:90%
into a higher state of being.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And when they're in this
protective state doing

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.580 align:middle line:84%
these kind of
seances, they could

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:84%
be in a portal of
that kind of strength

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of power.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:84%
But that similarity that
they're putting out there,

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:84%
they're only going to attract
the higher-level beings that

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:84%
have a better understanding
of what's happening,

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:42.980 align:middle line:90%
a clear understanding.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And they will always have
a positive experience

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.722 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did it
seem, though, Kaedrich,

00:22:47.722 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
that this house had so much
paranormal activity there?

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I'm not sure
what created that portal.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it may be a
combination of the minerals

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.210 align:middle line:84%
in the land there,
or if that there

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:84%
was some Native American
activity that created that,

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.897 align:middle line:84%
or if it's just a natural
phenomena, maybe something

00:23:05.897 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:84%
to do with the magnetic
fields of the Earth.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really sure.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But no doubt there
is a portal there.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
something going on there.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.265 align:middle line:84%
And I will recommend people
to read Andrea's book--

00:23:16.265 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:90%
a series of books, literally--

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.090 align:middle line:84%
"House of Darkness,
House of Light"--

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.820 align:middle line:84%
where she goes into more detail
about what's in the house

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and what they
experienced and she's

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:84%
got great stories in there
about how, yes, it was scary.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But once they learned that
it was a paranormal place,

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:84%
once they learned to be
there, it got better.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:90%
It got easier.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
listen to more of Andrea

00:23:35.505 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and her stories about
energy inside this house.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OLSEN: Yes.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I have always
described it as a portal

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
cleverly disguised
as a farmhouse,

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and there's a reason for that
because the energy there is

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:90%
so--

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:84%
it's unlike any other place
that I have ever been on Earth.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.180 align:middle line:90%
I think that's fair to say.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a
swirling vortex of energy

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:84%
that we never, never knew if we
were in 1974, we were in 1832,

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:84%
we were in 1767, based on the
entities and the experiences

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.340 align:middle line:90%
that we had.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But I do know for sure that
even though there were dark

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:90%
entities--

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.810 align:middle line:84%
certainly one and
possibly more--

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
at the farm, there
were also benevolent,

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.402 align:middle line:84%
loving entities who
would watch over us.

00:24:35.402 --> 00:24:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So she's
convinced there's

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.247 align:middle line:90%
something going on there.

00:24:38.247 --> 00:24:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:90%
I am, too.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:90%
I think she's absolutely right.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I think the work she is bringing
to the world and the message

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.330 align:middle line:84%
she has is spot on, and I
would love for more people

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.240 align:middle line:84%
to read her work and understand
what her experiences really

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:90%
entailed.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kaedrich,
what's a portal?

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: A portal is an
opening between two worlds.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It is where we can sit
in between the physical

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual
world, and it enables

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:84%
spirits to move back and
forth between the worlds.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
A good example of how I
use portal-type working

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:90%
is in doing seances.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Quite often, a spirit will
come through that's stuck.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.130 align:middle line:84%
They're stuck on this
side of the world.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:84%
They haven't quite crossed
over into the spirit world,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and they need a little
help to cross over.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell them to look
over their left shoulder,

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.640 align:middle line:90%
and they'll see a light there.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And in that light are
people that they know,

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:84%
they remember, that love them,
that can take care of them.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, by doing that, it's
sparking their memory.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:90%
It's sparking their emotion.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It tunes their frequency
in to their loved ones,

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:90%
to their memories.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is what's
opening up that portal.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It's creating this connection
to their loved ones

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:84%
that are on the other
side that are like, hey,

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:90%
it's time to come home.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Come here.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And once they cross over--
it's interesting-- you

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:55.680 align:middle line:90%
can feel the room shift.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like somebody slams a door,
but you can't hear a door slam.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.483 align:middle line:84%
You can just feel the air
pressure just kind of bounce.

00:26:01.483 --> 00:26:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know
something's happening.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You know
something's happening.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
tell if their house has

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:90%
a portal somewhere?

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: That's a
very good question.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
The first thing to
look at-- is there

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.240 align:middle line:90%
paranormal phenomena going on?

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And lights flickering could be.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Get an electrician.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:90%
Cold spots in the room--

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.290 align:middle line:90%
is it the air conditioning?

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Is it drafts?

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Get these things checked out.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:84%
If doors are moving
on their own--

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --again, always
remove the mundane first.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:84%
But if it happens
over and over, and you

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.950 align:middle line:84%
get these things
checked out, you

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
start seeing things,
shift your energy state.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Move to a higher state.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Connect with what your
sense of the sacred

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.678 align:middle line:84%
is, your sense of peace
and calm because you're

00:26:43.678 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:90%
going to start generating that.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:90%
If you feel fear, have a laugh.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, if you feel
something fearful, laugh at it

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:84%
because that will shift the
energy of that moment that,

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:84%
if there's a negative entity,
it'll start moving away.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But then if you start seeing
it over, and over, and over,

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.560 align:middle line:84%
you're going to want to be
in that higher state of mind

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
because of similarities
attracting and perpetuating.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:84%
The other rule is
you are in charge

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.830 align:middle line:84%
of the energetic
environment around you.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a portal or
are suspecting a portal,

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:90%
work on your inner work.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Shift your emotions
to a higher state.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.710 align:middle line:90%
Move out of fear.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Move out of anger.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Try not to be so
upset about things.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Move to a higher state
of mind more often.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Do your meditation
work, your connections

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.160 align:middle line:90%
to higher-being work.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And that will shift the
energy of that portal

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.028 align:middle line:84%
to be a more
positive connection.

00:27:30.028 --> 00:27:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to
say, can portals be good?

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: They're mostly good.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:84%
The way that they
fall to bad is us.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.693 align:middle line:84%
If we see a paranormal
phenomena going on-- again,

00:27:40.693 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:84%
people are going to default
to what they see in the movies

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:84%
because that's their
only experience with it,

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're like, uh-oh,
this is demonic activity.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.840 align:middle line:90%
They're in a fear state.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:84%
They're in a lot of
anxiety, nervousness.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.910 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
what's going on.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.670 align:middle line:84%
That's going to shift the
energy and start generating

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:90%
the negative stuff around them.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kaedrich, what's the
story behind "The Changeling."

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: "The Changeling" is
a movie that came out in 1980

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:90%
starring George C. Scott--

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:90%
scared the heck out of me.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Patton."

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It was about a composer moving
from New York City to Seattle.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And when he moved
into this house,

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:84%
paranormal phenomena
started happening--

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.250 align:middle line:84%
a ball rolling across the floor,
something trying to push him

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:84%
down the stairs, being chased
around by a wheelchair--

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.070 align:middle line:84%
only for him to find out that
it's a spirit of a little boy

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that's angry and upset because
it was murdered by his father

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:31.650 align:middle line:90%
and then replaced--

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:32.608 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In that house?

00:28:32.608 --> 00:28:34.695 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: In that house--
and then replaced.

00:28:34.695 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's based on a true story
here in Denver, Colorado.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Mm-hmm.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.730 align:middle line:84%
In Denver, Colorado-- of
course, the author's name

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:84%
is escaping me right
now, but that's OK.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It was about an author
who moved into a house.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Paranormal stuff
started happening.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's really an amalgam,
from my understanding,

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
of the story of
Dr. Robert Bradley.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Robert Bradley is--

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Real guy?

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Real guy.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:84%
He is the inventor of the
Bradley method of childbirth.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Happened to be my
mom's obstetrician

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:90%
when she was pregnant with me.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the
consultants on "The Changeling"

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.610 align:middle line:84%
because he, too, lived in
a house down in Denver.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And his story is coming down
to his parlor late at night.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.850 align:middle line:84%
He went to go pick
up his cigar case,

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of flew
out of his hands,

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:84%
lifted up, and fell
back on the table.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:90%
He went into the scary state.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:90%
He went into the, "Oh, my God.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.105 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
do to me" kind of thing.

00:29:27.105 --> 00:29:27.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You panic.

00:29:27.905 --> 00:29:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And all sorts
of bad things happened.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.092 align:middle line:90%
He has a scar--

00:29:31.092 --> 00:29:32.050 align:middle line:90%
had a scar on his neck.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:90%
He's passed now.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:90%
He's in the other world.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.360 align:middle line:84%
He had a scar on his neck
where a mirror broke the--

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And cut him?

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Cut him.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Lights flickering-- there was a
200-pound chandelier that would

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.855 align:middle line:84%
bob up and down and
sway around in their--

00:29:45.855 --> 00:29:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you explain this?

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.870 align:middle line:90%
A lot of stuff was going on.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And how I explain this is
it was a compound haunting.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I call a
compound haunting means,

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:84%
first, there's something
really going on.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
There's really a
spirit in the house.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Then, when you have the
paranormal phenomena,

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:06.080 align:middle line:84%
you go into that fear
state, and you are creating

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.550 align:middle line:90%
what's called a thought form.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And a thought form
is just a little ball

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:84%
of energy programmed
with "scare me."

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Scare the heck out of me.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it did.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.310 align:middle line:84%
It would be there, and it would
pump him with fear energy,

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:84%
so he would generate
fear energy.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the
thought form exists.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're not able
to express our emotions,

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.120 align:middle line:84%
again, if we're not
able to let them out,

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.058 align:middle line:84%
we generate what's called
the poltergeist effect.

00:30:29.058 --> 00:30:29.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:30:29.975 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That is where we start
using our telekinetic ability

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.170 align:middle line:84%
to throw things around the
house, to move chandeliers,

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.245 align:middle line:84%
to flick lights on and
off, to make the really

00:30:39.245 --> 00:30:40.370 align:middle line:90%
scary, spooky stuff happen.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we're
making that happen?

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's
exactly my experience.

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:44.835 align:middle line:90%
We're the ones generating it.

00:30:44.835 --> 00:30:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And this is what
Dr. Bradley discovered is--

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.750 align:middle line:84%
he eventually had
to go with seances.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.270 align:middle line:84%
He had to bring in a medium to
figure out what was going on.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they?

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.532 align:middle line:84%
And they found out that
it was a little boy

00:30:58.532 --> 00:31:00.007 align:middle line:90%
living in that house.

00:31:00.007 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The one who died?

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.382 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep, the one who died.

00:31:02.382 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And the story of the little
boy was it had a clubfoot.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And the servants were
carrying it out one day

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.050 align:middle line:84%
to go bring it to the horse and
carriage-- back in those days,

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:84%
back that far away and
the servants accidentally

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:14.530 align:middle line:90%
dropped the boy.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.630 align:middle line:84%
The horse and carriage ran
over the boy, and the boy died.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.530 align:middle line:90%
The horror.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And the
parents couldn't

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.960 align:middle line:84%
handle the
embarrassment of it all,

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.127 align:middle line:84%
so they very quietly
adopted another boy.

00:31:22.127 --> 00:31:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And tried
to replace the kid.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:24.918 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Tried to replace it.

00:31:24.918 --> 00:31:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, this little child is
walking around the house going,

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.770 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Where is everybody?

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Where am I?

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And he had a favorite
little ball, this boy,

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.662 align:middle line:84%
and the boy would occasionally
roll the ball around the house

00:31:35.662 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:90%
because that's what boys do.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In those days.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.728 align:middle line:84%
But, now, when the people
living in the house see it,

00:31:40.728 --> 00:31:42.870 align:middle line:84%
they're going to this
ghost stories mode.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.100 align:middle line:90%
They're going to, oh, my God.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.180 align:middle line:90%
There's a demon in the house.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.080 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do to me?

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.107 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: When the
doctor realized this--

00:31:48.107 --> 00:31:49.075 align:middle line:90%
and he's a doctor.

00:31:49.075 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:90%
He's an obstetrician.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:50.750 align:middle line:90%
He loves kids.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.750 align:middle line:90%
He loves babies, right?

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.640 align:middle line:84%
He realized there was
a frightened little boy

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.293 align:middle line:84%
in the house, and
he went through what

00:31:55.293 --> 00:31:56.460 align:middle line:90%
I call the compassion shift.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The spirit of
a frightened little boy.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: The spirit of
a frightened little boy

00:31:59.040 --> 00:31:59.910 align:middle line:90%
in the house.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I call
the compassion shift,

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.870 align:middle line:84%
where you move
from, "Oh, my God,

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.380 align:middle line:84%
what are you going
to do to me" to "Oh,

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:90%
is there a way I can help you?"

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Once he did that, the
bad stuff stopped--

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.680 align:middle line:90%
completely stopped.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.410 align:middle line:84%
He was now living in
a very beautiful way

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:19.820 align:middle line:90%
with a little boy in the house.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.730 align:middle line:84%
The doctor would have two
seances a month in there.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And all of the scary
stuff completely

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.030 align:middle line:84%
stopped because he shifted
his internal energy,

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:84%
his internal emotions, which
changed the energy around him.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.777 align:middle line:84%
And the scared little
boy was just fine.

00:32:35.777 --> 00:32:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's where
the compassion comes in.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's exactly where
the compassion comes in.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind of thing
I teach people all the time.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.013 align:middle line:84%
If there's bad stuff
going on in the house,

00:32:44.013 --> 00:32:45.930 align:middle line:84%
if you're experiencing
the poltergeist effect,

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.730 align:middle line:84%
things are flying
around, and you're

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.050 align:middle line:84%
having a really negative
experience with your house,

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:50.850 align:middle line:90%
it's real.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:51.938 align:middle line:90%
It's really happening.

00:32:51.938 --> 00:32:53.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to discount that.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:54.210 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.738 align:middle line:84%
But instead of
going, oh, my God,

00:32:55.738 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to do to me?

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Go to, oh, is there
somebody that needs help?

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.058 align:middle line:84%
Now, people might
initially say, OK,

00:33:02.058 --> 00:33:04.350 align:middle line:84%
you do that, you're going to
open yourself up to attack

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.470 align:middle line:90%
because you're now open.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:06.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:84%
If there is something
negative, and you

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:84%
are bringing a compassionate,
loving energy into that,

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.885 align:middle line:84%
this negative thing is
not going to like that.

00:33:14.885 --> 00:33:16.260 align:middle line:84%
It's going to feel
that, and it's

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.632 align:middle line:84%
going to be like, oh,
I'm out of here, which

00:33:18.632 --> 00:33:19.840 align:middle line:90%
means you got to double down.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.660 align:middle line:84%
You just keep putting out
that compassion energy.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.630 align:middle line:90%
How can I help you?

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:90%
How can I serve?

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Is there some help
that you need?

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.110 align:middle line:90%
How can I help you?

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And if there really is
a spirit in the house,

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.280 align:middle line:90%
it'll tune in to you.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.185 align:middle line:90%
It'll tap in.

00:33:30.185 --> 00:33:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And you get that little
message of like, hey, yeah,

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.840 align:middle line:90%
can you do this for me?

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And you resolve that, and you
help that spirit cross over--

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.565 align:middle line:90%
gone.

00:33:37.565 --> 00:33:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Andrea Perron talks about
her sister visiting the house

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.370 align:middle line:84%
decades later and the things
that they went through.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: The light
spirits didn't

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:51.190 align:middle line:84%
want us to interact
with the dark spirits,

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:84%
nor did they want the darker
entities to haunt or taunt us

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:90%
in the house.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, my
sisters, Nancy and Cindy,

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.130 align:middle line:90%
went back to the house.

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:04.990 align:middle line:90%
We left in 1980.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:84%
And in 1996, they
went back to the house

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:12.699 align:middle line:84%
to visit who was the
current owner at the time.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And she invited
them into the house.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And both of them had their faces
touched and their hair stroked,

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.770 align:middle line:84%
and they both felt that
she was holding back

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.960 align:middle line:90%
something that was much darker.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And, simultaneously, they
both heard, oh, my God.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:31.989 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:90%
You're back.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:38.409 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's no explaining that.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:90%
There's no explaining it.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But both of them
said that they felt

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.699 align:middle line:90%
protected in those moments.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And my sister Cindy has always
said that the spirits couldn't

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.300 align:middle line:84%
come with us because
the good ones loved us,

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and they would have
come if they could.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.440 align:middle line:84%
She felt that they
were trapped there.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.400 align:middle line:84%
She, to this day, feels
that they are trapped there.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.800 align:middle line:90%
And there's no explaining this.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:84%
We might not ever
have the answers

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.110 align:middle line:90%
to exactly who they were.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:21.870 align:middle line:84%
To me, it doesn't matter
who they were in life.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.420 align:middle line:84%
That they still
are in afterlife--

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.200 align:middle line:90%
that's all that matters to me.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the miracle.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:31.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the magic of that
place, magic being science

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.317 align:middle line:90%
that we don't yet understand.

00:35:33.317 --> 00:35:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She got
very emotional there.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.025 align:middle line:90%
What did you think of that?

00:35:36.025 --> 00:35:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep, absolutely.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.505 align:middle line:90%
And she's right.

00:35:38.505 --> 00:35:41.970 align:middle line:84%
The vast, vast majority of the
spirits in the spirit world

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.210 align:middle line:84%
are very kind, very
benevolent, very protective.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.370 align:middle line:84%
There might be some
wonky things out there

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:51.030 align:middle line:84%
that we need to watch out
and be careful of-- people

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.500 align:middle line:90%
who have been misguided.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.670 align:middle line:90%
People are people, right?

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.190 align:middle line:84%
In lifetime, sometimes
we're not so good of people.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.480 align:middle line:90%
You cross over.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:90%
You still might not be so good.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.850 align:middle line:90%
So there's some work to be done.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And then there are such things
as egregores, which are still--

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:04.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:36:04.648 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: These are
human-generated spirits

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:07.790 align:middle line:90%
by our belief.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to talk about an
abandoned insane asylum, about

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:84%
all the horrors that went on
there, about the spirits that

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.810 align:middle line:84%
are there, about the
negative experiences,

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:20.890 align:middle line:84%
our collective belief will
create what I call a big nasty.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:24.220 align:middle line:84%
It's an egregore-- a
collectively-created entity

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.860 align:middle line:84%
that is one of those big
nasty scary things that

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:84%
live in there that thrive off
of our belief, that thrive off

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.340 align:middle line:84%
of our fear and will do
the things to support

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.910 align:middle line:90%
that and promote that.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we will find some
of these negative things

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.030 align:middle line:84%
out there, and it will seem
like those spirits are trapped

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.340 align:middle line:84%
in those places
because they're feeding

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.050 align:middle line:90%
that egregore what it needs.

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.773 align:middle line:84%
But, ultimately, we're the ones
feeding it through our belief.

00:36:46.773 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I don't think
the movies intentionally

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.350 align:middle line:84%
try to deceive people
from the truth.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.810 align:middle line:90%
They're not documentaries.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're movies.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:90%
They're entertainment.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.880 align:middle line:10%
They're there to get people
to watch you and come and sell

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.508 align:middle line:10%
your millions of dollars'
worth of movie tickets.

00:37:00.508 --> 00:37:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I absolutely
agree with you.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:02.860 align:middle line:90%
They're fun.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And if we remember that they
are entertainment and completely

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.670 align:middle line:90%
fiction, correct.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:09.200 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely true.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.560 align:middle line:84%
The only problem
that I have is when

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.118 align:middle line:84%
people start taking that
this is reality because they

00:37:14.118 --> 00:37:15.160 align:middle line:90%
don't have anything else.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how
many people do that?

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.560 align:middle line:90%
A lot.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: A lot, because they
don't know the difference.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
I'll relate back to the Perron

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.900 align:middle line:84%
family is imagine
they were trained

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.805 align:middle line:90%
to coexist with the paranormal.

00:37:27.805 --> 00:37:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that, when they
went into that house,

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.840 align:middle line:84%
they were taught that
the supernatural is

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.397 align:middle line:84%
a completely natural part
of our world and that--

00:37:34.397 --> 00:37:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Live with it.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --we cocreate,
and we can live with it.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.320 align:middle line:84%
We can interact with
it and experiencing it.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm betting all of
their experiences

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:84%
would have been so much better,
if people like the Warrens

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.185 align:middle line:84%
didn't assume
everything were demons,

00:37:45.185 --> 00:37:46.810 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
into people's houses

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and teaching them how to
coexist with this energy,

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:84%
how to share this
space with these beings

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.380 align:middle line:84%
because we are spiritual and
physical beings ourselves.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.100 align:middle line:84%
We are the other half of this
equation of the natural world,

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.780 align:middle line:90%
so we can coexist.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So imagine if people are
taught that, instead.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.567 align:middle line:84%
We could still watch these scary
movies and have a great time.

00:38:04.567 --> 00:38:07.150 align:middle line:84%
But then we go home and hang out
with the spirits in the house

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, how are
you doing, Charlie?

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Having a great day.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Hope you are, too.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:12.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would
guess, Kaedrich,

00:38:12.065 --> 00:38:13.750 align:middle line:84%
if I were an executive
doing a movie,

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I would do it the exact same
way they're doing it today.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is make it
exciting, and interesting,

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.040 align:middle line:90%
and fascinating.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: I agree.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I just want more out
there in addition

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.792 align:middle line:84%
to the movies to help
people realize the beauty

00:38:26.792 --> 00:38:28.000 align:middle line:90%
and wonder of the paranormal.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.083 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you're
talking documentaries, then.

00:38:30.083 --> 00:38:32.890 align:middle line:10%
But how many people will
watch a documentary compared

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.280 align:middle line:10%
to an entertaining movie?

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love the work
we're doing here, George.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I love the questions
you're asking,

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and I love that your audience
is here learning these things

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and being exposed to
this other side of things

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:46.030 align:middle line:84%
because we're opening
minds, and we're

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.160 align:middle line:84%
helping raise people's
spiritual beings

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.760 align:middle line:84%
to a higher state of being
to realize it isn't so scary.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's real.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's real, and we're
helping people to see that.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has ever
scared you in your life?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: People.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: People scare
me-- turning on the news

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what's
going on in the world.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's horrible.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:04.532 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's horrible.

00:39:04.532 --> 00:39:06.990 align:middle line:90%
That's really scary stuff.

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.990 align:middle line:90%
But in the supernatural--

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.493 align:middle line:90%
since when I was a kid, yes.

00:39:11.493 --> 00:39:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I had a hard time going
to sleep because there

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.493 align:middle line:90%
were spirits in the house.

00:39:14.493 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was really mostly
exposed to the movies,

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.600 align:middle line:84%
so I had a hard time
going to sleep as a kid.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.400 align:middle line:84%
"The Exorcist" scared
the heck out of me.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But, over the years, as I worked
with my whisperers, my guides,

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.040 align:middle line:84%
my teachers, and I learned how
to interact with those energies

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.020 align:middle line:90%
and the spirits, it's gone.

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:32.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever let
your arm rest over the bed?

00:39:32.985 --> 00:39:33.930 align:middle line:90%
That scared me.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always thought there
was something underneath it.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.420 align:middle line:90%
And I don't like clowns, either.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Clowns are spooky.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Clowns are spooky.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What movies do
you think get it right?

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: There are some.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:84%
There are some that
actually get it right.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.680 align:middle line:84%
"The Others" is one
of them that I think

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.118 align:middle line:84%
gets it right, the
Nicole Kidman movie.

00:39:52.118 --> 00:39:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
Robin Williams movie--

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that movie.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Oh, yeah,
it was a great movie.

00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The Robin Williams movie
"What Dreams May Come"--

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:02.650 align:middle line:84%
that's another one I
think gets things right.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Robin
Williams "What

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Dreams May Come" was a classic.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.840 align:middle line:90%
"What Dreams May Come"--

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.530 align:middle line:84%
based on the work of
Emanuel Swedenborg, who

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:15.160 align:middle line:84%
was taken out of his body
by his guides, his teachers,

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.980 align:middle line:84%
the angelic beings and
shown different places

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.180 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, the other
world, the spirit world,

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.650 align:middle line:84%
so that he could see the
good, the bad, the ugly,

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful, the fact that
the humans themselves, us,

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:90%
we create our own afterlife.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was what was
reflected in this movie.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.660 align:middle line:84%
When the doctor, played
by Robin Williams, died,

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.070 align:middle line:84%
he literally went into a painted
landscape of his own creation.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And when he was able
to finally adapt,

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:47.470 align:middle line:84%
when he was able to finally
get out of this blurry phase

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and adapt to the
afterlife, he went

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.730 align:middle line:84%
into more of a
communal space where

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:55.360 align:middle line:84%
there's shared creativity, where
people can kind of collaborate

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.170 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.970 align:middle line:84%
But there were still
those dark places.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.900 align:middle line:84%
There were still those
places where people--

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.170 align:middle line:84%
where they feel that they
needed maybe some negativity

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.970 align:middle line:90%
to themselves.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And, in real life,
he ended up in a dark place.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:07.135 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Robin Williams?

00:41:07.135 --> 00:41:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, unfortunately.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Took his own life.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:09.775 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: His whole life.

00:41:09.775 --> 00:41:11.285 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
whole, sad story.

00:41:11.285 --> 00:41:12.730 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: It is a
really sad story.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.800 align:middle line:84%
He's a beautiful man,
did some beautiful work.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's just unfortunate
the internal pain

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.133 align:middle line:90%
he was going through.

00:41:19.133 --> 00:41:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll always
remember that scene

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.390 align:middle line:84%
in "What Dreams
May Come" where he

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:26.590 align:middle line:84%
was stepping on the heads
of people in heaven or hell,

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:28.890 align:middle line:84%
wherever they were--
remember that one?

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --squashing them.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of those
things that we kind of find.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:38.640 align:middle line:84%
My own guides took me
on different journeys

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.100 align:middle line:84%
to the afterlife, to the
other world to show me things.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.320 align:middle line:84%
They once showed me a
place very similar to that.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same thing
but a very similar.

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:49.350 align:middle line:84%
It was a bunch of people
standing around with their eyes

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.250 align:middle line:90%
just glazed over.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:53.620 align:middle line:84%
They're just like
staring off into space.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was, like,
a whole field of them.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's
going on here?

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.710 align:middle line:90%
What am I seeing?

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.630 align:middle line:10%
And they told me, this is hell.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what do
you mean this is hell?

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one
of these people

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:07.202 align:middle line:84%
here believed that they
were a bad person in life

00:42:07.202 --> 00:42:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and that they have to atone
for something through some sort

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.780 align:middle line:84%
of personal torment, so they
are living through that torment

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.520 align:middle line:90%
in their own, inner world.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, how do
they get out of this?

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Can they?

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.370 align:middle line:90%
And I was told, yes.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Look carefully.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:22.342 align:middle line:84%
There are other people standing
around them whispering to them.

00:42:22.342 --> 00:42:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So when they wake up a
little bit, and they go,

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.200 align:middle line:90%
do I really have to be here?

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.030 align:middle line:90%
A whisperer will be like, no.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
out there different?

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And then they'll sink
back into their dark torment

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.192 align:middle line:84%
till they come back
out a little bit.

00:42:34.192 --> 00:42:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, well,
how do I get out of here?

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, think about
something wonderful.

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Think about something good.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe they will, and
then they'll come out of it.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So the dead are not
eternally tormented.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.670 align:middle line:84%
It is just their own, personal
thing that they go through.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And once they realize
with their own, free will

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.163 align:middle line:84%
they don't have
to be there, they

00:42:54.163 --> 00:42:56.080 align:middle line:84%
can use their own, free
will to get out of it.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.497 align:middle line:84%
And there are whisperers there
to help them get out of it.

00:42:58.497 --> 00:43:00.913 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kaedrich, what do you
recommend people do if they

00:43:00.913 --> 00:43:02.350 align:middle line:90%
think their house is haunted?

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Have fun with it.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.300 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I'm saying have
fun with it-- laugh at it.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Have a sense of awe and wonder.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.330 align:middle line:90%
When I teach--

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Until it
throws a knife at you.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Even if it
does throw a knife.

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:16.420 align:middle line:84%
This is what I
tell ghost hunters,

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:84%
paranormal investigators because
I'll train them to keep safe.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I tell them that if you see
something fly across the room

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:84%
or you see like that
black mist forming

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.570 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the room,
have a moment to go, wow,

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:30.850 align:middle line:90%
that's really amazing.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:90%
You can do that?

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Do it again.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Or if it's something making you
feel fearful or uncomfortable,

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.250 align:middle line:90%
unease, have a laugh.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Laugh at it because,
remember, similarities

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.780 align:middle line:90%
attract and perpetuate.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.760 align:middle line:84%
If this thing is
trying to scare you,

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.230 align:middle line:84%
if it's trying to put you into
a negative emotional state,

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:52.720 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be generating
the energy that will

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.030 align:middle line:90%
support its behaving that way.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can feed it.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah,
you're feeding it.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.830 align:middle line:10%
But if you can have awe and
wonder, you can have laughter,

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:01.870 align:middle line:10%
you can play with it,
you have fun with it,

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.490 align:middle line:10%
it'll push the
negative stuff away.

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:07.180 align:middle line:10%
And if it really is
grandma coming to say hi,

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.180 align:middle line:10%
if it really is a little
kid playing in the house,

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.950 align:middle line:10%
then you're going to generate
this positive, powerful,

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:16.300 align:middle line:10%
wonderful energy that they're
going to connect with you.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
realize, oh, hi, grandma.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:19.660 align:middle line:90%
It's been a long time.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:20.590 align:middle line:90%
How have you been?

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.690 align:middle line:84%
That was you messing
with a book on the shelf?

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, what book
is that you're messing with?

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And you pull it off the
shelf, and you go, oh, yeah, I

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.390 align:middle line:90%
remember when we read that.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:30.793 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can connect with
her, instead of going,

00:44:30.793 --> 00:44:31.960 align:middle line:90%
what's that moving the book?

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.818 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:44:32.818 --> 00:44:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kaedrich, thanks
for being on "Beyond Belief."

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Thank you.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:36.540 align:middle line:10%
I enjoyed this, George.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.998 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Got to
get you back again.

00:44:37.998 --> 00:44:39.998 align:middle line:10%
There's way too much
material to cover with you.

00:44:39.998 --> 00:44:40.798 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Indeed.

00:44:40.798 --> 00:44:41.860 align:middle line:90%
I look forward to that.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We will
do that, indeed.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.280 align:middle line:10%
So if you think your
house is haunted,

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.830 align:middle line:10%
you want to deal with
someone like Kaedrich Olsen

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:49.720 align:middle line:10%
and get him to
come and help you.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.390 align:middle line:10%
But as he said, laugh at it.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.900 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
