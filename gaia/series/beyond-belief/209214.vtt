00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH APRIL: The
Galactic Federation of Light

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.770 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like a
universal governance system

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.630 align:middle line:84%
filled with many
different species

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.960 align:middle line:90%
from all over the universe.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Couldn't
the Galactic Federation

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.850 align:middle line:84%
just wave their
magic wand and say,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I want all these
conflicts to go away?

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It is not up to
the Galactic Federation

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.270 align:middle line:84%
to come down and save us,
because we are on our own path

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.170 align:middle line:90%
collectively.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.587 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want for us?

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: They want to get rid
of any external influences

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.170 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.690 align:middle line:84%
They want to disclose
all of the truth, all

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
of the information
about the universe,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:90%
about inter-dimensional life.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And they want to really see
what humans will do with that.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.703 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.703 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, we've got a
great show for you today,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:10%
Elizabeth April with us
channeling the Galactic

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:10%
Federation of Light.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And she's also an
intuitive psychic.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.013 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, welcome
to the program.

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Thank you so
much for having me here.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
Galactic Federation of Light?

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:10%
>>APRIL: So the Galactic
Federation of Light,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:10%
I akin it to the
UN of the planet.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a little less corrupt.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.338 align:middle line:90%
So it's basically--

00:01:17.338 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or a lot less corrupt.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: A lot less corrupt.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:10%
So it's kind of like a
universal governance system

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:10%
filled with many
different species

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:10%
from all over the
universe who really want

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:10%
to come together for unity.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And so they've been involved
with planetary agendas

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and planetary things
for quite some time.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And they really oversee all
of the different planets

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations all
around the universe,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:84%
to really help with the unity
in the universe as well.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they have clout?

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.708 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I would
say that they do.

00:01:54.708 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:84%
They do have a
force behind them,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
just because there's so
many different beings who

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:84%
are involved in the
Galactic Federation.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: So they do have--

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
they do have clout
in the universe, yes.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you realized you
had extrasensory abilities, how

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:90%
old were you?

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, so my parents
say that I was around two years

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:84%
old when they noticed that I
was, I guess, talking to things

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
and seeing things
and interacting

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.610 align:middle line:84%
with things that they couldn't
see and interact with.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of that,
for me, was clairvoyance.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of seeing things that
other people couldn't see--

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
mediumship, seeing different
spirits and entities

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
in the room, but also
seeing auras and chakras

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:90%
from a young age as well.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it come easy
to you, or was it difficult?

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It was very easy
to tap into that world.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:84%
But it was very difficult
to balance that world

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.665 align:middle line:90%
with this world.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And convey
it to others?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And convey
it to others.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I thought what I
was experiencing

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
was very normal at
that point in time,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:84%
until I got into
elementary school,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.003 align:middle line:84%
until I was the weird
kid, until I realized--

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you tell
your friends about this?

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I absolutely did.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I told them about
everything I was experiencing.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:90%
I would--

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mommy,
Elizabeth was abducted.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.340 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And I would go over
to my friend's house

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
at the age of six
and say, oh, well,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:84%
it's so nice that your
grandfather is visiting,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that he actually
passed three years prior.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.635 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And so that
was a little weird

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and created some different
situations for me at that time.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you had
an alien abduction case?

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.122 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I do, yes.

00:03:30.122 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So my first
conscious abduction-- and I

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
say that for a reason, because
this was the first time

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
that I was fully aware of the
abduction experience-- happened

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:90%
at 18 years old.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And I went away to
a 10-day silent meditation

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:90%
retreat called Vipassana.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And on the second
night of meditation,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I was abducted by
interdimensionals.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.178 align:middle line:84%
And we would describe
them as tall whites,

00:03:57.178 --> 00:03:58.095 align:middle line:90%
the tall white beings.

00:03:58.095 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Plainly so because
they're very tall and very

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
white, almost to the point
where they're transparent and--

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost ghostly looking?

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Very ghostly looking.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and creepy, actually.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Creepy looking.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a very fear
based abduction experience.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But it opened that
can of worms for me.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:84%
Not only are interdimensionals
real, but they're here,

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:90%
and they're interacting with us.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that really opened
that can of worms for me

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:84%
to question this
reality even deeper.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:90%
And who are we as human beings?

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.112 align:middle line:84%
And why are they interacting
with us at this time?

00:04:36.112 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they from
other planetary systems

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:90%
or within our own existence?

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Definitely
offworld, but I really

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
believe that species
in particular

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to do with government
in maybe a not so good way.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know too too much
about the tall whites myself

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.407 align:middle line:84%
other than that
small interaction

00:04:58.407 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:90%
that I did have with them.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they harm
you or were you scared

00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:90%
with what you can remember?

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.675 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I was definitely--

00:05:03.675 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:90%
I was very scared, yeah.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:90%
I was very--

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't blame you.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Just because I was
so thrown out of my element.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
a very beautiful,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:90%
loving species either.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't a compassionate
abduction experience.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did when
they took me is they actually

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:90%
put something in my right ear.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:90%
And I remember--

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An implant?

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Basically,
yeah, exactly.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically
a tracking device.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And after they put
me back into my bed,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I wasn't able
to remote view anymore.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I wasn't
able to astral travel

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:84%
or to tap into these other
realms because, in my mind,

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.443 align:middle line:84%
I felt like maybe
if I left my body

00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:84%
they would come
back into my body,

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that was why
that they were tracking me.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So I really had no
idea what they put in

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
or why they were wanting
to track me at that time.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the
implant still in you?

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: No, I went
to a medical medium,

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and she was able to pick
up on it right away.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And she did her
energetic magic, and she

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
was able to disconnect
it from my energy system.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lot of weird
ear drainage afterwards.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: But other than
that, I immediately felt

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:84%
like that heaviness and that
feeling of being watched

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
was lifted right after I
saw this medical medium.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whitley Strieber,
the author of "Communion"

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
has an implant near
his ear in the back.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't want
to have it removed.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
He thinks it's a connection
with his late wife

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.500 align:middle line:90%
that they implanted in him.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But Dr. Roger Leir,
Elizabeth, who

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:84%
used to remove
implants from people,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.270 align:middle line:90%
he's not with us anymore.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But he invited me
to a surgical event

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
where a lady had an
implant in her cheek.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And every time they
tried to grab it

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.390 align:middle line:84%
with the little tweezers, and
they had her slit a little bit,

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:90%
it would move.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Wow.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It escaped.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Wow.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he had to stop
or he'd mutilate her face.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Right.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he said, I couldn't
just keep poking away at her.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.420 align:middle line:90%
And she probably still has it.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:84%
These probably tracking
devices like you have.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Mm-hmm.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe some are
good and some are bad.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Just like everything in the
universe, there's that binary.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A lot of people have
talked about alien abduction

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.810 align:middle line:90%
cases.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:84%
One was Laurie
McDonald, who talked

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:90%
with us about her situation.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you continue to
have these experiences?

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LAURIE MCDONALD:
I do, actually.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:90%
But they're different now.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:10%
Now I feel that my
consciousness has expanded,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:10%
and I no longer look at
the phenomena the same way.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that any interaction
with a UFO or an alien

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:84%
isn't so much about
them, that it's more

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:90%
about the human experience.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:10%
Sort of knocked on the
door of my consciousness

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:10%
and allowed me to see that I
was more than what I thought,

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.200 align:middle line:10%
and that it opened the door
to multidimensionality,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:10%
that the soul itself
is multidimensional.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And I came to some conclusions
that some of the hybridization

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:84%
programs in particularly
with the gray--

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.860 align:middle line:84%
gray human were to
hijack our ascension,

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to hijack our ability to
move through space and time

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:90%
without a body.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And because I've had so many
out-of-body experiences--

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I've been a meditator
for over 40 years.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
I've had out-of-body
experiences.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I spent five years
at a Buddhist temple.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I learned more about
extraterrestrials

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and other worlds than
the thousand cases

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:90%
that I've worked.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
But I went there
initially because I

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
was continuously having
an out-of-body experience.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:84%
Every time I would relax,
I'd pop right out of my body

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:90%
and I could see me.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:90%
And so what did that tell me?

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It told me that I was still
Laurie without the vessel.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did you
think of that, Liz?

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I definitely
agree with a lot of that.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are
multidimensional beings.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we are
here to fully express that DNA

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and express that
multidimensionality.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I truly believe that
everyone is psychic.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has
clairvoyant abilities.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And this world is too
distracting for most people

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
to really be able to tap
in to those abilities.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, your case,
your abduction case just

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.606 align:middle line:90%
happened one time?

00:09:18.606 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:90%
Or do you think it's ongoing?

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: No.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So since then I've had
many physical interactions

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.700 align:middle line:84%
with different
interdimensional beings.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I have had many more
astral and remote interactions

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
with different
interdimensional beings

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:84%
for very specific
purposes as well.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
ever wonder why you?

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Does that ever come up?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I think
in the past, when

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of bullying and
there was a lot of hardships

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.385 align:middle line:84%
around those kind
of abilities, there

00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of questions
of like why do I have

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:90%
to suffer with being different?

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But nowadays, I really feel like
there is no question of why me,

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.590 align:middle line:90%
because I don't feel special.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm here to just
be a guide for other people

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:84%
into their own
power and abilities.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you helping
other people now?

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:06.427 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I believe so.

00:10:06.427 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to believe so.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I mean,
do you see clients?

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.658 align:middle line:90%
How do you work?

00:10:11.658 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, so I used
to have a lot of clients

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:90%
And that was really beautiful.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But I was really confined
to one person at one time.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So now I like
to teach in groups.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:90%
I have courses that I teach.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I also have my own
censorship-free membership

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:90%
platform, which is incredible.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm also writing books as well,
which helps tons of people

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't necessarily have
to show up every single time

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:90%
to help them.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you hopeful for
the future of our planet?

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Oh, I am so hopeful.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Some people call me
an over-optimist.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing
wrong with that.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, and not an
over-optimist in the way that

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm ignorant to
some of the dark--

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or naive.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Or naive to some
of the dark, shadowy aspects

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:90%
of this reality.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Because I've been there.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.520 align:middle line:90%
I've experienced it.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, upon observing
the dynamics on this planet,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I really truly believe
we are ascending.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:90%
We are raising our vibration.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
people are waking up

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and that there is a
consciousness that

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:84%
is starting to sprout within
humanity that is helping

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:84%
us get to this next level
of spiritual and physical

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:90%
evolution.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.502 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
do you think there

00:11:29.502 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:90%
are like you on this planet?

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I believe every
person on the planet

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
can get to the place where
I'm at with the abilities

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:90%
that I've experienced.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I believe everyone can do that.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.223 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without training?

00:11:43.223 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: There's definitely
training involved.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There is.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You need that.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.872 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We talked a little bit
about the Galactic Federation

00:11:49.872 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you like them?

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I do.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I do.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And once again,
not in a naive way.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe that any organization
all throughout the universe

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:90%
is not without its own faults.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately
every being who

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.210 align:middle line:84%
is a part of an organization
like the Galactic Federation

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.490 align:middle line:84%
is on their own journey
and their own mission

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.070 align:middle line:90%
of self-discovery and learning.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean that
they're perfect in any regard,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:84%
but I do truly believe
in their mission

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.760 align:middle line:84%
to unify the polarity
in the universe

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure that every
being has a fighting chance.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elizabeth,
how do we get you

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.160 align:middle line:90%
on the Galactic Federation?

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Is that conceivable?

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: You mean, how do
you get me on the ship?

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do I get
you to be a member?

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:41.908 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Oh.

00:12:41.908 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I believe that
there's actually

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.900 align:middle line:84%
a lot of Galactic
Federation alumni or members

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
who have chosen to
incarnate as human bodies,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and who are on this
planet as human beings.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.247 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you be on
this board, basically?

00:12:58.247 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
in so many ways

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm a conduit for the
information from the Galactic

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Federation.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that there
are so many individuals

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:84%
on this planet who are also
in direct or indirect contact

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:84%
with the Galactic Federation,
who are helping unify

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:90%
this planet as well.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've always heard that
there's this unwritten rule

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, where
they cannot get involved,

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:90%
that they cannot influence us.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that true?

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the Galactic
Federation has

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:84%
to abide by the
laws of the Universe

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and one of the greatest laws
that they always teach me about

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:90%
is the law of non-intervention.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically what
you're talking about.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And the law
of non-intervention

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:84%
just simply states that no being
can override another being's

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.610 align:middle line:90%
free will.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Free will is the greatest
power that we all

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
have within ourselves,
whether on planet--

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if an asteroid
were coming this way,

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.820 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't intercede
and bump it out?

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: OK, so this is where it
gets a little bit more tricky.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
There are collective
contracts for this planet.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So just like I have a contract
to be sitting here with you

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:84%
today, and that's
all predestined

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:84%
based on what we planned
for this lifetime,

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:84%
the collective of
this planet also

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
has contracts that
were predestined.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And so in
that case, if something

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:84%
were to take place that was not
in alignment with the highest

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:84%
good of the
collective, then that

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:84%
is a case where it would
go to one of the councils

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:90%
with the Galactic Federation.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:84%
They would have to talk it
over and basically decide,

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.040 align:middle line:90%
do we intervene or not?

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And if we do intervene,
what kind of effects

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
is this going to make
long term for the planet

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and is this aligned to
their highest contracts?

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's where a
lot of human beings

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.330 align:middle line:84%
don't fully understand why would
God, why would the Galactic

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Federation allow for so much
suffering on this planet?

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's a question that
I get asked all the time.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And my response to
that is, I believe

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that suffering or a
challenge, whether it

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.690 align:middle line:84%
be at an individual
or collective level,

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.960 align:middle line:84%
needs to be experienced in
order for learning and growth

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.898 align:middle line:90%
to take place.

00:15:11.898 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've been through a
lot over the last several years

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
as a planet, more so
than I can remember.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.887 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
seems to be coming

00:15:18.887 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
at us from all different
angles all the time.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Studies are showing that
people have massive anxiety.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.090 align:middle line:90%
They're under huge stress.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't the Galactic Federation
just wave their magic wand

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and say, I want all these
diseases to go away?

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I want all these
conflicts to go away?

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.477 align:middle line:90%
Why don't they do this?

00:15:39.477 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, that's
a good question.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot of
solutions that they

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
have in the form of different
technologies, even DNA

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:84%
technologies or
genetic technologies

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.780 align:middle line:84%
that they could very easily
bring to planet Earth.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a lot of
people on planet Earth

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:84%
who are conduits of
that information, that

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.430 align:middle line:84%
are bringing that
technology to planet Earth.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, this
planet has been so controlled,

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.045 align:middle line:84%
so suppressed by, say,
the powers that be,

00:16:10.045 --> 00:16:14.900 align:middle line:84%
that that technology has not
been allowed to be released.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's
happening right now

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:84%
is there's this really huge
battle that's taking place

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:84%
on the planet between the
good forces, the bad forces,

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.510 align:middle line:90%
the light and the dark.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we're seeing the
shift take place finally.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a little bit
more room and movement

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
for these solutions to
come in, but it is not

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:84%
up to the Galactic Federation
to come down and save us,

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.358 align:middle line:84%
because we are on our
own path collectively.

00:16:41.358 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's our choice.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's our destiny.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.125 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They meet sometimes all
over the universe, don't they?

00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Including the moon?

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.553 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:16:49.553 --> 00:16:50.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do they do there?

00:16:50.845 --> 00:16:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So my very first meeting
with the Galactic Federation

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:90%
happened back in 2011.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And this was shortly after
my first abduction experience

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.280 align:middle line:90%
with the tall whites.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the kind of
worm that opened for me.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was greeted
in my living room

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:84%
by a really beautiful
7-foot tall astral

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:90%
being of a Pleiadian man.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
And he came through my wall, and
he said, Elizabeth, in two days

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
time, there's going
to be a meeting.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to happen
at 2:00 AM Eastern Standard

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Time, which was my time zone.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And he said, you
have to be awake for this.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's all he said.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is crazy.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:90%
All right, I'll do it.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You should be up
listening to my radio show,

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And so two days later,
it was December 21, 2011.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.600 align:middle line:90%
I woke up at 1:00 AM.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:90%
I chugged back a huge coffee.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I was in university at the
time, so I wasn't not--

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I was very used to
pulling all nighters.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:90%
And I started to meditate.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And at 2:00 AM on the
dot, this Pleiadian man

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.407 align:middle line:84%
came back into my room and
he said, OK, follow me.

00:18:01.407 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't sure at that time
if it was going to be physical,

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.448 align:middle line:84%
if it was going to
be non-physical,

00:18:05.448 --> 00:18:08.190 align:middle line:84%
but I was very used to
remote viewing, astral

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
traveling at that point.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So when he left the room
in a non-physical body,

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I
needed to follow him

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:84%
in my non-physical
body, my astral body.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So I follow him, and
we go out and out,

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and further and further
away from the planet.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was my first time
actually astral traveling

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:90%
remote viewing off the planet.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
that was possible.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I remember looking back
at the planet thinking

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:90%
how beautiful it was.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we go
farther and farther,

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:90%
and he's going to the moon.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm, like, oh, cool.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have this
meeting on the moon.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And instead of going
to some sort of base

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:84%
or building on the moon, he
goes right into the moon.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And to my knowledge, apparently,
the moon is actually hollow.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And it is being used as
a Galactic Federation

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:90%
headquarters of sorts.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is where there
were hundreds of thousands

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
of beings who were all
inside this room in the moon.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I was taught
about what's taking place

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth, who
the human beings are,

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and who the Galactic
Federation was.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Robert
Wood had a chance

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.380 align:middle line:84%
to talk with our Emery
Smith on the Gaia show

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:84%
"Cosmic Disclosure" about
what you've just said.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Wow.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A hollow moon.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH:
There are facilities

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:84%
on the moon that a
lot of the governments

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:84%
use to have meeting places,
just in a safe remote view

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
area on the inner
part of the moon.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the moon is something
that various researchers

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and scientists have
discussed in terms

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
of it being natural
versus something

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:90%
that was created by technology.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Bob, has Bill ever spoke to
you about targeting the moon

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:90%
as a place for remote viewing?

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT WOOD: He would tell
me about his experiences

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.320 align:middle line:90%
of his life.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And, once in a
while, remote viewing

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
would be involved
as we've discussed.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But when he told
me about the moon

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:84%
he didn't say he got
it from remote viewing.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.660 align:middle line:90%
He just told me factually.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, by the
way, the moon is hollow.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's not ours, that
somebody else put it up.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.635 align:middle line:84%
And these things I
had heard of before.

00:20:11.635 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It seems to
go back and forth,

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.780 align:middle line:84%
with the scientists and
researchers saying the moon is

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.520 align:middle line:90%
real, the moon is fake.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:84%
We have a great video here
with Bill talking about that.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at it.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL: Well, first of
all, it's not your moon.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:90%
And secondly, it's not a moon.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a command center
for a region of this part

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:90%
of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't rotate.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Everybody forgets the
thing doesn't turn.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a moon.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not your moon.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a command center
with probably 25 to 35

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:84%
different civilizations
in there, all of which

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
operate out here for this
part of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And yes, some of
those people actually

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.070 align:middle line:90%
are at war with each other.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:84%
But they have
personnel living here.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Their families live here.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Their kids are getting educated.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:90%
They get young.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.480 align:middle line:90%
They get older.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.688 align:middle line:90%
They get married and married.

00:21:13.688 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a big hunk.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.563 align:middle line:90%
It's a big, big facility.

00:21:18.563 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you agree
with that, Elizabeth?

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Wow, I--

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kind of echoes
what you just said.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I had no idea anyone
else has ever said that.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty cool.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I only know what I remote view,
so that's great validation.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:90%
That resonates.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you agree with him?

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.093 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I do, yeah.

00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle line:90%
That resonates a lot.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They have meetings.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.910 align:middle line:90%
They have--

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a base.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:39.655 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Command center.

00:21:39.655 --> 00:21:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not real.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.453 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's bizarre, isn't it?

00:21:42.453 --> 00:21:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: It is bizarre.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.457 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How come you are
part of these meetings?

00:21:46.457 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: That's a good question.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.620 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I think that I chose
to come to this planet

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:84%
specifically for a reason, to
help humanity through this very

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.210 align:middle line:90%
tumultuous time.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I came
here for a reason,

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that there are
a lot of individuals like me

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:84%
who came here for a
reason, to help humanity

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.760 align:middle line:90%
through this difficult time.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever felt
scared doing this?

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How so?

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:10%
>>APRIL: When I
first started getting

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:10%
into remote viewing
and astral traveling,

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:10%
I would go to a lot of
military bases on planet Earth.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:10%
>>APRIL: And I was
really curious.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what are they doing
in these underground military

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:10%
bases, top secret?

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And fun story-- in one of the
times that I explored actually

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:84%
the base in Antarctica,
they had psychic soldiers.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So when I remote view,
I'm never usually seen

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:90%
by humans or soldiers.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they can see you.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So they
had these soldiers

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.250 align:middle line:84%
who were also remote
viewing the base,

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I guess to protect it from
remote viewers like me.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And this one ended
up seeing that I

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:84%
was going through the halls
of this Antarctic base.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.372 align:middle line:84%
And he went like
this, and he pushed.

00:23:01.372 --> 00:23:03.080 align:middle line:84%
He kicked me all the
way out of the base,

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and he proceeded to follow
me to figure out who I was,

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.907 align:middle line:84%
if I was belonging
to a government.

00:23:07.907 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why are you here?

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to pop in and out
of many different locations

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:90%
to lose him.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But that-- there's been some
moments very similar to that

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.870 align:middle line:84%
that have freaked me out a
little bit, where I'm like,

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.020 align:middle line:84%
ooh, I got into a position
where I shouldn't have been.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel
special because of this?

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: No, not at all.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I've
tapped into something

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.790 align:middle line:90%
that everyone can tap into.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe
that human beings

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:90%
have many different facets.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And at a physical
level, I believe

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:84%
we have DNA within us that
is completely untapped.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that, with
the right vibrational level,

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:53.233 align:middle line:84%
we can tap in and unlock that
DNA and step into everything

00:23:53.233 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
able to experience.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I believe everyone
can experience.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In these
meetings of the Galactic

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Federation, are their arguments?

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Are they screaming
at each other?

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: No, definitely there's
not a lot of anger or animosity

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.790 align:middle line:84%
within those meetings
or those councils,

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.310 align:middle line:84%
but absolutely there
are disagreements.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And disagreements rightfully
so because the decisions

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that they're making in
relation to planet Earth,

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and once again, intervention
or non-intervention, they

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:84%
are massive decisions
that will really

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:84%
change the trajectory
of planet Earth

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:90%
and the human beings on Earth.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.127 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they
want for us, Elizabeth?

00:24:34.127 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: That's a good question.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:84%
They want human
beings to be free.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:90%
That is the end goal.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened since
the dawning of human history

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.590 align:middle line:90%
is we haven't been free.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.050 align:middle line:84%
We've been very
manipulated and very

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:84%
taken down pathways
that have not

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.900 align:middle line:84%
been through our own volition
or our own conscious awareness.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
want to do is they

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
want to get rid of any external
influences on planet Earth.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:84%
They want to disclose
all of the truth, all

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of the information
about the universe,

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.640 align:middle line:90%
about inter-dimensional life.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And they want to really see
what humans will do with that

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and where we can go with
that newfound freedom

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.870 align:middle line:90%
and that free will.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are we getting there?

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I believe that we are.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Right now, humanity as a
collective is making a choice.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Who do we want to belong with?

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: What contracts
do we want to sign?

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And because we haven't had
our full freedom, and we

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't been
accessing our full free will,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.295 align:middle line:84%
we actually don't know
what we want collectively.

00:25:37.295 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there good and
bad that we have to pick from?

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And as a human being,
I believe that we

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.620 align:middle line:90%
are this giant experiment.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe that human beings have
been manipulated within our DNA

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.040 align:middle line:90%
throughout human history.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.630 align:middle line:84%
From what the Galactic
Federation has told me,

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:58.070 align:middle line:84%
humans are basically
a giant peace treaty.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have some of the highest
vibrational interdimensional

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:90%
beings' DNA within us.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or we're a Petri dish.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
We're a giant experiment,
but also a peace treaty.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And we have some of the lowest
vibrational DNA within us.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's up to us to choose.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And for many, many millennia
out there in the universe,

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.450 align:middle line:84%
there have been
peace treaties that

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.300 align:middle line:84%
have been signed by the
darkest and the highest

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
vibrational beings, and
they've never worked.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And so now they're thinking, if
we have this living, breathing,

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:84%
walking, talking peace treaty
as the children of these beings,

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.530 align:middle line:90%
then maybe we can get somewhere.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's up to us as a
human race to choose,

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.210 align:middle line:84%
do we want to go to
the highest vibration?

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Or do we want to work
with the lowest vibration?

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's up to us to choose.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let's
put it in perspective,

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.750 align:middle line:84%
how the Galactic Federation
might have come into being.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:90%
That was on "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> How did this
Federation come to be?

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's only one
requirement for membership.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have to clarify
that this is not

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:84%
a coherent, official,
democratic organization.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.210 align:middle line:90%
It is a mindset being.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And that means an
individual or a collective

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:23.450 align:middle line:84%
has to make themselves dedicated
to the idea of a harmonious one

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:84%
being universe that has
several individual and diverse

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.890 align:middle line:84%
properties, but
it is all oriented

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
towards this unification
process of the universe.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And once-- and you
don't even have

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:90%
to know about this Federation.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So once an individual
takes the decision

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:84%
that they want to
commit themselves

00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:01.330 align:middle line:84%
to this wonderful one
being harmonious context,

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:84%
they automatically will be
drawn into this mindset being.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the end result is
still in a process, which means

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:84%
we know we are on this
process, and it will 100%

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:90%
turn out great.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But the way it turns
out and it's played out

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:26.530 align:middle line:84%
is still up to the individual
responsibilities of everyone.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's amazing-- how
many people understand what

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.940 align:middle line:90%
this Federation is all about.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I mean, just
like what was said,

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:84%
all you have to
understand is unity.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of people initially

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:84%
believe that the Galactic
Federation is only about

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:84%
light and only about love
and only about pure source

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.540 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of
fact, they are just

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:84%
about bringing harmony
towards high vibration

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:90%
and low vibration, good and bad.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not about a
choice between either.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.640 align:middle line:84%
It's about finding the
harmony and the unity

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.800 align:middle line:90%
and the oneness within both.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are they doing
a good job doing that?

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I think they are.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that they are really
beautiful guides for us.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But I do always caution to say
that it's important to question

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:17.370 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
use our own discernment,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's really
important to understand

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that even the Galactic
Federation aren't the end

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.920 align:middle line:84%
all to be all of the
universe, but they're really

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
great guides to get us to that
place where we want to be.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have any of
the members gone rogue,

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:84%
where they tried to get involved
by themselves to do something

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:37.520 align:middle line:90%
that they shouldn't?

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, yes.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I knew it.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: There's
actually a great example

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.940 align:middle line:84%
that I just channeled
a couple of months ago.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was the Yahyel
species on planet Earth.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:90%
They're very humanoid.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And they went rogue I
think back in the '80s,

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.010 align:middle line:90%
but it's a very famous event.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.590 align:middle line:90%
And it was the Phoenix Lights.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, sure.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:00.333 align:middle line:90%
1997.

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: There you go.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:84%
That was never
supposed to happen.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.880 align:middle line:84%
That was not contracted
in humanity's plan.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: That was an individual
species that was a part

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.680 align:middle line:84%
of the Galactic Federation
that went rogue,

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.880 align:middle line:84%
that really truly believed and
felt like if they just exposed

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.812 align:middle line:84%
themselves, if they
just showed the world--

00:30:18.812 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they wanted all
these people to see this.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: They wanted all
of these people to see it

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and they thought that
deep down these people

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:28.370 align:middle line:84%
would wake up and move
into a higher vibration.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:29.578 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They didn't wake up.

00:30:29.578 --> 00:30:30.378 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:30:30.378 --> 00:30:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A few people did.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:31.895 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Exactly.

00:30:31.895 --> 00:30:32.853 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But not a lot.

00:30:32.853 --> 00:30:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And so that's
why it wasn't contracted.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Humanity wasn't at a place
to accept that at that time.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you connect
with the Federation?

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:42.290 align:middle line:90%
How do you do it now?

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.018 align:middle line:84%
So I connect through remote
viewing and astral traveling.

00:30:46.018 --> 00:30:47.060 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take too long.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.952 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dreams?

00:30:47.952 --> 00:30:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: No, not necessarily.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:49.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not dreams.

00:30:49.993 --> 00:30:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Usually,
I'm very conscious.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.680 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of me
closing my physical eyes,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:84%
opening my third
eye, leaving my body,

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.230 align:middle line:84%
going up to the giant Galactic
Federation mothership,

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and consulting with
many different councils

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.420 align:middle line:90%
that they have up there.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you there,
Elizabeth, physically or are

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:90%
you there psychically?

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Remotely.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:90%
In my astral body.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I'll
go up physically,

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:17.360 align:middle line:84%
but it takes a lot of time and
energy and effort on their part

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as my part
to get up there.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's more so
astral and remote.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.733 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they have names.

00:31:23.733 --> 00:31:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, they do.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are?

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.588 align:middle line:10%
>>APRIL: Well, there's
many different councils.

00:31:28.588 --> 00:31:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So one of the councils
that I love consulting

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:33.170 align:middle line:84%
is the Arcturian
timeline council.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean the
individual Federation members.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:36.352 align:middle line:90%
Do they have names?

00:31:36.352 --> 00:31:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Like Elizabeth has one?

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, they have names.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, one of the--

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.138 align:middle line:90%
so one of the Arcturian--

00:31:43.138 --> 00:31:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians is part of
the timeline council.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:90%
His name is G.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: G?

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Just like the letter.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, G. He said that his
name in Light language

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:55.010 align:middle line:84%
was so extreme that
there was only one

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.920 align:middle line:84%
letter he could translate it
into in the English alphabet.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another member
of the Pleiadian Security

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Council.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And his name is
Kinetic, spelt with a K.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
times, the names are

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.110 align:middle line:84%
translated from Light
language or their language.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
times, the names

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.980 align:middle line:84%
are chosen by them that are
just kind of English names

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:15.980 align:middle line:90%
that we could relate to.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
seen temper from them?

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I have not seen temper.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.340 align:middle line:90%
I have definitely seen emotion.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:84%
There have been a couple of
times where I go up to the ship

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's just
everyone's in chaos,

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and there's a timeline
that planet Earth entered

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:37.400 align:middle line:84%
into that was not supposed to
be I guess in the predictions

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.200 align:middle line:90%
or in the--

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you see concern
on them, on their faces?

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:41.553 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely, yeah.

00:32:41.553 --> 00:32:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Most of them do have emotion.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.550 align:middle line:84%
The problem with humans
interacting with them

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.820 align:middle line:84%
at a physical level is when
you're in your physical body,

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the beings don't
show emotion on their face.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So instead
of smiling or laughing

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:58.220 align:middle line:84%
or an expression of concern,
it's an energy that they hold.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So unless you're tapped
in telepathically

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:03.130 align:middle line:84%
or you're tapped into
their remote body,

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:84%
we won't be able to actually
feel what they're going through

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.510 align:middle line:90%
at an emotional level.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they argue
amongst each other?

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: They don't
necessarily argue,

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:90%
but they don't always agree.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, typically I would
say 80%, 90% of the time,

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.760 align:middle line:84%
all council members
are in agreement

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.910 align:middle line:84%
with what needs to be
done moving forward.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And every once in a
while, I'll definitely

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:29.470 align:middle line:84%
see some heated conversations
between council members,

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:90%
once again, with what to do.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they have a
message for us, Elizabeth?

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Is there some guiding force
statement they want us to know?

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yes, there is.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And that would be?

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And that would
be that everything

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:46.870 align:middle line:84%
that is taking place on planet
Earth right now at this time

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:90%
is happening for a reason.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Always has, I think.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: It always
has, but specifically

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.160 align:middle line:84%
right now because there's
so much animosity.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.470 align:middle line:90%
There's so much war.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:59.862 align:middle line:84%
There's so much polarity that
we're seeing and experiencing

00:33:59.862 --> 00:34:00.820 align:middle line:90%
and feeling as empaths.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:01.802 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And hatred.

00:34:01.802 --> 00:34:02.635 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: And hatred.

00:34:02.635 --> 00:34:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A lot of it.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.090 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: And polarity.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And so they really
need us to know

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.790 align:middle line:84%
that what's happening
and taking place

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.909 align:middle line:84%
is the dismantlement
of the old Earth.

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:16.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the breaking down
of the old 3D system

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.570 align:middle line:84%
to really build back
up this new system

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.350 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to have in place.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
we need to break down

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.679 align:middle line:90%
the political system.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We need to break down
the financial system.

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.989 align:middle line:84%
We need to break down the
religious and educational

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:33.820 align:middle line:84%
systems in order to clear
space for a new unified system

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:84%
to really take place
on planet Earth.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:39.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Knowing what you
know about the Federation,

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:43.230 align:middle line:84%
about the planets,
about the universe,

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.370 align:middle line:90%
are you happy about this?

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Are you excited
about it, our future?

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: I'm beyond excited.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.909 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when 2020
happened, I was probably

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:53.589 align:middle line:84%
the most excited person
that you would ever talk to.

00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:54.389 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Mostly because it
was finally here.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%
It was finally
happening, something

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that was affecting every single
person in the entire world,

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.570 align:middle line:84%
that was shifting them
out of the matrix, that

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:84%
was forcing them to question,
that was getting them out

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.260 align:middle line:84%
of that 9 to 5 position, so that
they had the space and the room

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and the time to
question this reality

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.990 align:middle line:90%
and essentially wake up.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that's what
we've been witnessing ever

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.730 align:middle line:90%
since 2020.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In spite of
everything we've been through.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think it's
still going to get better?

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.045 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: In fact,
because of everything

00:35:27.045 --> 00:35:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
through, I believe

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're well on our way,
well on track for unity

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.510 align:middle line:90%
consciousness on planet Earth.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that
it will get worse

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.670 align:middle line:90%
before it gets better.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've been saying
that since 2020 as well.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of people are we

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to be able to sustain this and
keep going, in your opinion?

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: In my opinion,
we are extremely powerful,

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.560 align:middle line:84%
beyond words, beyond
comprehension,

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.870 align:middle line:90%
beyond my own comprehension.

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we have access
to many different traits

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and abilities that will
get us through this.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And I believe without
reason or doubt

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.980 align:middle line:84%
that we have the
strength to persevere.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in God?

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I believe in a
different word for God,

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:84%
but yes, I believe
in a consciousness--

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A higher power.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.717 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: A higher power, a
source, I like to call it.

00:36:14.717 --> 00:36:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A divine creator.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Divine creator, yeah.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whatever it may be.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Yeah, I
do believe in that.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And why don't
you accept the word God?

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I was raised
Catholic, so there

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.970 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of questioning
that I did around Catholicism

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of understanding of
genocide and pain and murder

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.310 align:middle line:84%
that has happened
underneath the word "God."

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I think I have a
little bit of resentment

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.910 align:middle line:84%
towards that word, just
because of the heaviness

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.100 align:middle line:90%
that it has created in the past.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In a
booming stock market,

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.530 align:middle line:90%
they call it a bullish time.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Mm-hmm.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When it's bad,
they call it bearish.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.133 align:middle line:90%
Are we bullish or bearish?

00:36:56.133 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I would say we're a
little bit of both right now.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a very uncertain
time to people

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:05.360 align:middle line:84%
who are not fully tapped
in, and a very certain time

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.470 align:middle line:90%
for people who are.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could it go either way?

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: I think many
years ago it could have,

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:15.000 align:middle line:84%
but these days I do believe
that we are well on our way

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.390 align:middle line:84%
to a higher vibrational
frequency for our future.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matias de
Stefano, of course,

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.520 align:middle line:84%
talks about the Galactic
Federation often,

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and also trying to
help us from some kind

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.580 align:middle line:90%
of massive galactic war.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: So imagine
the wars we have today here

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:90%
as just one planet.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But now imagine it in a bigger
way in the whole galaxy.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.570 align:middle line:84%
What they are trying to prevent
from the future and the past

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.590 align:middle line:84%
is that we today
reach a path to within

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:84%
so we can heal the
separation of every race,

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and then we can
heal the Orion War,

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and not to look the energy
outside of us but to look God

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.100 align:middle line:90%


00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:10.030 align:middle line:84%
This war that is being
held in these three

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:13.930 align:middle line:84%
times in the fourth
dimension is calling us

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:17.290 align:middle line:84%
from every dimension to
be prepared ourselves

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:90%
not to leave it.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why a lot of people is
receiving information and data

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:84%
from other levels
of consciousness,

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:28.030 align:middle line:84%
from the Pleiadian
people, Sirian people,

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Arcturian people,
to prepare ourselves

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and our bodies,
souls, and spirit,

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.420 align:middle line:84%
so we could be centered
to love each other,

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.380 align:middle line:84%
to reunite each other,
to go through the portals

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.370 align:middle line:84%
of the ninth
dimension from within.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So in such a way,
we prevent the war

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.690 align:middle line:90%
to happen again in the future.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Then when we stop the
wars in our planet,

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.380 align:middle line:84%
so we create a fractal
of this reality

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.790 align:middle line:90%
towards every other dimension.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So if we do it well, if we do
it properly in this planet,

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:08.530 align:middle line:84%
it will be like a seed to
show to many other beings

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and other planets that
it is possible to be

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:90%
harmonious with the universe.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Our job here is to remember
that we are every perspective,

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and that the only
way you can achieve

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.065 align:middle line:84%
the ninth and eighth
dimension is from within.

00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:90%


00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why we need to know
about all these people,

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.580 align:middle line:84%
intelligent beings
around the universe,

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and why is need-- is
important to understand

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.810 align:middle line:90%
our role in the War of Orion.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:50.080 align:middle line:84%
We are the seed that
can heal the war

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.880 align:middle line:90%
in between every dimension.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:55.005 align:middle line:90%


00:39:55.005 --> 00:39:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's obviously tapped
into something, Elizabeth,

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.347 align:middle line:90%
hasn't he?

00:39:58.347 --> 00:39:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Absolutely.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.702 align:middle line:84%
And those are all
the same messages

00:40:00.702 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:84%
that I've received from
the Galactic Federation

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:84%
as well, is that if we
find peace and unity here

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:13.040 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, then we
amplify that peace and unity

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.540 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the universe.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What could be
the most important message

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.460 align:middle line:90%
they want us to grasp?

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: Well, if you're open
to it, I can always tap in

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and get information
in real time.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And how do you do that?

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: So once again,
it's just a matter

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.440 align:middle line:84%
of me closing my eyes,
opening my third eye,

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.740 align:middle line:84%
remote viewing over to
the ship, and just asking

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.540 align:middle line:84%
one of the councils
if there's anything

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:38.130 align:middle line:90%
that they want to share today.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the ship
constantly out there?

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: Yeah.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So it actually hangs out in
our solar system, just outside

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:45.390 align:middle line:90%
of Earth's atmosphere.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's always cloaked,
but it's massive.

00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's typically where
I go to receive information.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>APRIL: OK, cool.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.120 align:middle line:90%
One second.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:07.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:11.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:12.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.050 align:middle line:10%
So I went over to
my favorite council

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:19.180 align:middle line:10%
within the Galactic Federation,
who is the Pleiadian Security

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:19.980 align:middle line:10%
Council.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Consists of about
eight Pleiadian beings.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And the one being that I
mentioned before, Kinetic,

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:84%
he's the leader but not
so much of that council.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.530 align:middle line:90%
So I asked him.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, Kinetic, what
does humanity need

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.970 align:middle line:90%
to know right now at this time?

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, typically he will give
me messages for the collective

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:40.560 align:middle line:90%
in a very visual way.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.135 align:middle line:84%
Like almost like a
metaphorical way.

00:41:42.135 --> 00:41:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>APRIL: And I
think the reason why

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.710 align:middle line:84%
he does that is because
it can be interpreted

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.580 align:middle line:90%
in a variety of different ways.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the image
that he gave me.

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:57.780 align:middle line:84%
He gave me this image
of a huge ocean and one

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.210 align:middle line:84%
person, that's just a
generic person representing

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:01.380 align:middle line:90%
every person.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're on this tiny little
boat, this tiny little rowboat

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.810 align:middle line:90%
in this huge, wide ocean.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And the ocean is
stormy and tumultuous,

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.190 align:middle line:90%
and there's huge waves.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
this little tiny boat

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.530 align:middle line:84%
starts to raise above
all of the waves.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's a stormy sea
going on below the boat.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But the boat is completely
unaffected by the storm.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And the message that he was
trying to relay with that image

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.630 align:middle line:84%
is that we're in the
middle of the storm.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:32.340 align:middle line:90%
We're in the middle of polarity.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.350 align:middle line:84%
We're in the middle
of this changing

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:36.210 align:middle line:90%
energy on planet Earth.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And it is tumultuous,
and there is war,

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and there is a lot of
different sides and angles

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.180 align:middle line:90%
and anger within the people.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.560 align:middle line:90%
But it is up to us.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.620 align:middle line:84%
It is our responsibility
to raise ourselves

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:54.270 align:middle line:84%
above that polarity to not
necessarily protect ourselves

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:58.560 align:middle line:84%
from that but to create our own
reality in a higher vibration,

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.870 align:middle line:90%
to see above the storm.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
ability to do that.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And as empaths, we get
so stuck in the middle

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:12.210 align:middle line:84%
of all of the projection,
and the energy and the anger

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that's happening on the planet
that it is really up to us.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.980 align:middle line:84%
It is our responsibility to let
go of all of the projection,

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.580 align:middle line:84%
all of the distraction,
all of the mass media,

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and the questioning,
and to really

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:30.900 align:middle line:84%
understand that appreciation and
gratitude for what we do have

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and where we are
at is what's going

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:36.600 align:middle line:84%
to raise our vibration above
and beyond the lower densities

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.570 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we can do that
at an individual level,

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:46.050 align:middle line:84%
we are once again amplifying
that unity, that peaceful,

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:49.080 align:middle line:84%
that oneness, that high
vibrational frequency

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.150 align:middle line:90%
towards the rest of the planet.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we can do to help.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:56.850 align:middle line:10%
That's what we can do to give
back at an individual level.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.520 align:middle line:10%
It's not about yelling
from the rooftops.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.360 align:middle line:10%
It's not about always
saying or doing something.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's just about going
within, raising the vibration,

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:09.900 align:middle line:84%
letting go of all
of the distraction,

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and showing through
experience that we

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:16.230 align:middle line:84%
can get to a higher vibrational
place, even within the storm.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.500 align:middle line:90%

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.300 align:middle line:90%
