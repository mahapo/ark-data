00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to this edition

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:10%
We've got a great program
in store for you today.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:10%
Mark Combs with us.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:10%
He's an investigative researcher
dealing with ancient mysteries.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And the mysteries, we will
talk about on this program.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:84%
One of his books,
"End the Beginning."

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>He says he has
discovered what life was

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:90%
like before Noah's great flood.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Author Mark Combs is
fascinated with the history

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:90%
of man and biblical mysteries.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:10%
His book, "End the Beginning,"
cross-references ancient texts

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:10%
with modern science to uncover
the true events leading

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:10%
to the Flood and the reason
for mankind's destruction.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Mark explains how accepting
a completely different past

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:84%
is necessary to
understanding our future.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.602 align:middle line:90%
Today, on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, I've
got to ask you,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:84%
with a great introduction
about who you are, how did you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:90%
get involved in this?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.983 align:middle line:10%
>>MARK COMBS: This
Is something that's

00:01:14.983 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:10%
a part of my
background and study

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:10%
of things that just caught my
attention and interested me.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of the things
that are in this book

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:10%
reflect my personal
journey with regard

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:10%
to questions about
this story that I

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.230 align:middle line:10%
felt like deserved answers.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.647 align:middle line:84%
And so, I wanted to dig and
ferret out the information.

00:01:33.647 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the things
that are in this book

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
are not my personal
opinion as much

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:84%
as they are documented
research and where

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.549 align:middle line:90%
the research takes the story.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you said
something interesting too.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:90%
You said "this story."

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've always wondered if
what we read in the Bible--

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
about Noah, for example, and
that flood and everything

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
leading up to it
and afterwards--

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.567 align:middle line:90%
was merely just a story.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Well, I
think we have to keep

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:84%
in mind that the first
few chapters of the Book

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
of Genesis, as it
is presented for us,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:84%
covers a period of about
2,000 years of human history.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And the average reader could sit
down and read those 10 chapters

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.170 align:middle line:90%
in 35 to 40 minutes.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So there's not a
lot of detail there.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Most of it is overview.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:90%
But we do get some highlights.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
The story of the Flood gives
us, perhaps, the most detail.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
But even in that, it's
still a highlight.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of other
aspects of this story

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:84%
that you find in
other literature

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:90%
outside the biblical text.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have to assume that
something dramatic happened

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.690 align:middle line:90%
during that time period.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that a pretty accurate guess?

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: I think, if
we could physically

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.210 align:middle line:84%
compare the world
before the Flood

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.230 align:middle line:84%
to the world we have today, we
would see a drastic difference.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking
about a global flood,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
an extinction level

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
event that changed things
on a catastrophic level.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So obviously there's going to be
a pre-flood, post-flood drastic

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.950 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Has science caught
up with the actual date

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:10%
of this tragedy?

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:10%
This catastrophe?

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: In some areas
I think they have,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.590 align:middle line:84%
keeping in mind
that science sees

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:90%
flood regions around the world.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:84%
They don't connect them as
all being a part of the same.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And in many areas,
we date things

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:84%
according to the geology
of that specific area.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
compelling stories-- and I

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:90%
have a couple of books on this.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And many of your viewers
may have seen documentaries

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:84%
on the flood involving
the Black Sea.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a really compelling story.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it
gives us something

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:84%
to really grasp what a
catastrophic flood would

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:90%
do to a region.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.469 align:middle line:84%
So in some senses,
I think science has.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
possibilities of what

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:90%
might have caused this flood?

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: I think the
possibilities really

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
have to be something of
an external force that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.500 align:middle line:84%
affected the earth in
a catastrophic manner.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And we tried to track
that within the book.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:84%
What I ended up with wasn't
what I had in my mind

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.670 align:middle line:90%
when I started my research.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But it was where
the research led.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
And so, as I track through the
book, I'm getting into an area

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
where I didn't really
want to go initially.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's where the
research is pushing me.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's where we
take the reader.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we
talking about rain?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:90%
An asteroid?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.637 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Well, you've got, as
it's presented in the Bible,

00:04:34.637 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:90%
a mixture of a couple of things.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:10%
You've got a period of rain
that lasts for 40 days and 40

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.870 align:middle line:10%
nights and nonstop.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Tha's a lot of rain.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.200 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: That's a lot of rain.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:10%
And it causes some
problems, scientifically,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:10%
that you have to resolve.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of approach
those in the book.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.112 align:middle line:84%
Because that much rain changes
the heat in the atmosphere.

00:04:53.112 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Not only would it
flood everything,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.531 align:middle line:84%
it would basically
cook everything

00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:57.780 align:middle line:90%
within the Earth's atmosphere.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: So you have
to resolve that,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:84%
or no one is going to survive
this event, even if they

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
are in a boat that
floats with all

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.260 align:middle line:90%
their collection of animals.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect is
the Bible tells us

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.135 align:middle line:84%
that we have waters that
come from under the earth.

00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:15.732 align:middle line:84%
Well, if there's waters that
are coming from the fountains

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.940 align:middle line:84%
under the earth, how do you
get those to the surface?

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a mixture of
those two things going on

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that you have to meld into
one compelling event that

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:90%
fits together.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've put those
puzzle pieces together

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
in a way that the
reader can follow.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And are we talking
about a world-wide flood?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: A lot of
people want to speculate

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:90%
that it's a global flood.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But, George, I really
struggled with that.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.042 align:middle line:10%
The Black Sea event
is a local flood in--

00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's isolated.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.333 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: --that particular area.

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:50.220 align:middle line:10%
It's isolated.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:10%
But the Bible
presents flood waters

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:10%
that precede and
exceed more 15 cubits

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.494 align:middle line:10%
above the highest mountain.

00:05:59.494 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you start exceeding
above the highest mountain,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.486 align:middle line:84%
where do the waters
stop after them?

00:06:03.486 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, you get to the next
mountain, to the next mountain,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.735 align:middle line:90%
to the next mountain.

00:06:06.735 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Unless you put the entire
globe inside of a container,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
you can't flood it without
it being a global flood.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of where I
was backed into that corner.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:90%
This is a global flood event.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.264 align:middle line:84%
And it really can't
be seen any other way.

00:06:23.264 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark,
prior to the Flood,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.499 align:middle line:90%
what's the planet look like?

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: I think,
prior to the Flood,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.190 align:middle line:84%
we've got an interesting
planet from the aspect

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of its inhabitants and
also from the aspect

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:90%
of its geological composition.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And as far as the
inhabitants are concerned,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot of people
who would speculate

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that, in ancient times, there's
a very sparse population living

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:90%
in a very unorganized manner.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
But I think we can
see, through really

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
looking at details, that
this covers a period of time

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning
up to the Flood

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.960 align:middle line:90%
itself of over 1,600 years.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:10%
And the first command that's
given to Adam and to Eve,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.823 align:middle line:10%
if we want to start with them--

00:07:08.823 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's going way back.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: The first command
is, be fruitful and multiply.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:10%
So where can our population go
over a period of 1,600 years?

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I think you've got a
thriving population.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Our country just
celebrated, I think,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
it's 240th anniversary
as a country.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Our population in the United
States is over 320 million.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So to think that the population
of the ancient world,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:84%
over a period of 1,650 years
didn't grow exponentially

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:84%
to a large thriving population
is nothing short of nonsense.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:84%
The other thing-- and
this is where I really

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
dug in on the scientific
end with the work

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:90%
of several geologists.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.040 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is the
aspect of the composition

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient world.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
different planet.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And we researched the works
of Alfred Wegener, who's

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:84%
probably most famous
for his proposal

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.510 align:middle line:90%
of the theory of Pangea.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:10%
And continental drift
grew out of that.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:10%
There's also--

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And you
can see that happen.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:90%
When you--

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: Oh, absolutely!

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --move those continents
back in, it fits like a glove.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: It fits very well.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But there were two
other geologists

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.990 align:middle line:84%
that liked his ideas
so much that they

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:90%
began to research deeper.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:90%
One was out of Australia.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.620 align:middle line:90%
His name is Samuel Warren Carey.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.350 align:middle line:90%
The other one's out of Germany.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:84%
His name is Ott
Christoph Hilgenberg.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
his work was never

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:84%
translated into any other
language other than German.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So I've just been able to
read commentaries of his work.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.272 align:middle line:84%
But both he and Carey worked
independent of each other.

00:08:45.272 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know about
each other's work.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.220 align:middle line:84%
They both came to
the same conclusion

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that, if you take the
oceans out of the way,

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
that the entire
planet would shrink

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and everything would fit
together on a much smaller--

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: --planet.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that science
has done on the heels of this

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:84%
is they have mapped the geologic
formations of the seabed floor,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean floor.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
you can Google,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.260 align:middle line:84%
just ocean floor ages or the
crust of the ocean, the ages.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get maps
that will tell you

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that the crust close to
the continental shelves

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
is very much older
than the crust that

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:90%
is closer to our trenches.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And you have to look
at that and go, OK.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
How can we see a progression
from a very recent crust here

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:84%
near the trenches,
near the deepest parts,

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to a crust that has been
around for a lot longer?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.490 align:middle line:84%
If you slowly just
kind of remove

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that crust little by little,
the entire planet shrinks.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Shrinks.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: And this is what--

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost by
half, I would guess.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.069 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: Almost by half.

00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Almost by 50%.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is what these two
geologists were tracking on.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It's more properly known as
the Expanding Earths Theory.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it the
Growing Earth Theory.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:84%
But Samuel Warren
Carey even weighed in

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
as to how it would affect
everything else on the Earth,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.510 align:middle line:84%
including the Earth's
atmosphere and climate,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.205 align:middle line:84%
which we know was, at one time,
much richer in oxygen content.

00:10:16.205 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:84%
It would affect the
flora and the fauna.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.710 align:middle line:84%
We know that we have
animals in ancient times

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
where-- we have fossils
where not only mammals

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.670 align:middle line:84%
but also insects are many
times larger than what

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:90%
we have in the world today.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said it would also
affect the dinosaurs, as far

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
as their ability to grow
to such enormous sizes.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
If you had a smaller earth,
things could grow larger.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
The larger the earth
comes, things change.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.349 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smaller.

00:10:42.349 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: And everything's
affected by that.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did
the Flood occur?

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: The Flood,
according to the scriptures

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and the other texts
that I'm able to dig up,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:84%
occurred approximately 1,650
years after the creation event

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:90%
in the Garden of Eden.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you try to track
that along the lines of, OK,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:90%
when was that BC?

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:90%
What day can we go to?

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: We're
probably going back

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:84%
into a range of
around 2,300 to-- I'm

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:90%
going to say-- 2,900 BC.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we're talking
about 5,000 years.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: About 5,000 years.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason the BC
years are difficult to date

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:84%
is because of the
structure of everything

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
was dated by rulers, who this
ruler was ruling in this time

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Another was ruling in
another time period.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a
clear-cut calendar.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of scholars
who deal specifically

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And they can't come to
a unified conclusion.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood, of course, has tried
to depict the flood of Noah

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and what Noah tried to do.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%

-We built it to the
actual scope that's

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle line:10%
described in the Bible,
which is actually

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:10%
a pretty impressive size ship.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:10%
Movies don't really build
things like this anymore.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:10%
-We've been designing
the Ark for over a year.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.326 align:middle line:10%
It took us six months to
build and to complete.

00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:10.180 align:middle line:10%
The scaffolding you see right
here is what was used by Noah

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:10%
and his family to
apply the pitch.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:10%
The pitch is all of this tar
and straw and sticks and leaves

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:10%
that were used to seal the Ark.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:10%
The idea being
that it was really

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:10%
made with what was around.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:10%
-Did you see He made the forest
to give us wood for the Ark?

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:10%
How he sent the birds?

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:10%
Has He not sent
everything we need?

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:10%
-At the bottom of the
Ark, we have our ballast.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:10%
This ballast goes
down another 15 feet.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:10%
The ballast is volcanic rock
to keep it from rolling around

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:10%
in the ocean.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:10%
The ramp with there
to serve one function,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:10%
for reptiles to be
able to get up there,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.355 align:middle line:10%
for mammals to be
able to get in here,

00:12:50.355 --> 00:12:52.659 align:middle line:10%
and birds to fly up to the top.

got a difficult time

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
comprehending that all these
animals would get onto an ark.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: That is one of
the cornerstone questions

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.390 align:middle line:84%
that those who are critical
of the story bring up.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not only the question of
the animals getting on the Ark.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.610 align:middle line:84%
It's also the
question of, how do

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:84%
you preserve all of
the species of animals

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.809 align:middle line:84%
that we have in
the world today--

>>NOORY: You can't-- it can't--

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.914 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: --in a space that size?

00:13:24.914 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Ark can't
be that big for that.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Well, and I
have to agree with that.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the structure that we just
saw is an enormous structure.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
Ark was enormous.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I do like the fact that this was
built in the shape of a box as

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.419 align:middle line:90%
opposed to the shape of a boat.

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:42.960 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember, the Ark
wasn't designed to go anywhere.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:90%
It was just designed to float.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that there
were ballast stones.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And they did highlight
that in the story.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.060 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
things that I researched

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that I think played an
important part of making the Ark

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:90%
seaworthy and steady.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the animals,
most folks or most researchers

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.480 align:middle line:84%
will tell you, we
have in excess of 1

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 million different
species of animals

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle line:90%
in our world today.

were kind to us--

to someone trying to sort out
this issue, and we came to them

00:14:19.286 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and we said, but Noah didn't
have to preserve all the sea

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
life, the mollusks, the
insects, this, this, this--

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and they were kind,
and they said,

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.751 align:middle line:84%
you know what, let's reduce
that all the way down

00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:30.977 align:middle line:84%
to 500,000 different
species of animals,

00:14:30.977 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:90%
how do you get those on the Ark?

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it just
doesn't make sense.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: You sit down
and do the math, George,

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:84%
that's over 71,000-- if you were
going to load it in a week's

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
time, it's over 71,000 pairs
of animals in a 24-hour period.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
It's over 3,000 pairs
of animals per hour.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It's over 50 pairs of
animals per minute.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It's over one pair going into
the Ark per second every second

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:84%
of every minute of every
hour of every day for seven

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:90%
straight days.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And who's--

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.541 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: It just
collapses the story.

00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who's going to
feed them for 40 days?

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Well, you do
have the zookeepers that

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:90%
have to keep them going, right?

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
But this is what collapses the
story for a lot of skeptics.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And part of the thing
there is that they

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.770 align:middle line:84%
are looking for reasons to
be critical of the story,

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:84%
not exactly to resolve the
issues that present challenges

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:90%
for the story.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.709 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things that I really

00:15:26.709 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:90%
wanted to do with.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to be fair
with those questions.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So we had to sit down
and look at the animal

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:90%
kingdom in detail.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And just to give
a short example,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
the World Canine Association
recognizes in excess

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:90%
of 340 breeds of animals today.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.690 align:middle line:84%
The American Kennel
Club, I think,

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:90%
only recognizes about 170.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But we've got all kinds of
different breeds of dogs.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.334 align:middle line:84%
We've even got designer
dogs like Labradoodles--

00:15:52.334 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: --and Cockapoos.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:90%
My neighbor has a dog, George.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It's part Labrador
Retriever and part Beagle.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
a Beagador or a Lable.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Haha.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: I'm not
sure what it is.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:90%
But it's weird.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.404 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a Labrador
down to the body.

00:16:07.404 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little one.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: And then, it's-- no!

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.640 align:middle line:10%
Its full-size.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it?

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.666 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: And it has legs that
are about eight inches long.

00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:10%
It's a strange,
strange looking animal.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:90%
But these are designer animals.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
But they will tell us that
every single breed of dog

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.290 align:middle line:84%
in the world today can be
tracked back to a gray wolf

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:90%
approximately 15,000 years ago.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, that leads to
a simple question.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Does Noah need to save every
Dotson, every German Shepherd,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.194 align:middle line:90%
and every Labrador Retriever?

00:16:38.194 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Or does he need to get two--

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just one.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: --grey wolves?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: These are
the types of questions

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that the skeptics will
not ask, because they want

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.720 align:middle line:90%
to be critical of the story.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to try to find
responsible science that

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
can maybe provide some
resolution for questions

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.880 align:middle line:84%
that I think are
legitimate questions.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.421 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
found that science?

00:16:56.421 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: I think, in a
lot of cases, we have.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:90%
We look at that.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
I spent an entire
chapter on that

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and tried to make it
an entertaining chapter

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:90%
as we went through.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But spent an entire chapter
on that type of thing,

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:84%
because the one thing that we
know is that species do change,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.630 align:middle line:84%
especially as they get
isolated into different regions

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:90%
in different climates.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:84%
They undergo a change
over a period of time.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.430 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how long does
it take to enact that change?

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, how long did it take us
to get from a handful of dog

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:90%
breeds to in excess of 340?

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Less than 200 years.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark, describe
for me the size of the Ark?

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.770 align:middle line:84%
The size of the ark
that Noah built?

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: This was something
that astounded me.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.204 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a starting
point in the book.

00:17:43.204 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
It's probably my least
favorite chapter.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But I felt like the Ark
is a central character,

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.490 align:middle line:90%
as far as this story goes.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:90%
How big is this structure?

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And what we wanted
to try to break down

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.720 align:middle line:84%
was something so that the
reader could put themselves

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
inside the footprint of the Ark,
regardless of where they were.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm a very visual person.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And I can imagine how
big a gallon of milk is

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:90%
or how big a barbecue pit is.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Something like this,
I really didn't have

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.190 align:middle line:90%
any type of a reference point.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I did, I
realized that most parking lots

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:90%
are lined-- excuse me.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And the measurements on
those are exact measurements.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So I can kind of trust those
as far as walking it off.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to walk off
the size of the Ark, which

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe was approximately
500 foot in length

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.315 align:middle line:90%
and about 85 foot in width.

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You did that
in a parking lot?

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.280 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: The first parking
lot I went to was too small.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I had to go find
another parking lot.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it was huge.

00:18:42.735 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: And we found
another parking lot that

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:90%
was out in front of a theater.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost long enough
and certainly wide enough.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, I wanted to
get something as far

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:90%
as the height of the Ark.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.195 align:middle line:90%
How tall was this?

00:18:55.195 --> 00:18:57.820 align:middle line:84%
The structure that were given
according to the scriptures

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:90%
is in excess of 50 feet.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So I stood in front
of the theater

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.029 align:middle line:84%
where it has the big
structures coming up,

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:06.070 align:middle line:90%
shooting up into the air.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I had my wife take
a picture of me.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:10%
And when I got home--
I'm six foot tall,

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:10%
almost and even
six foot-- I took

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:10%
and I photoshopped myself and
just stacked myself on top.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.544 align:middle line:10%
And I got--

00:19:16.544 --> 00:19:18.460 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Took about eight
or nine of you, huh?

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.418 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: It would have.

00:19:19.418 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:10%
But at six, I ran
out a building.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:10%
This building that I
thought was incredibly tall

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:10%
was about 15 feet short of what
the actual height of the Ark

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.060 align:middle line:10%
would have been.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So this was an
enormous structure.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, to give people
a better perspective of what

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:84%
the Ark looked like
in terms of size,

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
let's compare it to some of the
objects that are on the planet

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.232 align:middle line:90%

constructed in the third
century BC by Ptolemy the first.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
It stood for 1,700 years
until its structure

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:90%
was ruined by earthquakes.

ancient existing structures

in all the world.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.630 align:middle line:84%

of the length of the

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I've also found some
things that suggest

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.491 align:middle line:90%
they were given over 100 years.

00:20:47.491 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But to me, if you take a span
of 100 years to build something,

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:84%
you've also got-- what
I built 98 years ago,

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:84%
is it starting to
deteriorate and now I'm

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
having to repair
that versus-- I think

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.240 align:middle line:84%
was probably built in a span
of about four or five years.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know
the Ark even is real?

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:90%
And where is it?

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Oh well, I think it
was, at one point, on Ararat.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
There's been some geological
disturbances in the area there

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:84%
that have really changed the
landscape of the mountain.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:90%
But I think it was real.

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.500 align:middle line:90%
I think it still is real.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a more difficult find
today for a number of reasons.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:10%
But there's a lot of
historical stories

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:10%
of people who have encountered
it, seen it, and documented it

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:35.900 align:middle line:10%
over the last 200 or so years,
which is a modern time frame.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
stories are documented

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
in a book called "Noah's
Ark, Fact or Fable?"

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
that was authored
by Violet Cummings.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:90%
The book's out of print now.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.510 align:middle line:84%
But it really does present
some of these things

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
that you won't
find anywhere else.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really nice
little volume to have.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:84%
About 140 years ago, there
was a tremendous earthquake

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:90%
in the area.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.226 align:middle line:90%
The mountain is in Armenia.

00:21:58.226 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
There was a
tremendous earthquake

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
in the area which
destroyed a portion

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:84%
of that mountain and an
area known as Ahora Gorge.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.005 align:middle line:84%
That's the area where the
Ark was in, generally.

00:22:08.005 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: According
to the Bible, right?

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.795 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Well, the Bible does
say it was in the mountains

00:22:11.795 --> 00:22:12.120 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of Ararat.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.860 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: And the ancient writers
in that 1st century to 200 BC

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:10%
range-- in that 300 year range--
they all refer to this boat--

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.030 align:middle line:10%
those who write about it--
as being an area of mountains

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:27.905 align:middle line:10%
that's in Armenia.

00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:29.905 align:middle line:84%
Which is the same area
that the Bible specifies.

00:22:29.905 --> 00:22:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Under ice?

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: It was under ice in
our more modern-day times.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:84%
That mountain range,
in the climate

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that it's in-- under ice
portions of the year,

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
exposed during
portions of the year.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.560 align:middle line:84%
The earthquake that
happened a number of years

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:84%
ago really destroyed a large
portion of the mountain,

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:84%
including a small
monastery that was

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.870 align:middle line:84%
there that did have
some display, kind of

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:90%
like a mini museum of the Ark.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.190 align:middle line:90%
And we're talking 150 years ago.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, there's a lot
of documentation on that.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've seen pictures,
historical pictures,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.250 align:middle line:84%
of areas that could look
like there was an ark there,

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:90%
petrified.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.975 align:middle line:10%
Astronauts have been obsessed
with finding the Ark.

00:23:10.975 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: James Irwin.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.106 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: Almost lost his life on
the mountain searching for it.

00:23:15.106 --> 00:23:15.989 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:23:15.989 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And wasn't there some
kind of space shuttle

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:90%
picture of that region.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: There's been a number
of different radar pictures

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.780 align:middle line:84%
by flyovers and, then, I think
some from satellite imagery

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:90%
and things of that nature.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.217 align:middle line:84%
I have some friends who were
on the mountain in 2013,

00:23:31.217 --> 00:23:32.017 align:middle line:90%
archaeologists.

00:23:32.017 --> 00:23:32.831 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: Bruce--

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it safe there still?

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: It's really
a political hot zone.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:84%
They won't even let expeditions
in, as of right now.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah!

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.596 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: They haven't let
expeditions in since 2015.

00:23:41.596 --> 00:23:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Its with the
Kurds and people like that?

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: Yeah, PKK.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:84%
You go over there, you're
basically putting your life

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:90%
in your own hands.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's not safe.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not safe.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: But they were
on the mountain in 2013.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.216 align:middle line:84%
And I got a lot of
information from them

00:23:55.216 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:90%
as I was working on things.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
They really helped me understand
the mountain and the area,

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.820 align:middle line:90%
very detailed in their work.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what's
so important to this--

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.249 align:middle line:84%
and I have always
thought about this

00:24:07.249 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:84%
since I was a little
boy fascinated

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:84%
with the subject-- was that,
if the Ark is ever discovered,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that to me then is proof
that the rest of the Bible

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:90%
could be very real and accurate.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
so amazing to me.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.693 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Well, that's
one of the things that

00:24:23.693 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:84%
drew me to this story, because
it's such a polarizing story.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:84%
You've got people that
accept it on blind faith.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:84%
You got other people that are
critical to the point of just

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.890 align:middle line:90%
wanting to take pot shots at it.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:90%
And let's be honest.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to do that.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But if this story is
true, like you said,

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:90%
it's a history-changing story.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge!

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: It changes everything.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So to say this is
a game-changer,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
game-changer in many ways.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.620 align:middle line:84%
But now we're at the point
where, in our modern day,

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:84%
we want to dismiss it,
scoff at it, or say,

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it's just one of those old
fables that they used to tell.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
lot of things that

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:84%
point to it as being an
actual event and a true story.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what's
amazing about all of us

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:middle line:84%
is-- let's take God out of
the picture for a moment.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: OK.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did Noah know
about building an ark that

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.141 align:middle line:90%
took-- how long to build?

00:25:13.141 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: I think it was built
in a four to five year period.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK, four to five years.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.870 align:middle line:10%
Tell a story of
some calamity that

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.340 align:middle line:10%
was going to occur
on the planet,

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.510 align:middle line:10%
whether it was an asteroid, a
flood, or whatever happened--

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:10%
how did he know this?

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: That's a
really good question.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.410 align:middle line:84%
You saw in the movie that we've
had the clip from earlier,

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:84%
the movie "Noah," that
Russell Crowe plays

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:90%
the character of Noah.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:90%
And God spoke to him in dreams.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And we see several
places in the Bible

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
where God speaks to
people in dreams.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.180 align:middle line:84%
He spoke to Joseph, who
was in Egypt, via dreams.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.010 align:middle line:84%
He spoke to Daniel,
who was in Babylon.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.490 align:middle line:84%
He even spoke to Nebuchadnezzar,
the King of Babylon,

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:90%
through his dreams.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.580 align:middle line:84%
But we also see
in places where He

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:84%
spoke to people
directly, not only some

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.670 align:middle line:84%
of the prophets such as the
prophet Samuel, the prophet

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah, the prophet
Isaiah, and others,

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:90%
but also, prior to the Flood.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Adam-- it says he walked
in the garden with Adam.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.830 align:middle line:90%
It says Enoch walked with God.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:90%
And God spoke with him.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Enoch says that,
from the time Noah was born,

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:84%
he conversed with
the Lord of Spirits.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think He spoke
with Noah directly.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think, from the
time Noah was born,

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.750 align:middle line:84%
he was being prepared
for this specific task.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What if-- now,
this is far-fetched.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: OK, I love far-fetched.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What if a group
of extraterrestrials

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.350 align:middle line:10%
came down to the planet,
pinpointed someone like Noah,

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:10%
gave him a five year
head-start, and said,

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.030 align:middle line:10%
an asteroid is coming this way.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:90%
It's going to hit the water.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It's going to create the biggest
flood this planet has ever

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:90%
seen.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.780 align:middle line:84%
You need to get
prepared for that.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.039 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: I think it's possible.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But I think it has
a couple of areas

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:84%
where it's really lacking,
as far as underlying purpose.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.910 align:middle line:84%
The Bible and ancient
literature present

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:08.435 align:middle line:84%
this extinction-level
event as a judgement.

00:27:08.435 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm, a cleansing.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: Even in the
works of Zechariah--

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sitchin.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: --Sitchin,
it's presented

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.790 align:middle line:10%
as a judgement of the gods.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, he uses the alien
influence of the Anunnaki.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:84%
As you study a lot of
these ancient texts--

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and there are
scholars that do, that

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:30.820 align:middle line:84%
study the cuneiform
tablets, the Sumerian story,

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:84%
the Babylonian story, the
Akkadian and Assyrian story.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.514 align:middle line:90%
They study them in detail.

00:27:35.514 --> 00:27:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And they try to
put them together.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:42.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the most enriching
productions on this

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.360 align:middle line:84%
was by a gentleman
named Amar Annus.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote the story of
"The Origin of the Watchers."

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It's about a 45-page
scholarly document.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's really heady stuff.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But he takes in all these
different cultures and all

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:84%
of their different
influences and dovetails them

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:84%
all together into a story that
actually makes sense in the way

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:90%
that it presents things.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.524 align:middle line:84%
I do think we have
an alien influence.

00:28:08.524 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
it's extraterrestrial.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's
interdimensional.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.859 align:middle line:84%
I believe the Watchers
were spiritual beings.

00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I think they were
interdimensional beings--

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
still an amazing story.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: It is an amazing story.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that we,
in our modern-day world,

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:90%
just can't comprehend.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And not necessarily
do we really want to.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.970 align:middle line:90%
We like dealing flesh and blood.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And we've got enough problems
that we've created on our own,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.340 align:middle line:90%
don't we?

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So one of
the questions, Mark,

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.560 align:middle line:90%
is how did this story evolve?

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.956 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:28:36.956 --> 00:28:37.800 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:10%
-When you're telling the story
of the beginnings of humanity,

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:10%
the Flood story is
part of that story.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:10%
-Without this
moment of the Flood,

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:10%
you have no framework
within which

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:10%
humans can develop the life that
will permit their perpetuity.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.214 align:middle line:90%
You have to have it there.

00:28:56.214 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:84%
-But why is a defining
moral tale in the Bible,

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.930 align:middle line:84%
forged in the desert
hills of Judeo,

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.280 align:middle line:90%
shaped by a flood and a ship?

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.545 align:middle line:84%
Where did its
authors get the idea?

00:29:10.545 --> 00:29:11.420 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So Mark, that's
the $64,000 question.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.450 align:middle line:90%
How did this story come about?

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, did somebody concoct it?

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Was there a good
storyteller in that day?

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.366 align:middle line:90%
Or did this really happen?

00:29:23.366 --> 00:29:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: I think it's
a valid question.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:29.090 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that there are
aspects of this story embedded

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:84%
in flood legends from every
culture around the world,

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of flood legends.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, these stories
date back, yes,

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient times
of Babylon, Egypt,

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.510 align:middle line:90%
Assyria, and other cultures.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So these aren't
modern-day stories.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.670 align:middle line:90%
They're ancient stories.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're embedded
in every single culture

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.650 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And they do carry a lot
of common themes in them.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Some of the common themes being
that the Earth was completely

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:84%
destroyed, that it was preserved
through the work of one

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:84%
man and his family, that the
life of the animal kingdom

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.820 align:middle line:90%
was preserved along with it.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.270 align:middle line:84%
But also, that it was a
judgment from a supreme being.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.420 align:middle line:90%
All of those are factored in.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.430 align:middle line:84%
There's another
thing that's in a lot

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:90%
of these legendary stories.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Almost half of them,
just shy of 40%,

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.730 align:middle line:84%
include an enormous
object in the sky.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.830 align:middle line:84%
You won't see that
in the scriptures.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.629 align:middle line:84%
You won't see that in a
lot of other literature.

00:30:26.629 --> 00:30:28.420 align:middle line:84%
But you will see that
in the flood legends.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:90%
You do see it in the--

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
an asteroid to me.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.328 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: You do see it
in the "Book of Jasher."

00:30:32.328 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like an asteroid or
possibly even something larger.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:84%
As I began to research it,
I think it's absolutely

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.620 align:middle line:90%
something larger.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think the documented
evidence points to it

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:46.120 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I don't think
God was really as evil

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.750 align:middle line:90%
as Genesis projected Him to be.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.280 align:middle line:84%
A god who would come and
want to cleanse the planet

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and eradicate it
from all these people

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to get rid of,
doesn't make a lot of sense

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I think some
of these ancients

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.060 align:middle line:84%
had these events
occurr-- they're real.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Again, I get back to the
asteroid hit the planet.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was a
planet-killer-- and had

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.620 align:middle line:84%
to come up with a story
that made sense to them.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And that was, the gods did
this to us, because we were bad

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.380 align:middle line:90%
and we were evil.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.500 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think there
was a god that would

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.230 align:middle line:90%
wipe our all these people.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Because they couldn't
all have been bad.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Well, that's an
interesting question as it

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.730 align:middle line:84%
comes up, not only the people,
but also the rest of creation.

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.140 align:middle line:90%
What did the giraffe do?

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Did he eat from the
wrong tree as well?

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've got everything, an
extinction-level event going on

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:44.230 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
do present this story

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:84%
as if it has everything to do
with the evilness of mankind.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, but just
because Bob and Curly-Sue

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:84%
got a little out
of hand, I don't

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:84%
think that's a reason
to wipe out the planet.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:00.197 align:middle line:84%
I think there's something
much deeper going on here.

00:32:00.197 --> 00:32:00.996 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:00.996 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: And that's
one of the questions

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to try and track
through the entire storyline.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
underlying question.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Is God just angry
and evil and decides

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.420 align:middle line:84%
to throw a temper-tantrum
and destroy the planet?

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Or is God justified
in what he does?

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Is the destruction of
the planet the only way

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:90%
to preserve life going forward?

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of the documentation

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
would point us toward
that second alternative.

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or maybe God had
nothing to do with it.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was a calamity, a
catastrophe, an earth-changer,

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:84%
that was going to
occur regardless.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: I think
it was something

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.240 align:middle line:90%
that was going to occur.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I do think it was
definitely Earth-changing.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.500 align:middle line:84%
We see that portrayed
in all of the cultures.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:84%
My own perspective,
from the studies

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that I've done, from the
materials that I've pulled,

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I can't pull God
out of the story.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I just can't.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.820 align:middle line:84%
I think part of it that keeps
Him attached to the story

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.940 align:middle line:84%
is that this is His
original creation that He's

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.330 align:middle line:90%
responsible for.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.760 align:middle line:84%
He's the agent that put it all
in place in the first place.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And in these actions,
He's also the agent

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:84%
that is preserving it, for
a time that's yet future.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.375 align:middle line:90%
And we say preserving it.

00:33:23.375 --> 00:33:26.700 align:middle line:84%
We are setting it aside for
something that's yet to come.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As you look at
this entire scenario,

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.040 align:middle line:84%
this very strange
scenario, what have you

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.540 align:middle line:84%
concluded just
with your own work?

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: I think that
the time that we see

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:84%
points to a very specific
event that happened

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.670 align:middle line:90%
for a very specific reason.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the first century,
you have Christ who people

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:50.400 align:middle line:90%
regard in different ways.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Is he a great teacher?

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Was he deity?

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Was he this?

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Was he that?

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have the
preserved words of Christ.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that he did

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:84%
say-- regardless of
what a person may

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.990 align:middle line:84%
think of who he actually
is-- one of the things

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that we have on
record is he said,

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:11.939 align:middle line:84%
as it was in the days of
Noah, so shall it be in a day

00:34:11.939 --> 00:34:13.060 align:middle line:90%
yet future.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So from my perspective, those
two things are tied together.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.710 align:middle line:90%
And I can't do that knot.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.449 align:middle line:84%
Because we're told
that an event that

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:25.070 align:middle line:84%
happened in the past
foretells, foreshadows,

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:29.795 align:middle line:84%
points to, and outlines an event
that is coming in the future.

00:34:29.795 --> 00:34:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think
it might repeat itself?

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:34.003 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: I think it's definitely
going to repeat itself,

00:34:34.003 --> 00:34:36.679 align:middle line:10%
not in the way of a flood,
but in something else that's

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.550 align:middle line:10%
also very devastating.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:41.940 align:middle line:84%
When Christ made that
statement, he said, men's hearts

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.350 align:middle line:84%
would fail them for fear for the
things coming upon the Earth.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.630 align:middle line:84%
That the powers in the
heavens would be shaken.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.050 align:middle line:84%
That the stars would
fall from the sky.

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.780 align:middle line:10%
I take that to be meteors
rather than-- I mean, we know--

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:54.155 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Something.

00:34:54.155 --> 00:34:54.530 align:middle line:10%
Objects.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.446 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: We know the
stars are something else.

00:34:56.446 --> 00:34:58.610 align:middle line:10%
But we, even today,
refer to them

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:10%
as shooting stars when we see--
tshh-- the little meteor trail.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:07.040 align:middle line:84%
But he said, the moon and the
sun would not give their light.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.790 align:middle line:84%
The Old Testament prophets--
Amos writes, in Amos Chapter 8,

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.550 align:middle line:84%
that I will cause the sun
to go down at noonday.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Zachariah says it
won't be light or dark.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It will be that
in-between twilight

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that we experience at
the poles, if you've ever

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.130 align:middle line:84%
been to Alaska or
some of these places

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:24.900 align:middle line:84%
where they don't
quite ever get dark

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and they don't quite
ever get fully lit.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.614 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
the city of Jerusalem.

00:35:30.614 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
writing about.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying, there
is coming a time when

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.540 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be like that.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.150 align:middle line:90%
The sun will go down at noonday.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:39.802 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
twilight not bright light.

00:35:39.802 --> 00:35:41.510 align:middle line:84%
That's what the prophets
are pointing to.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what Christ
is alluding to as well.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If Genesis did
not talk about Noah,

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.320 align:middle line:90%
would we even know about this?

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.490 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: I think we would have
stories from other cultures.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:54.360 align:middle line:84%
The Babylonians
have their story.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.942 align:middle line:90%
The Greeks, theirs.

00:35:55.942 --> 00:35:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost
like there's--

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: So there's a lot
of things-- the Sumerians.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things
that are preserved for us.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think we'd have a
concept of the story.

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I think the Hebrews, when
they put this together--

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and I do feel like this
portion was put together

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.480 align:middle line:84%
after the Babylonian
captivity, which

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.740 align:middle line:84%
would have put it
somewhere around the time

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.480 align:middle line:90%
period of 500 to 550 BC.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
were putting it together

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:22.800 align:middle line:84%
to take some of the prevailing
thoughts and correct them.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the prevailing thoughts
did not have the Creator

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.680 align:middle line:90%
involved.

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And from their
perspective, this story

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:middle line:84%
can't be told without the
one who created it also

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.530 align:middle line:90%
being the one who destroyed it.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.887 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's what you get
from the Hebrew perspective.

00:36:37.887 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a
few e-mails in for you.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: OK.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gina, from
Tallahassee, Florida.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Were there really two of
every animal on the Ark?

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.000 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.291 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: It is a good question.

00:36:47.291 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's something
that, in our own minds,

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:84%
we've kind of missed what the
Bible tells us about this.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I not only looked
at it in the text

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that most people
would read, I also

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.910 align:middle line:84%
looked at it in a test
called the Septuagint, which

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.370 align:middle line:84%
is a Greek version of
the Old Testament, which

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.550 align:middle line:84%
would have been what
Jesus and disciples would

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.660 align:middle line:90%
have been reading in their day.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:10.430 align:middle line:84%
The text, it comes to us
from Genesis 7, verse 2.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And it tells us that
of the clean animals,

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:84%
he took a male and the
female, seven pairs.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.650 align:middle line:90%
We read that.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And because seven
is an odd number,

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:21.520 align:middle line:90%
we immediately think 14.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, it says the same thing
about the unclean animals.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.616 align:middle line:84%
It says of the unclean
animals, take the male

00:37:26.616 --> 00:37:27.656 align:middle line:90%
and his female, two pair.

00:37:27.656 --> 00:37:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
an unclean animal?

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:30.610 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: That comes
to us, I think,

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:31.910 align:middle line:10%
from the Book of Leviticus.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:36.270 align:middle line:10%
We kind of get a
definition of that there.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it's a definition
that's given there.

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But it predates the writing of
Leviticus by a number of years.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But what is it?

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Clean
animals were animals

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:49.170 align:middle line:84%
that could be taken as
food and animals that

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.680 align:middle line:90%
could be used to sacrifice.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Unclean animals were animals
that were fit for neither.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like snakes
and things like that?

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.141 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: Things of that nature.

00:37:56.141 --> 00:37:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Also, as you go through
the list in Leviticus,

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.680 align:middle line:84%
you've got things
such as anything that

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.880 align:middle line:90%
has paws as opposed to hooves.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you look at it--
and a lot of people go,

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.100 align:middle line:84%
well, these are strange
dietary restrictions.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.870 align:middle line:84%
As you look at it,
some of these animals

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.100 align:middle line:84%
that are considered
unclean are animals

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.220 align:middle line:84%
that would eat dead
flesh-- OK-- or animals

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.430 align:middle line:84%
that would return to their
own waste and consume that.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, those were
considered unclean animals.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It was behavior that the
Hebrew people were not

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.540 align:middle line:90%
to observe within themselves.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.010 align:middle line:84%
They weren't to
touch dead bodies

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.720 align:middle line:84%
or to have anything
to do with waste.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.120 align:middle line:84%
They would dispose
of a properly.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, if an animal
does that by nature,

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.890 align:middle line:90%
they are, by nature, unclean.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
one of the ways

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.210 align:middle line:84%
that we can separate
what's a clean animal?

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:42.720 align:middle line:90%
What's an unclean animal?

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, if Noah is told,
take the clean in this number,

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:50.030 align:middle line:84%
take the unclean in this number,
he has to know the difference.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, my
thoughts are, Mark,

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:57.140 align:middle line:84%
is that somehow Noah
had some foretelling

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.610 align:middle line:90%
knowledge of some catastrophe.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.690 align:middle line:90%
So he built this ark.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And the animals he
put on it were maybe

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.630 align:middle line:84%
his farm animals, whatever
he might have had,

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:90%
pigs, cows, who knows.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Loaded them on the
ark too with them.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.012 align:middle line:84%
And they waited for this
catastrophe to occur.

00:39:17.012 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Well, Noah
would have only dealt

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.530 align:middle line:84%
with the clean animals
as farm animals.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.649 align:middle line:84%
So when the Bible tells us to
also get the unclean animals,

00:39:24.649 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:84%
these are the animals that
he wouldn't have dealt with,

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.480 align:middle line:84%
that he really wouldn't have
had anything to do with.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So whereas I think the
aspect does have some premise

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:35.746 align:middle line:84%
that he's dealing with
domesticated animals,

00:39:35.746 --> 00:39:36.620 align:middle line:90%
the clean.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.570 align:middle line:84%
He's also dealing
with those that

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:40.890 align:middle line:84%
would have been considered--
you mentioned snakes

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.520 align:middle line:84%
or any type of
reptile-- but would

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.220 align:middle line:84%
have been considered things
that you don't domesticate.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the Bible,
is that really the only way

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that we would have
known about Noah?

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you alluded
to some other texts.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.670 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's just the Bible.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: Well,
there's other texts

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.760 align:middle line:84%
that support the story
that actually give us

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.020 align:middle line:90%
more details in other areas.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.550 align:middle line:84%
I introduce three main
texts in the book.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I introduce the
Book of Enoch, which

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.430 align:middle line:90%
most people are familiar with.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:08.227 align:middle line:90%
This is the Book of 1 Enoch.

00:40:08.227 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:90%
There's also a second and third.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.950 align:middle line:84%
But we stayed within
the Book of 1 Enoch.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:16.470 align:middle line:84%
There's also a book that is
called the "Book of Jubilees."

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:18.870 align:middle line:10%
This dates back to
that time period

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:10%
between the last of the prophets
and the first century arrival

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.200 align:middle line:10%
of Christ and the disciples.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are these written
by the same people?

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:10%
>>COMBS: In this
period of time, you

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.136 align:middle line:10%
had a lot of people who
wrote things anonymously.

00:40:31.136 --> 00:40:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're
written by scholars.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:33.680 align:middle line:90%
They're written by scribes.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.210 align:middle line:84%
They're written by
people who are studying.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But they never attach
their name to it.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, they
didn't attach their name

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.890 align:middle line:90%
to it out of respect.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And so, these
collection of books

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.830 align:middle line:84%
are known as Pseudepigrapha,
because we don't know

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.390 align:middle line:90%
who actually composed them.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But they do date to
this time period,

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:52.660 align:middle line:84%
which most scholars refer to
as Second Temple literature.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.820 align:middle line:84%
The same thing follows
with the "Book of Jasher."

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And some scholars
will accept that

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.260 align:middle line:84%
as what we have
today is an accurate

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.480 align:middle line:90%
copy of the "Book of Jasher."

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Some others criticize it.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.912 align:middle line:84%
But the "Book of Jasher" was a
third book that we brought in.

00:41:05.912 --> 00:41:07.620 align:middle line:84%
We try to give a little
bit of background

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:10.170 align:middle line:84%
on each as to why we
were referencing it

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and, then, also bring out
the information that's

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:16.790 align:middle line:84%
within that book that
supports and correlates

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.462 align:middle line:84%
and helps us to see what the
Bible is trying to tell us.

00:41:19.462 --> 00:41:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there are
many sources that--

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>COMBS: There are many sources.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.246 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --cooperate
with the fact

00:41:23.246 --> 00:41:25.000 align:middle line:90%
that the Ark story is authentic?

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COMBS: There are many sources,
including just historians

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:30.840 align:middle line:84%
such as Josephus, who wrote
during the first century;

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Philo, who wrote a few
hundred years before that.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.910 align:middle line:10%
Even some of your
Greeks, such as m

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.600 align:middle line:10%
refer to things along
these same lines.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.870 align:middle line:10%
And we separate
cultures and don't

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.440 align:middle line:10%
realize that a
writer such as Philo,

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.040 align:middle line:10%
who was a Jewish
writer, actually

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:10%
referenced Plato,
who was a Greek.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, maybe
one day we'll find out.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.860 align:middle line:10%
And perhaps, the best
way is if we ever find

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.610 align:middle line:10%
the Ark, wherever it may be.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
