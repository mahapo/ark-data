00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:10%
One of the world's foremost UFO
researchers and investigators

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.640 align:middle line:10%
is Grant Cameron.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:84%
He's won a numerous series
of awards for his work,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:90%
and he's a noted author.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.979 align:middle line:84%
His latest work is
called "Managing Magic,"

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with
the government's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:90%
plan for disclosure.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.174 align:middle line:90%
Grant, welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:39.631 align:middle line:84%
>>GRANT CAMERON:
Thank you, George.

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate your interest,
and I'm honored to be here.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are by far one
of the top investigators

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:90%
in this field.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.217 align:middle line:84%
What got Grant
Cameron into this?

00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: I had a UFO sighting.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.184 align:middle line:90%
I had a town in this book.

00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I tried to publish
it in the '70s.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.474 align:middle line:84%
It's finally going to
be published in August.

00:00:56.474 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That long?

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: But at the time
when I had the sighting,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:10%
it was a small town.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:10%
I live just above
North Dakota in Canada.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:10%
It was a small town
there, and these sightings

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:10%
were taking place.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.625 align:middle line:90%
I had no interest in UFOs.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I had interest in
near-death experiences.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I had done a study at
hospitals with dying cancer

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.227 align:middle line:90%
patients and stuff like that.

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:84%
No interest in UFOs,
but I just wanted

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
to see what everybody
was seeing in the town.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So I said to my friend,
let's go and see this thing.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, OK, because it was
in the newspaper all the time.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was, like,
a regular occurrence?

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.428 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Regular, it was
coming almost every night.

00:01:28.428 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was a small town,
2,000 people, just farming.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:10%
So we didn't go
for three months.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:10%
And then the local TV station
caught this thing jumping off

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:10%
the ground.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:10%
They actually had a film crew
caught it, and I said, come on.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.581 align:middle line:84%
Let's go see what
they're looking at.

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And I always describe it as
I bought the lottery ticket,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:90%
but I knew I was going to win.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:90%
It was like you buy it.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:90%
And I went out there.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And the thing flew
right in front the car.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:90%
It was not a light in the sky.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.539 align:middle line:84%
It was an object
that flew right down

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:90%
low, right in front of the car.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:90%
And it just changed my life.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:90%
I just went, like, wow.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And then two nights later,
I dragged all my friends out

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you've
got to see this.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.821 align:middle line:90%
It will change your life.

00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:00.036 align:middle line:90%
I was all excited.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And I brought all
my friends out.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And an hour later, they said,
we're going back to Winnipeg

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:90%
for pizza.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:90%
We're tired.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:90%
I said, come on.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Stay.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Stay.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes later, it came.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And it came right at
us the second night.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:90%
It was, like, right there.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost like 30
years later, I was thinking,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if it was done on
purpose, just to drag me

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.184 align:middle line:84%
into this thing, because all my
friends, nobody was affected.

00:02:18.184 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
But me, I just fell off
the edge of the Earth.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And so what I had
done was when I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
tried to publish the manuscript,
the local publisher who should

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
have published it, because
it was a famous story, said,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Cameron, you may believe
in this kind of stuff.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Count me among the unbelievers.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.389 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, this
sighting stuff, I

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
had recorded all the people
in the town, hundreds

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:90%
of people that had sightings.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't care.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, all
I'm interested in is

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:90%
what did I see.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Somebody in the world has to
know what I saw, somebody.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.532 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a little guy.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I went
through the chain of command.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I went to the
Canadian government.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Then I went and chased
the former president

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.369 align:middle line:84%
of Penn State University,
who knew what was going on.

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:54.368 align:middle line:84%
And he led to the president
of the United States

00:02:54.368 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:84%
because he had worked
for Eisenhower.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went to
the Presidential Library,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:84%
looking for Dr. Walker's files,
it suddenly occurred to me.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, the president
is the most powerful guy

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:84%
He's got to know
what's going on.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the search
through the Presidential

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.427 align:middle line:84%
Library started,
to find out, what

00:03:09.427 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
does the president know about
the most important subject

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:90%
in the world?

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And some know.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Some don't.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I think
they all know.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I used to believe that.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that they all know
and that they all are briefed.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
trying to cover is

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:84%
they want you to think the
president is a puppet, so you

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:84%
don't ask him,
because if you think

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.509 align:middle line:84%
it's the Wizard of
Oz or an evil cabal,

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:90%
you're never going to ask them.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:10%
But if everybody knows
that Barack Obama--

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:10%
for example, Barack
Obama, in 2015

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:10%
he gives an interview
to GQ Magazine.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:10%
And GQ Magazine, I don't know
whether the guy fell asleep

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:10%
or what happened.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:10%
But he said, well,
did you ever get

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:10%
to look at the secret files,
you know, the book of secrets?

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
know, everybody always

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.339 align:middle line:90%
asks me about UFOs and Roswell.

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, I just want
to let you know,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
that top-secret stuff isn't as
exciting as you think it is.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, this is
the ideal opportunity.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.842 align:middle line:84%
And the next question
was, would you

00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
like to be a Supreme
Court justice?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's, like, unbelievable.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:90%
So this is the whole thing.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like not hitting
the tennis ball back, huh?

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.819 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, or,
you know, George Bush

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
coming out on the Kimmel
show just recently.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.506 align:middle line:84%
And Kimmel now asks
everybody that question.

00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a standard
question for a president.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And Bush said,
well, that's the same question

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.107 align:middle line:90%
that my daughters always ask me.

00:04:20.107 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And then Kimmel says, well,
can you answer the question?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.274 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:23.274 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
tell us anything?

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm not telling you nothing.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.288 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, as
a matter of fact,

00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Bill Clinton was on
Jimmy Kimmel, when you

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.852 align:middle line:90%
talk about standard questions.

00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL CLINTON: When the
Roswell thing came up,

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:84%
I knew we'd get
gazillions of letters.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.117 align:middle line:84%
So I had all the Roswell
papers reviewed, everything.

00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JIMMY KIMMEL: If you saw
that there were aliens there,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:90%
would you tell us?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.832 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.832 --> 00:04:44.985 align:middle line:90%
>>CLINTON: Yeah.

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:45.375 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:46.208 align:middle line:90%
>>KIMMEL: You would?

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:47.225 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:48.025 align:middle line:90%
>>CLINTON: I would.

00:04:48.025 --> 00:04:48.122 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:48.955 align:middle line:90%
>>KIMMEL: You would?

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:49.755 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CLINTON: Well, I think, look.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:90%
What do we know?

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:84%
We know now we live in an
ever-expanding universe.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are
billions of stars and planets,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
literally, out there, and the
universe is getting bigger.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:84%
We know from our
fancy telescopes

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
that just in the last 2
years more than 20 planets

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
have been identified outside
our solar system that

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
seem to be far enough away from
their suns and dense enough

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:84%
that they might be able to
support some form of life.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.357 align:middle line:84%
So it makes it increasingly
less likely that we're alone.

00:05:22.357 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMMEL: Oh, you're
trying to give me

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:90%
a hint that there are aliens?

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CLINTON: No, I'm trying
to tell you I don't know.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:84%
But if we were visited someday,
I wouldn't be surprised.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I just hope that it's
not like "Independence

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.607 align:middle line:84%
Day," the movie, that
it's, you know, a conflict.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMMEL: Well, now we
have friendly aliens.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.815 align:middle line:84%
>>CLINTON: It may
be the only way

00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
to unite this increasingly
divided world of ours.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe him
when he said, I don't know?

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: He's doing
the double take.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
He says, I asked for
all the Roosevelt files,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and I don't believe
a UFO crashed.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, you either have
it one way or the other.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.284 align:middle line:84%
Either you've got all
the Roswell files,

00:05:59.284 --> 00:06:00.700 align:middle line:84%
or you don't know
what's going on.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.440 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know
what's going on,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.023 align:middle line:84%
how did you get all
the Roswell files?

00:06:03.023 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the official story
was the Roswell files

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:90%
were destroyed.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
When the US Air Force looked for
them in 1993, they're all gone.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.800 align:middle line:90%
And yet Bill said he read them.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:90%
And so it's this double take.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:84%
But when you get Hillary
on there, and he asks her,

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.617 align:middle line:84%
he said, OK, l had
your husband on here.

00:06:17.617 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said he
couldn't find anything.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:90%
What about you?

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And she can't even
wait for the applause.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.149 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMMEL: When we had your
husband, President Clinton,

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:28.380 align:middle line:84%
on this show, I asked him
about UFOs and Area 51

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.121 align:middle line:84%
and if he looked into--
because if I was president,

00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:90%
that's the first thing I'd do.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I'd go right into those files
and see what was going on.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he did
do that, and that he

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.165 align:middle line:90%
didn't find anything.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.275 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:46.211 align:middle line:84%
>>HILLARY CLINTON: Well,
I'm going to do it again.

00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:47.975 align:middle line:90%
>>KIMMEL: Yeah, why not?

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CLINTON: And, you
know, there's a new name.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:84%
It's unexplained
aerial phenomenon.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMMEL: Unexplained
aerial phenomenon, really?

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.429 align:middle line:84%
>>CLINTON: Yeah, UAP, that's
the latest nomenclature.

00:06:58.429 --> 00:06:59.636 align:middle line:90%
>>KIMMEL: I like the old one.

00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:90%
I like UFO.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CLINTON: Well, I think we
can use them interchangeably.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:84%
But I would like us
to go into those files

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.709 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully make as much
of that public as possible.

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
If there's nothing
there, let's tell people

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.220 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing there.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMMEL: What if there
is something there?

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.325 align:middle line:84%
>>CLINTON: Well, if
there is something there,

00:07:16.325 --> 00:07:18.830 align:middle line:84%
unless it's a threat
to national security,

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I think we ought to
share it with the public.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Hillary has never
not answered the question.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.904 align:middle line:84%
She has not brought
it up, but she has not

00:07:28.904 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
walked around the question
in the same way Bill did.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And I actually believe that
she was going to do something

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:90%
if she had gotten in.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, she didn't win.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.168 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
a picture of her

00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
with the late
Lawrence Rockefeller,

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:84%
holding a book,
obviously on UFOs.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Hoes And she was
walking with him.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
You know she was talking
to him about that.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, and
she was very open,

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:84%
because that was
through one of my FOIAs.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
What happened was I got the
1,000 pages of documents

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
from the Clinton White House
when they were still in.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And this dealt with the
Rockefeller Initiative,

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.241 align:middle line:84%
where Rockefeller comes
to the White House,

00:07:58.241 --> 00:07:59.692 align:middle line:90%
and he's demanding disclosure.

00:07:59.692 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:90%
And they deal with him.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.275 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
documents were released

00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:90%
when Bill was still in.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So when the Clinton Library
opened five years later,

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.450 align:middle line:84%
FOIA works first
come, first served.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.319 align:middle line:84%
So I had all the
first FOIAs in there.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And all the news media
in the United States

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:84%
was trying to figure out
why 11 of the first 18 FOIAs

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:90%
were on UFOs.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, because I was at
the front of the line.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You were there.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And I had
all the documents.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what you wanted.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I knew all the
people that were involved.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So I was asking for
Rockefeller's files,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Hillary's files, Bill's
files, Podesta's files.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.224 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
requests were going in.

00:08:30.224 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of the
documents that I asked for,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:84%
was all the pictures
from the ranch, when

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Rockefeller went to the ranch.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the picture
with the book came out.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.126 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was you.

00:08:39.126 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And so when
Hillary came out in 2000,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.460 align:middle line:84%
when she was running
for election last time,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.190 align:middle line:84%
she said, do you know that
the most requested item

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:90%
at the Clinton Library is UFOs?

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And I went, she's
actually paying attention.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.164 align:middle line:84%
It's like you figure that
you're wasting your time,

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:54.365 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly she
references my FOIAs.

00:08:54.365 --> 00:08:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And that dragged me back
in, because I'm more

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:90%
interested in consciousness.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:90%
I've sort of given up on--

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.166 align:middle line:84%
I actually gave all the
Rockefeller Initiative

00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:84%
documents away, because I
figure the president knows.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.256 align:middle line:84%
He's really not
going to tell you.

00:09:04.256 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm more interested in
the consciousness thing,

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:90%
where I think the answers are.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet when she
referenced it, I

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.270 align:middle line:84%
said, well, man, I've got
all this Clinton stuff.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:10%
So then I wrote a book
on Hillary and Bill

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.897 align:middle line:10%
and their fascinating
interest in UFOs.

00:09:15.897 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
real, which is real.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Which is real, yeah,
and so Hillary, actually, I

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.867 align:middle line:84%
think if you asked
her, she would actually

00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:25.700 align:middle line:90%
answer the question.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:90%
She was prepared to talk.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually
asked by our producer,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:84%
after the election was over,
when Hillary lost, and said,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:84%
if you had a chance to ask
Bill Clinton a question,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.949 align:middle line:90%
what would you ask him?

00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking to myself,
he's got an interview

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.100 align:middle line:90%
with Bill Clinton.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, the only
question you want to ask--

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and I always tell people, if
you get the president, a vice

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.022 align:middle line:84%
president, a four-star general,
or the unified command,

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:47.438 align:middle line:84%
there's only one
question you ask.

00:09:47.438 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the question
I asked Dick Cheney.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to know
if they've seen a UFO.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to know if
they're interested in UFOs,

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.780 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to
walk around the question.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.400 align:middle line:90%
The only question you ask them--

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and that's the question
I asked Bill Clinton--

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
at any point, did you
ask for a UFO briefing,

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.050 align:middle line:84%
or did you receive
a UFO briefing?

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And if so, when was it,
and what were you told?

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.667 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked Dick Cheney
that question, he said,

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:10.250 align:middle line:84%
if I had been briefed
on that subject,

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:90%
it would probably be classified.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't be
talking about it.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.286 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
exactly what happened.

00:10:15.286 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Exactly, and
so nobody's asked Bill

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:90%
the question.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:84%
But Kimmel is
getting very close.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Kimmel is saying, did you
go and look for the files?

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He doesn't
let it go, either.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.422 align:middle line:84%
Whenever there's a
presidential candidate on,

00:10:28.422 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:90%
he goes right after it.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.120 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, and you see
with the Obama situation,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:10%
if you remember, Ben Hansen
from "Fact Versus Faked"

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:10%
does the analysis.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.080 align:middle line:10%
So when you play
the clip of Bill,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:10%
you know, Bill's doing
all these body motions.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And Ben Hansen saying is saying
it looks deceptive, like he's

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:90%
being deceptive on camera.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a look at the
Obama clip, Obama comes out.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.875 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you
realize now they're

00:10:52.875 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:84%
going to be watching everything
you do, when you swallow,

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.050 align:middle line:90%
everything you do.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's referring to the
fact that Hansen is going

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:90%
to go over the video and check.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.572 align:middle line:84%
And so when he gets asked
the question, he said, OK.

00:11:03.572 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Bill said he couldn't
get anything.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
When you went there,
what did you find?

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:90%
They're watching on high-def TV.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.420 align:middle line:84%
He's got a lapel
pin, a US lapel pin.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Ben Hansen, when

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
he gets asked that question,
he's breathing at 42 times

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:90%
a minute.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.895 align:middle line:90%
He's hyperventilating.

00:11:16.895 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow, wow.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And
this is a guy who's

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:84%
six years as
president, who's used

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:90%
to answering tough questions.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And when he gets asked that
question, he's petrified.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.457 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I can't
reveal anything,

00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:27.540 align:middle line:90%
which is the right answer.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:27.655 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.655 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, he was
telling the truth.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, he's
telling the truth.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.999 align:middle line:90%
So you see this kind of thing.

00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think Kimmel
is almost the guy who

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.385 align:middle line:90%
may break this thing loose.

00:11:35.385 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If we don't.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.662 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, if we don't.

00:11:37.662 --> 00:11:38.870 align:middle line:90%
He keeps asking the question.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:90%
He gets them on there.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
a matter of time.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.877 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
most of them, they're

00:11:44.877 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:90%
really not lying about it.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.251 align:middle line:90%
They're just walking around it.

00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Bill Clinton will do that
sort of dance that you showed.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he gets
his laughs out of it.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Barack
Obama will make a joke.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Hillary is very direct, but
she's really not been asked.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And in Hillary's case,
she's never brought it up.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.110 align:middle line:84%
There's some sort of
arrangement where she only

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:90%
answers questions.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you remember,
the Wikileaks

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
documents reference
the fact that she

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:84%
was going to appear on Kimmel's
show in November of 2015.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And she had actually
rehearsed the question

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.980 align:middle line:84%
because Podesta had said,
ask Hillary about the aliens.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the question
didn't get asked.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.104 align:middle line:84%
And she was upset
because she had

00:12:19.104 --> 00:12:21.925 align:middle line:84%
practiced for five minutes the
answer to the UFO question.

00:12:21.925 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not somebody who
doesn't know what's going on.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And what she said
in her interview,

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:84%
when she answered
Kimmel, she said,

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:84%
if I can get agreement, which
means that as the president

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be whoever
it is, some sort of council

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:90%
or the national security people.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.779 align:middle line:84%
If I can get agreement,
I will release,

00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
which indicates that she will
have the files in front of her.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's some sort
of meeting takes place.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And now it's gone.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: And now it's gone.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The first craft you
saw, it came very close to you.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe
what it looked like?

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.392 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: It looked
like it was alive.

00:12:57.392 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:90%
It was pulsing.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
It was coming from
the left to the right.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.849 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was
we were looking around.

00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:04.890 align:middle line:84%
We were looking at what
everybody was looking at.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've seen
stars and planets.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're going, well, if
that's what they're looking at,

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:90%
it's not very impressive.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.082 align:middle line:84%
But when it came,
nobody said, is

00:13:12.082 --> 00:13:13.290 align:middle line:90%
that what they're looking at?

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Everybody just
went, there it is.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:90%
And it was alive.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:90%
It was pulsing.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It was, like, a
plasma-type object.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was pulsing.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it look solid?

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.206 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well,
it looked like it

00:13:22.206 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
was an object that had huge
light coming out of it.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.064 align:middle line:84%
But it was an object,
but you couldn't

00:13:27.064 --> 00:13:28.230 align:middle line:90%
see the shape of the object.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:90%
It was longer than it was high.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was too
much light around it?

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: There
was too much light.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:90%
It was really, really intense.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:90%
And it was moving up and down.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.354 align:middle line:90%
What we called bobbing.

00:13:34.354 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of
moving up and down.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So it was coming across
the front of the car,

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:38.853 align:middle line:90%
right in front of the car.

00:13:38.853 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big would it be?

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Big as a small plane.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 30 feet?

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Hard to tell,
it was fairly close.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:90%
So at night, it's hard to tell.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Any sound?

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: No sound,
nothing, and it was so low.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.906 align:middle line:84%
There was a set of school
buses outside this town.

00:13:51.906 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And I remember,
I was getting out

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:84%
of the car-- the car
was still moving--

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to
get through the ditch

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:90%
and across this parking lot.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Because it was so low,
it was going to go in

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:90%
behind these school buses.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I just watched it, and
it just sort of pulsed away.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.521 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it illuminate
everything it came close to?

00:14:04.521 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: No, in fact,
a year later, I had one.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.752 align:middle line:84%
It was a smaller object,
where I was 50 feet away.

00:14:10.752 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the one
when I famously was

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:90%
going to jump on this thing.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It was like, you know,
the doubting Thomas.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.609 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to touch.

00:14:16.609 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I realized that you
could get burned.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.066 align:middle line:84%
Something could happen,
but I had to touch it.

00:14:20.066 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:90%
And I remember, it was this far.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
It was sitting on a wooden
bridge, a drainage bridge where

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
they were draining
water off the fields.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it
was sitting this far

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.090 align:middle line:90%
from the edge of the bridge.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was so bright,
you couldn't look at it

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:90%
with binoculars.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.760 align:middle line:90%
We had binoculars.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It hurt your eyes.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: It would hurt
your eyes, it was so bright.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.805 align:middle line:84%
And yet it was this far away
from the edge of the bridge.

00:14:37.805 --> 00:14:39.941 align:middle line:84%
And it just was casting
this orange glow.

00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:90%
It was an orange object.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:84%
It was orange glow
on the bridge.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And to this day,
it still haunts me.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like, why was it not
lighting up the bridge?

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It should have
lit up everything.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It should've.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.478 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: So we called
them dead lights.

00:14:51.478 --> 00:14:53.440 align:middle line:84%
It was like a very
intense light,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:90%
but not casting any light.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
an LED light does.

00:14:56.315 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, yeah, and so
to me, it sort of dragged me in.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And it got me into
this situation

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:84%
where I started this
chain of command

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.720 align:middle line:84%
up through trying to find
out-- and then I chased,

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:84%
you know, the head scientist for
the CIA, what the CIA is doing.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And I came to conclusion
with my latest book

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
that the government is
actually leaking material.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On purpose.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.516 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: On
purpose, and they've

00:15:18.516 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:90%
been doing it for 70 years.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
But what they're doing
is they're leaking

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:90%
what's called the core story.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:90%
They've been here.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.605 align:middle line:90%
There's been a craft, a crash.

00:15:27.605 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:84%
We've done some
back engineering.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:90%
We're not doing so well.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:84%
This core story, but
they're protecting

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:90%
the classified information.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do in
"Managing Magic," the book,

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:84%
is I go through 70
years because what

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:84%
happened was if you remember
the Wikileaks emails,

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:84%
one of the big disclosures there
was Tom DeLonge the famous rock

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:90%
star.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.310 align:middle line:84%
All his emails
ended up in there.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:84%
He had the two generals and the
head of Lockheed Skunk Words,

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and he's dealing
with John Podesta.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:90%
And I saw this.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
they're doing it again,

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.220 align:middle line:84%
because I've been in
this for a long time.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:84%
So I was around when Bill
Moore, in the 1980s, when he

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:90%
wrote the first Roswell book.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So I knew they've had
been doing this all along.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had dealt
with Bob Emenegger,

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:84%
who had done this
film in the 1970s

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.199 align:middle line:90%
for the Nixon administration.

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they
being used these people,

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.991 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't know it?

00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:15.573 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well,
some of them knew it.

00:16:15.573 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Some of them didn't know it.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like they
were offered material.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Like Disney, for
example, Disney did

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of documentaries
for the US government

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%
during World War II, for the
military and stuff like that.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was asked
to do a documentary

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:90%
for the government in 1956.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.002 align:middle line:84%
And it was the same thing as
Bob Emenegger's in the 1970s,

00:16:36.002 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:84%
where they offered him a bunch
of film and stuff like that.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.834 align:middle line:84%
He puts the
documentary together,

00:16:39.834 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and then they pull the
film at the very end.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And Bob Emenegger is the most
prime example of the fact.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I say there's three
different options.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.339 align:middle line:90%
The government is disclosing.

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:50.379 align:middle line:84%
And they're not disclosing
because if they wanted

00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
to disclose they would get The
New York Times, The Washington

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.525 align:middle line:90%
Post, CNN, Fox.

00:16:54.525 --> 00:16:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And pelt them,
pelt them with stuff.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And they would take
them and show them the crafts,

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.550 align:middle line:84%
the bodies, give them a
letter from the president,

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:90%
have a news conference.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.185 align:middle line:90%
So they're not disclosing.

00:17:01.185 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Go on my
radio show, all that.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.269 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, exactly,
and they're not covering up,

00:17:06.269 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:84%
because if they were
covering up, they would do--

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:90%
I live in Canada.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.251 align:middle line:84%
And because I do the
presidents, everybody always

00:17:11.251 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:84%
says to me, well, what's
going on in Canada?

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:10%
Last year, Paul
Hellyer told a story

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:10%
about the head of emergency
management in Canada.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Former Canadian
defense minister.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:21.317 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Defense
minister, and he

00:17:21.317 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
tells this story about his
dying guy who was the emergency

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:84%
management guy in Canada,
who on his deathbed

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:84%
tells Hellyer,
yes, I was briefed.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:90%
I was taken to Area 51.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I went inside a craft,
all this kind of stuff.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Other than that,
people would ask me

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in Canada,
I'd say, I have no idea.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea, because
if you want to cover up,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:90%
you just shut up.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.336 align:middle line:90%
Stop talking about it.

00:17:41.336 --> 00:17:42.460 align:middle line:90%
And you don't say anything.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
in Australia and Canada

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:90%
and Belgium.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows
what's going on.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:84%
In the United States of America,
everybody is leaking documents.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:84%
There's people leaking stuff,
so they're not covering up.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.830 align:middle line:84%
If they wanted to cover up,
they would just shut up.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.996 align:middle line:90%
And the story would go away.

00:17:53.996 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And the prime example of that is
in the 1970s, is Bob Emenegger.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So they shut down
Blue Book in 1969.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And they never have to
ever talk about UFOs again.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to put any
press people to answer every UFO

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.459 align:middle line:90%
sighting that comes up.

00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
They can just shut
up and do nothing.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.833 align:middle line:90%
So what did they do?

00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:84%
In 1973, Bob Emenegger,
who worked for the Nixon

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.722 align:middle line:84%
administration for
campaign, he was

00:18:18.722 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:90%
working on their advertising.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was part
of their media guy.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.485 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, and he was
working with Grey Advertising

00:18:23.485 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angeles.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.065 align:middle line:84%
And he was friends
with Bob Haldeman.

00:18:26.065 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:84%
He'd gone to school with Bob
Haldeman, the chief of staff

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.350 align:middle line:90%
for Nixon.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:90%
And he comes up.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.737 align:middle line:90%
And he doesn't believe in UFOs.

00:18:31.737 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And he gets called to
Norton Air Force Base.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:90%
And this to me is the example.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.280 align:middle line:84%
If you want to say that
they're covering up,

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:90%
you've got to explain this one.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:90%
He gets called there.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well,
Watergate days.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
We've got problems
with the military.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And we need you to do some
documentaries to make the US

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:90%
military look better.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:90%
So they had eight documentaries.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
They do 3D holography, working
with dolphins, all these kind

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.200 align:middle line:90%
of things, so fine.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds like the
department of propaganda,

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah,
exactly, and he was going

00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:90%
to do these films for them.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.865 align:middle line:84%
And then they
said, and we'd also

00:19:00.865 --> 00:19:02.957 align:middle line:84%
like you to do a
documentary on UFOs.

00:19:02.957 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And we'd like you to hide
it under the other eight

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:90%
documentaries.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:90%
And Bob went, what?

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:90%
You mean this is for real?

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, he
used to bug his wife.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:84%
He'd say, Margaret, quit
reading that garbage.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, the alien had my
baby stuff, that's garbage.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And he's suddenly,
this is for real?

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And then he told Paul Shartle,
who was the security manager.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.320 align:middle line:90%
He said, this is for real?

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And Paul says,
what would you say

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:84%
if I told you that we had
a landing of an alien craft

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.872 align:middle line:84%
at Holloman Air Force
Base in May of 1971?

00:19:30.872 --> 00:19:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And we filmed it from three
different vantage points.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, my,
and they have it.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.096 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: And they have it.

00:19:35.096 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And Linda Howe was offered
it, and Bob Emenegger

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:90%
was offered it.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.874 align:middle line:84%
And so he had this
documentary where he

00:19:39.874 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:90%
was able to go into anywhere.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:84%
He said he could go into the
Pentagon, he and Allan Sandler,

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:90%
who was his partner.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.291 align:middle line:84%
They could walk into the
Pentagon without signing in.

00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:49.040 align:middle line:84%
They were dealing with
all the top people.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.079 align:middle line:84%
They were dealing with Art
Lundahl, who was the top CIA

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:53.370 align:middle line:90%
guy that was dealing with UFOs.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:90%
They did all this stuff.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.910 align:middle line:90%
They put out the documentary.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the funding was coming
from the MacArthur Foundation.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh,
Mr. MacArthur's

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:84%
having problems with people
bugging him about putting up

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.310 align:middle line:90%
the money for the film.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Could you please pull his
name from the credits?

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:90%
But you can keep the money.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And so they put this
documentary out.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.110 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:90%
So in '69, they shut it down.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.724 align:middle line:84%
In 1973, they're pouring
gas back on it again

00:20:20.724 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and starting it all up again
and allowing these guys

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
to do a documentary that
basically says, yeah.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.926 align:middle line:84%
This is for real, and
we landed an alien

00:20:26.926 --> 00:20:28.050 align:middle line:90%
at Holloman Air Force Base.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But they pulled the
film at the very end.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.074 align:middle line:84%
And in the
documentary, which was

00:20:31.074 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
called "UFOs, Past, Present,
and Future," in 1975

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:90%
it was released.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:38.130 align:middle line:90%
It was rereleased in 1979.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.410 align:middle line:84%
In that film, there's
eight seconds of the film

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.390 align:middle line:90%
that they pulled.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The best
part, too, probably.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.755 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, no, the
worst part, just as the object

00:20:46.755 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
is coming over the
hill into Holloman.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a light
coming over the hill.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So I said, Bob, you told
me they pulled the film.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:53.940 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah, they did.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.939 align:middle line:10%
And he told me this story
about some guy driving

00:20:55.939 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:10%
across the country in a Datsun
with this film in the backseat.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:10%
And I said, but there's
eight seconds in the film.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:90%
You told me to pull the film.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but that
was just background.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you
mean it was background?

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.790 align:middle line:84%
He said, it didn't
show anything.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So they allowed him
to use the object

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:12.730 align:middle line:90%
as it comes over the hill.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:84%
When it lands, and you can see
the actual alien coming out

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:84%
of the craft, and the
craft, that's classified.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't see that.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: You don't see that.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So they give him
that eight seconds,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and they allow him to use
it in the documentary.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And then in the 1980s,
they're not finished yet.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
In the 1980s, they want
Jacques Vallee involved,

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:90%
and they want J. Allen Hynek.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's a guy by the
name of General Glen E.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.192 align:middle line:84%
Miller, who is now at
Norton with Paul Shartle.

00:21:35.192 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And they bring them in,
and now they're saying,

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:84%
we want you to do
another documentary.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.131 align:middle line:84%
The government liked
your documentary

00:21:40.131 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:90%
you did in the 1970s.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:90%
We'd like you to do another one.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.310 align:middle line:90%
And now he's suspicious.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:90%
He says--

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why, right?

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Is this Reagan?

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Is this Reagan behind this?

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.027 align:middle line:90%
And no nobody gave the answer.

00:21:51.027 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:90%
And MIller says, Hynek is there.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And he says to Paul
Shartle, I want

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
you to pull all the UFO
film and show it to Hynek.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, General,
I would need a request

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.980 align:middle line:90%
for that, a written request.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, God damn,
I'll have your ass.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:90%
You pull the film for Hynek.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, General, I can't
do it without a request.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a guy who was
Ronald Reagan's first agent

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.200 align:middle line:90%
at Hollywood, Glen E. Miller.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And three months after,
they dismissed these guys.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But you see all these
background things,

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.240 align:middle line:84%
for example, "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind."

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.781 align:middle line:10%
Bob does the first
documentary, where

00:22:23.781 --> 00:22:26.416 align:middle line:10%
they're going to land the craft
at Holloman Air Force Base.

00:22:26.416 --> 00:22:27.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That was
all information

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:10%
that went to Spielberg.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, Spielberg,
he said to me, you know,

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.268 align:middle line:84%
if you take a look at "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,"

00:22:34.268 --> 00:22:36.394 align:middle line:84%
Bob, and you look at
Holloman, it's the same story.

00:22:36.394 --> 00:22:37.684 align:middle line:90%
It's just a different location.

00:22:37.684 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh, I didn't tell you?

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, didn't tell me what?

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.901 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell you I gave
a copy to Spielberg?

00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, you
didn't tell me that.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whoa, and that's
how he built his movie.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.368 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And he
said, I told you,

00:22:47.368 --> 00:22:51.314 align:middle line:84%
Anne Spielberg worked as
a line producer for us.

00:22:51.314 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On the documentary.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: We did a
bunch of documentaries,

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.314 align:middle line:84%
and Anne Spielberg
was working with us.

00:22:55.314 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Steven, would you
like a copy of the documentary?

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.460 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you know what?

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:84%
After "Close
Encounters" came out,

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.107 align:middle line:84%
Steven Spielberg's mother
came up to me and said, Bob,

00:23:06.107 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I've seen your version
of the landing.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen Steven's
version of the landing.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.155 align:middle line:84%
And I like Steven's
version better.

00:23:11.155 --> 00:23:11.650 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.025 align:middle line:84%
So you see these things where
they're dropping the stuff,

00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:90%
even back when it first starts.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Kenneth Arnold,
his daughter is now

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
going to be part of
this "701" documentary

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.050 align:middle line:84%
that James Fox is
trying to put out.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.440 align:middle line:84%
He does an interview with her,
and she shows these photographs

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:84%
that her father was given
by the Fourth Air Force.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of things
he saw, right?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, no, of
objects that they had filmed,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like
gun camera footage.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they were similar
to what Arnold had seen.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.089 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, and
said, this is for real.

00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:90%
We want you to tell them.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you're covering
it up, why are you

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:44.649 align:middle line:84%
giving Kenneth
Arnold photographs

00:23:44.649 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and trying to assure him
that this stuff is real?

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I
go through the book.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
it year by year,

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:84%
year after year after year, and
you go like, wow, and even now,

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:56.176 align:middle line:84%
I say there's at least
six initiatives going

00:23:56.176 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:84%
on at the very present
moment, where they're trying

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:90%
to drop this thing indirectly.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.309 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
they're disclosing.

00:24:02.309 --> 00:24:03.850 align:middle line:84%
They're doing the
gradual disclosure,

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.810 align:middle line:84%
the acclimatization, or as
Bob Bigelow describes it,

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:84%
a confirmation that
this thing's for real.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Why are they doing that?

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well,
they're doing it

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.376 align:middle line:84%
because the aliens
are doing it as well.

00:24:13.376 --> 00:24:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Whoever the force is behind,
they're dropping hints.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:90%
They're revealing themselves.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.800 align:middle line:90%
They're talking to experiencers.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.470 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, these
4,000 experiencers.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the government
can't control that.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: They
can't control that.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So they have to
realize that they're

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:84%
behind the eight
ball on this thing,

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.710 align:middle line:90%
that this thing is unraveling.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want
people back in 1947.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:90%
You want them out there.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, the latest
story that when I heard it

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.860 align:middle line:84%
two months ago I went, come on,
already, it's the portal story.

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:90%
And I go, portal?

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:90%
A portal?

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is the story
they're trying to put out.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So the story is being
put out by Ron Pandolfi.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And Ron Pandolfi,
The New York Times

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:51.040 align:middle line:84%
described him as the head
scientist of the CIA in 1996.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I know for a fact that in
the Rockefeller Initiative

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:58.071 align:middle line:84%
documents, when Rockefeller
came to the White House--

00:24:58.071 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To get these answers.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --to
get the answers, he

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:84%
was dealing with the
president's science adviser, who

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:90%
was Dr. Jack Gibbons.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.445 align:middle line:84%
Now Jack Gibbons, as soon as
he heard Rockefeller was coming

00:25:06.445 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to
talk about UFOs,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:84%
requested a UFO
briefing from the CIA.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was given to Dr.
Ronald Pandolfi to do.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Now Pandolfi didn't do it.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
He gave it to Bruce
Maccabee because we're CIA.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:84%
We can't do an
official, open briefing.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Bruce
has gone public.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And so
Bruce puts it out.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.688 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't mean anything.

00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:26.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a private citizen
telling his version of UFOs.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.310 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean anything.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So Pandolfi would go in the back
door and do the real briefing.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
part of the record,

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:84%
that he was given
that job in 1993.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:90%
He's been doing this since 1983.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:84%
So he's one of the
people that appears

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.380 align:middle line:84%
to be behind one of
these initiatives.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is the
thing with the portal.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually putting
this stuff on open internet

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:49.749 align:middle line:84%
His wife's name is
Aliyah Pandolfi.

00:25:49.749 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that on YouTube
and things like that?

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: It's on YouTube.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:10%
She has her own YouTube
channel, and she's

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:10%
putting these things on.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, Ron
Pandolfi is on camera.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And he says, the president
will deal with this,

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:84%
or the world will
return to a singularity.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't know
what job he has.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I hear that they go
to Langley everyday.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.450 align:middle line:84%
We knew he was at one
point with the director

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:84%
of national intelligence, above
the CIA, in the White House.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.987 align:middle line:84%
So he's very high level,
whatever his classified job is.

00:26:17.987 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And when he comes on camera
and says the president

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:84%
will deal with this, and then
on a second YouTube video

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.680 align:middle line:90%
that was released by his wife--

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and this is scattered in
a bunch of other talks

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:90%
that they're having--

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.207 align:middle line:90%
he talks about the portal.

00:26:30.207 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't believe it.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:84%
He's on camera, talking
about this porta.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.291 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't use the word portal.

00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:37.215 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything that you
hear, that corroborates it.

00:26:37.215 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: You and I
both know Chris Bledsoe.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Chris Bledsoe is part of
an initiative as well.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Chris Bledsoe, and I've
had a number of encounters,

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.780 align:middle line:84%
very dramatic
encounters with Chris,

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:90%
so I've known Chris for a while.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that he had a CIA guy
that was connected to the White

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.020 align:middle line:90%
House.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:52.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Feeding him?

00:26:52.895 --> 00:26:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: That
was directing him,

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:84%
he calls him his mentor,
that's sort of directing him.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And he's the guy that's running
Tom DeLonge's operation.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:90%
His name is Jim Semivan.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And he's a briefer for
the president as well.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So you have Semivan,
and you have

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Pandolfi, who are both
briefers for the president.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.210 align:middle line:90%
They're not butlers.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're the top guys.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So Semivan, I had
heard about Semivan

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:84%
even before he went
to Tom DeLonge.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Now he's openly come
out with Tom DeLonge

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.835 align:middle line:84%
and said that April
of 2016, he heard

00:27:21.835 --> 00:27:23.460 align:middle line:84%
what Tom DeLonge was
doing, that he had

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:90%
these contacts in the military.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.580 align:middle line:90%
And he's directing this.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, I
asked Chris Bledsoe.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I said, what's the
thing with the portal?

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And he contacted Semivan, and
he said Semivan confirmed it.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:90%
There's a portal.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, unbelievable.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.777 align:middle line:90%
So they want this portal thing.

00:27:36.777 --> 00:27:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And this ties into this
consciousness thing,

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:84%
which is so important to me,
is that most people think

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that the UFO thing
is going to be

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:45.630 align:middle line:84%
the president is going to
stand up and say, ETs are here.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:90%
But it may not be ETs.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
gonna happen like that.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: It may be what
they call ultra-terrestrials.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And the portal idea is
the consciousness thing,

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that when you go
through the portal,

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.610 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like going into a
lucid dream world, where you

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:58.860 align:middle line:84%
can actually manifest on the
other side of the portal,

00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.984 align:middle line:90%
that it's interdimensional.

00:27:59.984 --> 00:28:01.029 align:middle line:90%
It's consciousness.

00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's what Semivan--

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
if you read Semivan, he does a
forward to Tom DeLonge's book.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.422 align:middle line:84%
Now the importance of
Semivan is that people

00:28:08.422 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:84%
think there are just evil
people in government.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.796 align:middle line:84%
I know a number
of the people that

00:28:11.796 --> 00:28:14.790 align:middle line:84%
are connected with Chris
Bledsoe and a number

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.960 align:middle line:90%
of these high-level people.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.126 align:middle line:90%
And they're not evil people.

00:28:17.126 --> 00:28:19.445 align:middle line:84%
They're just people who are
very interested themselves.

00:28:19.445 --> 00:28:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
these answers.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.085 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.085 --> 00:28:22.626 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Semivan
is an experiencer.

00:28:22.626 --> 00:28:25.600 align:middle line:84%
He had an experience in the
1990s with him and his wife.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a guy that
briefs the president.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.160 align:middle line:84%
He has this experience
with his wife.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So when he writes in
Tom DeLonge's forward

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:84%
to his paperback book
for "Chasing Shadows,"

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
he actually talks a little
bit about his experience.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it changed
my view of reality.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, basically, the idea
that we can measure, you know,

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:84%
like the physical thing,
he said, is laughable.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, how do you
quantify something

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.350 align:middle line:84%
where there is no
there there, that this

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:84%
may be some other consciousness,
some other dimension?

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.006 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
portal idea comes in,

00:29:01.006 --> 00:29:02.880 align:middle line:84%
is that they're trying
to get across the idea

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.430 align:middle line:84%
that this may not be
a physical phenomenon.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.700 align:middle line:84%
The president can't say it's
ET, because it's more than ET,

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:84%
which when you start
talking to experiencers,

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.870 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize
that this may be true.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.655 align:middle line:84%
For example, I'm very
interested in experiencers

00:29:15.655 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:84%
because I believe
that you're not

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.450 align:middle line:84%
going to learn much by
looking at lights in the sky.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:84%
But you will learn a
lot by talking to people

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.540 align:middle line:90%
who have been on the ship.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar Mitchell's foundation
has 4,000 of these people.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And they're all talking.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.590 align:middle line:90%
And you have these patterns.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:84%
When they answer the questions,
you have these patterns.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things that they
have is something that I ran up

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.680 align:middle line:10%
after I got dragged
into consciousness

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.900 align:middle line:10%
through an experience in 2012.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I had a woman in
2013 that told me

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.020 align:middle line:90%
that she was flying the ship.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.672 align:middle line:84%
And I went, you're flying
the-- and I thought she was--

00:29:46.672 --> 00:29:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you believe her?

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I thought
she was nuts.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had heard a lot
of weird stories about that.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking to
myself, you're nuts.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her, well,
how do you fly a ship?

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, you
do it with your mind.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
checking these people.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.210 align:middle line:90%
And I have three dozen people.

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They corroborate that?

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: They all
say the same thing.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Nobody says anything different.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
mentioned President Obama,

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:90%
when he was on Kimmel's show.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.024 align:middle line:84%
I want everybody to take
a look at what he said.

00:30:10.024 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMMEL: If I was
the president--

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's unlikely that
is ever going to happen.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BARACK OBAMA: You never know.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.908 align:middle line:84%
It was unlikely that I
was going to be president.

00:30:18.908 --> 00:30:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMMEL: The moment
I was inaugurated,

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:26.280 align:middle line:84%
my hand would still be hot
from touching the Bible.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And I would immediately race
to wherever they have the files

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.740 align:middle line:90%
about Area 51 and UFOs.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go through everything
to find out what happened.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.310 align:middle line:90%
Did you do that?

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:43.539 align:middle line:84%
>>OBAMA: That's why you
will not be president,

00:30:43.539 --> 00:30:49.574 align:middle line:84%
because that's the first
thing that you would do.

00:30:49.574 --> 00:30:51.115 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMMEL: It's at
the top of my list.

00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>OBAMA: The aliens
won't let it happen.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.870 align:middle line:90%
You'd reveal all their secrets.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.665 align:middle line:84%
They exercise strict
control over us.

00:30:58.665 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KIMMEL: Now you
know, there are

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.748 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people that
are going to examine

00:31:01.748 --> 00:31:06.610 align:middle line:84%
your facial expressions here,
every twitch, everything.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.110 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, so did you look?

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Did you see?

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Did you explore?

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>OBAMA: I-- I-- I
can't reveal anything.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KIMMEL: Oh, really?

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Because President Clinton
said he did go right in,

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.924 align:middle line:90%
and he did check.

00:31:17.924 --> 00:31:18.840 align:middle line:90%
And there was nothing.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OBAMA: Well, you know, that's
what we're instructed to say.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, there's a lot
of truth to what he just said.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Exactly,
yeah, he's just

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:90%
using jokes to walk around.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.810 align:middle line:84%
He was actually telling
the truth the whole way.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.104 align:middle line:90%
And that's the idea.

00:31:32.104 --> 00:31:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you
don't want to, in history

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.020 align:middle line:84%
when this thing gets
revealed, be recorded

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:90%
as having lied about it.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when he said
the things like the aliens

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:44.164 align:middle line:84%
don't want us to know or say
anything, he kind of chuckled.

00:31:44.164 --> 00:31:46.080 align:middle line:84%
But there could be a lot
of truth behind that.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: I agree.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.250 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the stories
that I've heard recently

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.396 align:middle line:84%
is, if you remember
back in the days when--

00:31:53.396 --> 00:31:56.550 align:middle line:84%
a critical story
I tell in the book

00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:00.810 align:middle line:84%
is about when they were
going to brief Bush,

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.880 align:middle line:90%
when the Soviet Union fell.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Gorbachev dissolves
the Soviet Union.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:90%
The opposition takes over.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.066 align:middle line:84%
Three days later, his
people take over again,

00:32:09.066 --> 00:32:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and they have this
sort of thing.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.190 align:middle line:84%
At that present time, there
was this convoy leaving the UN.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Secretary
General Perez de Cuellar,

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:20.580 align:middle line:84%
according to Hopkins,
was abducted.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.674 align:middle line:84%
And the story I
have been hearing

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:25.090 align:middle line:84%
is that the president has been
abducted a couple of times.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hopkins wrote a
book about that, didn't he?

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, and
so this is the idea,

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.912 align:middle line:84%
that if they grabbed
Perez de Cuellar,

00:32:31.912 --> 00:32:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and if these stories that
I'm hearing are true,

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:35.786 align:middle line:84%
that the president has
actually been abducted,

00:32:35.786 --> 00:32:37.490 align:middle line:84%
just to show who's
running the show,

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:40.740 align:middle line:84%
this is the kind of stuff
where it's almost like--

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I think Semivan was
asked, who's in charge?

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.210 align:middle line:90%
And he said, they are.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You talk a lot
about consciousness.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.681 align:middle line:90%
How come, with UFOs?

00:32:52.681 --> 00:32:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, again, it was,
like, my initial experience.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.950 align:middle line:90%
I just got dragged into it.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:90%
I was the nuts and bolts guy.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I was the government
document stuff,

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.470 align:middle line:90%
and I was going down that road.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching a lecture,
Colin Andrews, in 2012,

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:06.802 align:middle line:90%
in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:33:06.802 --> 00:33:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking
on crop circles.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, he's
one of the best.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I had no
interest in crop circles.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And you know what it's like.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.250 align:middle line:84%
You've been to UFO
Congress a number of times.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:90%
You don't go to everything.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.360 align:middle line:84%
It goes from 8
o'clock in the morning

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.920 align:middle line:84%
till 11 o'clock at night,
so you pick and choose.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.630 align:middle line:84%
You go for dinner
with people and stuff.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm not going
to go to the lecture I'm not

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:22.670 align:middle line:90%
interested.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But then I'm thinking,
well, he's a major figure.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:25.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Rolling
Stones are in town.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's go and watch, you know?

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.910 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK, I'll go watch.

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.609 align:middle line:84%
But I really wasn't
paying attention.

00:33:29.609 --> 00:33:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened with
this consciousness thing.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.140 align:middle line:84%
My idea is that you tuned
into the right station.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And I had tuned out
of his, and I had

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.170 align:middle line:90%
tuned into the right station.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I
got this download.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.560 align:middle line:90%
And it came instantaneously.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.757 align:middle line:84%
And the way I describe it, it
came with absolute certainty.

00:33:44.757 --> 00:33:46.090 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to question this.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:46.900 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to look.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.540 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a savant who is
able to do mathematical stuff.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You just know.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: You just know.

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it came.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And what came was three items.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.352 align:middle line:84%
And they're items I had
put together in my history.

00:33:57.352 --> 00:33:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I just had never
put them together.

00:33:58.810 --> 00:33:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I took the three items.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.708 align:middle line:84%
I said, here they are, and
this how they go together.

00:34:01.708 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:84%
One was in 1950, the
Canadian government

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:84%
had gone to the
Americans and then

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:84%
asked the Americans
in 1950, what's

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:10.112 align:middle line:90%
going on with flying saucers?

00:34:10.112 --> 00:34:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were told, it's the
most highly classified subject

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Flying saucers exist.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.582 align:middle line:84%
It's of tremendous
significance to the Americans.

00:34:18.582 --> 00:34:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And they've got a small group,
headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.600 align:middle line:90%
And I used to lecture on this.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.844 align:middle line:84%
What came into my
mind in that second

00:34:24.844 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:84%
was the very next
line in the document.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:29.698 align:middle line:84%
And it said, we were also
told by American officials

00:34:29.698 --> 00:34:31.239 align:middle line:84%
that other things
might be associated

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.787 align:middle line:84%
with the flying saucers,
such as mental phenomena.

00:34:33.787 --> 00:34:36.370 align:middle line:10%
And the Americans aren't doing
very well because they've said,

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.994 align:middle line:10%
if we're working on it, they're
willing to exchange credentials

00:34:38.994 --> 00:34:39.980 align:middle line:10%
and talk to us.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
The key to that
is in 1950, there

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.870 align:middle line:90%
was nobody talking to aliens.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Betty and Barney
Hill's book would not

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:48.400 align:middle line:90%
be released till the 1960s.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Look Magazine came
out right around that period

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.800 align:middle line:90%
with that story.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.466 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Adamski
wouldn't come forward

00:34:53.466 --> 00:34:55.630 align:middle line:84%
till about seven or eight
days after the detonation

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.560 align:middle line:90%
of the hydrogen bomb.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So there was nobody saying,
we're talking to aliens,

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.988 align:middle line:90%
and they're telepathic.

00:34:58.988 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So how did the Americans
know that mental phenomena

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.800 align:middle line:90%
was involved?

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.174 align:middle line:84%
Now I believe it
was because they

00:35:04.174 --> 00:35:05.454 align:middle line:90%
had a live alien at Roswell.

00:35:05.454 --> 00:35:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And the alien was
talking in their head.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.410 align:middle line:90%
And they realized, like, wow.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:09.701 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How is this happening?

00:35:09.701 --> 00:35:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah, this
is important stuff.

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:13.534 align:middle line:10%
So that was the one thing
that popped into my head.

00:35:13.534 --> 00:35:15.080 align:middle line:84%
The second one
was, as I said, we

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.340 align:middle line:84%
chased Dr. Eric Walker at
Penn State University, who

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:84%
had worked for
Eisenhower, had 14

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:84%
honorary doctorate
degrees, chairman

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.870 align:middle line:84%
of the board of the Institute
for the Advanced Sciences.

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.453 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't deny
anything, did he?

00:35:24.453 --> 00:35:24.607 align:middle line:90%


00:35:24.607 --> 00:35:26.065 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: He would
walk around it.

00:35:26.065 --> 00:35:27.610 align:middle line:84%
He would talk in
rhymes and riddles.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So at one point, he was being
asked about the MJ-12 group.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:90%
What's with MJ-12?

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.920 align:middle line:10%
Is it still all Americans?

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.150 align:middle line:10%
Or is it all just 12 people?

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:35.524 align:middle line:10%
Or are there more
than 12 people?

00:35:35.524 --> 00:35:37.850 align:middle line:84%
He said, let me
ask you a question.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.094 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about ESP?

00:35:39.094 --> 00:35:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And the guy didn't
have an answer.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:41.350 align:middle line:90%
He said, look.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Unless you understand
about ESP and how it works,

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.260 align:middle line:84%
you will not be taken
in by the control group.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Very few people understand.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:49.045 align:middle line:90%
That was 1991.

00:35:49.045 --> 00:35:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty dramatic.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And I had no
idea until that download.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.322 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly in that
download in 2012,

00:35:55.322 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I go, oh, that's what
he's talking about.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.090 align:middle line:84%
It was like I had
put it together.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this is what
he was talking about.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And then two years later, the
third piece of the puzzle--

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Walker was 1991.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.010 align:middle line:84%
In 1993, Ben Rich, the head
of Lockheed Skunk Works,

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:84%
is at UCLA, giving a lecture
to the engineering alumni.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And Jan Harzan is in there
with his buddy, Keller.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And at the last slide he
shows is a flying saucer.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we now have the
technology to take ET home.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.999 align:middle line:84%
And Harzan looks at
Keller, and he says,

00:36:21.999 --> 00:36:23.290 align:middle line:90%
did you just hear what he said?

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe that?

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.722 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you
know that Jan Harzan

00:36:26.722 --> 00:36:28.930 align:middle line:84%
had this experience at nine
years old in his backyard

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.070 align:middle line:90%
with a flying saucer.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.787 align:middle line:84%
And he was obsessed
with flying saucers.

00:36:31.787 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted to build
a flying saucer.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And he became an
electrical engineer.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:35.973 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To do that.

00:36:35.973 --> 00:36:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: To do that, and he
realized, this is my chance.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So Ben is leaving the building
after answering questions.

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:41.680 align:middle line:90%
And he realizes, I've got to go.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.760 align:middle line:90%
And he chases Ben.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Ben,
I've been obsessed

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.426 align:middle line:90%
with this for my whole life.

00:36:45.426 --> 00:36:46.330 align:middle line:90%
I need to know.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:47.205 align:middle line:90%
How do they get here?

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:49.150 align:middle line:84%
How does their
propulsion system work?

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.141 align:middle line:90%
And Ben turns around.

00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And he says exactly what
Walker said two years before.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, let me
ask you a question.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.470 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about ESP?

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it means everything
in time and space is connected?

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that's how
it works, and walks out

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:02.440 align:middle line:90%
of the building.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So when this woman tells
me you use your mind,

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:90%
this is the thing.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the connection
to the whole thing.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.650 align:middle line:90%
It's this consciousness thing.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And even Tom DeLonge, if
you look at Tom DeLonge,

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.570 align:middle line:84%
he says he has the meeting
at Lockheed Skunk Words.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:14.509 align:middle line:90%
He gets in there.

00:37:14.509 --> 00:37:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And he's talking to them.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.550 align:middle line:90%
And he's ready to leave.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And they say, where
are you going?

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I thought
the meeting was over.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.250 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, sit down.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they had more.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And the head
scientist is there.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how
do they get here?

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:24.720 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.220 align:middle line:90%
And he tells them this idea.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, that's
a pretty good idea.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.990 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:29.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, I think
consciousness is involved.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the head
scientist at Lockheed

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:90%
says, now you're talking.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said that's all the head
scientist wanted to talk about.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So this confirmed
my download in 2012,

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.060 align:middle line:84%
that this is a key component
of this whole thing.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that comes
to the portal, it's

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:47.970 align:middle line:84%
this idea that it's this
interdimensional thing.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.650 align:middle line:84%
It may not be nuts
and bolts the way

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.630 align:middle line:90%
we think it's nuts and bolts.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are all
these great musicians

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.415 align:middle line:90%
interested in consciousness?

00:37:55.415 --> 00:37:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL MCCARTNEY: And I
had a piano by the bed.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And I just woke up one morning
with this tune in my head.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.730 align:middle line:90%


00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I don't
know this tune.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Or do I?

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.730 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, an old
jazz tune or something,

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.896 align:middle line:84%
because my dad used to know
a lot of old jazz stuff.

00:38:08.896 --> 00:38:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe I've just
remembered it or something.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.710 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.741 align:middle line:90%


00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:15.240 align:middle line:84%
I sort of got up,
went to the piano,

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.510 align:middle line:90%
and found the chords to it.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:20.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was, like, in
G, F sharp, minor, seventh,

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.460 align:middle line:90%
sort of B in there.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of just remembered
it, made sure I remembered it.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I just hocked it round
to all my friends and stuff

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.378 align:middle line:90%
and said, what's this?

00:38:31.378 --> 00:38:32.836 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's got
to be something.

00:38:32.836 --> 00:38:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, a good,
little tune, you know.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't have written
it because I just dreamed it.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.717 align:middle line:84%
You know, you don't
get that lucky.

00:38:37.717 --> 00:38:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Former
Beatle Paul McCartney,

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.185 align:middle line:84%
who had a consciousness
experience in a dream state.

00:38:42.185 --> 00:38:43.560 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: And I
wrote about that

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.330 align:middle line:10%
in a book called
"Inspired, the Paranormal

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.710 align:middle line:10%
World of Creativity."

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:48.900 align:middle line:10%
And in there, I talk about
some of his other dreams.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.930 align:middle line:10%
He had the dream,
"Let it Be," which

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:10%
was number 1 for 11 weeks
in the United States,

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:54.960 align:middle line:10%
one of the top
songs of all times.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We was very
influenced by that song.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And everybody
thought it was the Mother Mary,

00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:90%
and it's not.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:10%
His mother, whose
name was Mary, who

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:10%
died when he was 13
years old of cancer,

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.480 align:middle line:10%
a troubling time in his
life at the late '60s when

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.820 align:middle line:10%
the Beatles were breaking
up, came to him in a dream.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said it was
so nice to see her.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.510 align:middle line:90%
And she said, it'll be OK.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Let it be.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And so in my book,
I put 150 songs

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.657 align:middle line:90%
that musicians got in dreams.

00:39:17.657 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same sort of thing.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:90%


00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
This idea is whether you're
a psychic or remote viewer

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:24.510 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is,
it's the ability

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to tune in, to shut
down the left brain,

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.210 align:middle line:90%
your voice that's talking.

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:31.950 align:middle line:10%
And that's why when
you have someone

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:36.000 align:middle line:10%
like Dr. Powell working
with autistic kids,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.480 align:middle line:10%
they have left brain damage.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.879 align:middle line:10%
So that's shut down.

00:39:38.879 --> 00:39:40.920 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like they're
meditating all the time.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.480 align:middle line:90%
And their right brain can do--

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can
compensate for that.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.756 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: --do
all the telepathy.

00:39:45.756 --> 00:39:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And she has this kid that does
162 numbers in a row, and just

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.960 align:middle line:90%
amazing stuff.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, to me, that's
the most amazing part,

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.770 align:middle line:84%
is realizing that it's
not a physical world,

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and that musicians
are tuning into it,

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:59.890 align:middle line:90%
artists are tuning into it.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter of
learning how to do this.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain
how consciousness

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.660 align:middle line:90%
ties into ufology.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Well, I
think the basic thing

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:11.280 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness is
primary, that it is not

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.300 align:middle line:90%
a physical world.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the dual-slit
experiment, where

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:21.030 align:middle line:84%
until there's an observer,
the wave maintains itself

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.740 align:middle line:90%
as a quantum wave potential.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.760 align:middle line:84%
As soon as there's an observer,
it changes to a particle.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So a particle does not
appear in time and space

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.040 align:middle line:90%
until there's an observer.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.390 align:middle line:90%
So consciousness is primary.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.160 align:middle line:10%
It's consciousness
that creates the brain,

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.368 align:middle line:10%
and not the other way around.

00:40:33.368 --> 00:40:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is primary,
and that's the whole idea.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.990 align:middle line:84%
If you remember the entangled
particle experiment,

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:41.654 align:middle line:90%
where you have one particle--

00:40:41.654 --> 00:40:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Einstein didn't believe this,
spooky action at a distance.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.009 align:middle line:84%
You have a particle here
and a particle there.

00:40:46.009 --> 00:40:47.550 align:middle line:84%
You change the spin
of this particle,

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and the other one will
instantaneously change.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's affected by it.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.625 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: That's
the whole thing

00:40:51.625 --> 00:40:53.730 align:middle line:84%
about what Ben Rich
was talking about, ESP.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:56.520 align:middle line:84%
What I think they're doing
is they're not flying, like,

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.750 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:84%
They're actually moving
like entangled particles,

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:84%
because they realize if
there's no time and space,

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.370 align:middle line:84%
as Jan Harzan has said, all
things in time and space

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.250 align:middle line:90%
are connected.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:07.890 align:middle line:84%
If it's just one, if
everything is one,

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.134 align:middle line:90%
it's like a giant hologram.

00:41:09.134 --> 00:41:10.550 align:middle line:84%
They're not flying
through things.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.830 align:middle line:84%
They understand you just
change part of the equation,

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and you can move from one part
of the hologram to the other.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that how
they're getting here?

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:17.484 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Yeah,
and that's where

00:41:17.484 --> 00:41:20.190 align:middle line:84%
you get this thing where
you ask experiencers,

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.700 align:middle line:90%
how do you fly the ship?

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Chris Bledsoe, if you ever
interview Chris Bledsoe,

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.680 align:middle line:90%
I have a five-minute interview.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.620 align:middle line:84%
He goes step by step
by step by step.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.120 align:middle line:90%
You put your hand on this thing.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.650 align:middle line:90%
It starts to change color.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.020 align:middle line:84%
The whole ship starts
to change shape and size

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:34.920 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like this.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And they all are
describing the same thing.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far advanced
is that from our technology

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:41.769 align:middle line:90%
today, a million years?

00:41:41.769 --> 00:41:42.935 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Here's the thing.

00:41:42.935 --> 00:41:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They could be absolutely
millions of years ahead of us.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Even if you take a
look at the beings,

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.990 align:middle line:84%
the number one reported
being is not a Grey.

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not an alien.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:52.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a ball of light.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So if it's a ball of
light, does a ball of light

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.472 align:middle line:84%
have toast and
eggs for breakfast?

00:41:56.472 --> 00:41:58.680 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean, it may not even
be a physical phenomenon.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.757 align:middle line:84%
That's where I ask
Betty Andreasson,

00:42:00.757 --> 00:42:01.840 align:middle line:90%
did it ever get any older?

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just a
ball of light that

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.190 align:middle line:84%
can change and come into
the physical environment

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.030 align:middle line:90%
and move back.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And we just can't move out
of the physical environment.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.716 align:middle line:90%
They can just move in.

00:42:08.716 --> 00:42:09.960 align:middle line:90%
They can move out.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So once you understand
that you can

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:84%
move through these
dimensions or consciousness--

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:17.624 align:middle line:84%
and even, like, Jim Semivan
is basically hinting.

00:42:17.624 --> 00:42:18.540 align:middle line:90%
This is consciousness.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.070 align:middle line:84%
The head of Lockheed
Skunk Works is saying,

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.403 align:middle line:84%
the basis of this thing, to
understand it, is conscious.

00:42:22.403 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
book "Managic Magic,"

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:27.540 align:middle line:84%
will we get that kind of
disclosure, as they continue,

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.820 align:middle line:90%
as you say, leak it out to us?

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: I think they're
giving us the key components.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, the one with the
consciousness thing,

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Tom DeLonge is bringing it out.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:36.960 align:middle line:90%
So is Chris Bledsoe.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So is Semivan's people,
stuff like that, the idea.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.710 align:middle line:10%
I don't think they're
ever going to do

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:46.710 align:middle line:10%
an outright disclosure because
they may not have the answers.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:49.305 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the book,
I give the 64 reasons

00:42:49.305 --> 00:42:51.180 align:middle line:84%
that they're not going
to tell you the truth.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you take a look at
what one of the CIA people,

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Kit Green, says
when he was asked,

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.639 align:middle line:84%
he said, what would you do
if you had to deal with it?

00:42:59.639 --> 00:43:02.180 align:middle line:84%
It's fine to sit on the outside
and say, they should do this.

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.270 align:middle line:90%
They should do that.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you suddenly
had this problem,

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.150 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to do?

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was, because
I had done all the presidents,

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I realized that Jimmy
Carter was adamant he

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.480 align:middle line:90%
was going to disclose.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.730 align:middle line:90%
And so was Gerald Ford.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And when they went
into the White House--

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it never happened.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: They never
even used the word UFO.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.041 align:middle line:84%
If you check the
presidential record,

00:43:20.041 --> 00:43:21.540 align:middle line:84%
they never used
the word UFO once

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:22.956 align:middle line:84%
when they were in
the White House.

00:43:22.956 --> 00:43:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And the question was, I
said, they're honest guys.

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:90%
What changed their mind?

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.427 align:middle line:84%
They must have told them
something to change their mind.

00:43:29.427 --> 00:43:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
wrote the 64 reasons.

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:33.154 align:middle line:84%
And you start looking at
the 64 reasons, I mean,

00:43:33.154 --> 00:43:34.320 align:middle line:90%
do we understand everything?

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.184 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to put
your cards on the table

00:43:37.184 --> 00:43:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and then find out you've given
the Russians the cards they

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.380 align:middle line:90%
want?

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And they've got
all the cards now,

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.001 align:middle line:84%
and you've only get
80% of the cards.

00:43:43.001 --> 00:43:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know the former
president, late president's

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:46.730 align:middle line:90%
son, Michael Reagan.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:50.340 align:middle line:10%
And Michael would told me that
his dad was a staunch believer

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:54.810 align:middle line:10%
in UFOs, saw one when
he was in a plane once,

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:58.200 align:middle line:10%
was obsessed with it, gave
that speech before the United

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.140 align:middle line:10%
Nations as well.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And if you
go to Shirley MacLaine,

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.249 align:middle line:84%
Shirley MacLaine was quoted
in a British newspaper.

00:44:05.249 --> 00:44:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And I went to Shirley MacLaine.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.310 align:middle line:90%
And I said, are you misquoted?

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And the answer came back,
no, I'm not misquoted.

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:12.237 align:middle line:84%
What she said is
Lucille Ball told her.

00:44:12.237 --> 00:44:13.320 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have a sighting.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.440 align:middle line:84%
He had an encounter
with an alien being,

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.370 align:middle line:84%
which makes him an
experiencer, the same

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.130 align:middle line:90%
as Jimmy Carter had a sighting.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Disclosure,
will it happen

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.910 align:middle line:90%
during this administration?

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.840 align:middle line:10%
>>CAMERON: What I've been
told is this administration

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.580 align:middle line:10%
has been picked.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.080 align:middle line:10%
But I do not believe
there will ever

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.300 align:middle line:10%
be an open, full disclosure.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
they're going to do

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.930 align:middle line:90%
more of the gradual disclosure.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.570 align:middle line:90%
I cannot see this happening.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But I have been told
that this president was

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.480 align:middle line:84%
picked for some sort of
major disclosure initiative.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.819 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this
president know he's the one?

00:44:47.819 --> 00:44:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: He has been briefed.

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:50.310 align:middle line:90%
I know that for a fact.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:51.180 align:middle line:90%
He has been briefed.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.250 align:middle line:10%
He knows.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:57.420 align:middle line:10%
And what Dr. Ronald
Pandolfi said

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.880 align:middle line:10%
is that "he is
open to disclosure,

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.255 align:middle line:10%
and he's against
disinformation."

00:45:01.255 --> 00:45:02.754 align:middle line:84%
That's a quote from
Ronald Pandolfi.

00:45:02.754 --> 00:45:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to
wrap this up, Grant,

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.770 align:middle line:84%
by looking at a clip
of then-President Obama

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:10.290 align:middle line:90%
before a Hispanic group.

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OBAMA: Now none
of this was easy.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.350 align:middle line:10%
There were some
tough years in there.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:17.070 align:middle line:10%
You had fiscal showdowns
and government shutdowns

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:22.140 align:middle line:10%
and pandemics and oil
spills and pirates.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.875 align:middle line:10%
Do you all remember the pirates?

00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:26.250 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the only
thing we haven't

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.333 align:middle line:10%
had to deal with is, like,
the asteroid, you know,

00:45:28.333 --> 00:45:31.890 align:middle line:10%
or the aliens.

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:33.728 align:middle line:90%
That's true, good point.

00:45:33.728 --> 00:45:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't have
mentioned the aliens.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.834 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once again,
he brings them up.

00:45:39.834 --> 00:45:41.250 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
something there.

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: And it's
going to maybe come down

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.974 align:middle line:84%
to someone like you who gets
an interview where you realize

00:45:45.974 --> 00:45:46.890 align:middle line:90%
what questions to ask.

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or I interview
you, because you get it.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Yeah.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Grant, thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: Thank you.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.154 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
information that you

00:45:53.154 --> 00:45:55.800 align:middle line:84%
provide and have provided
to us over the years

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.645 align:middle line:90%
has been absolutely stunning.

00:45:57.645 --> 00:45:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CAMERON: Beautiful,
thank you, sir.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I appreciate that.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:00.335 align:middle line:90%
>>CAMERON: I appreciate it.

00:46:00.335 --> 00:46:03.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's so great to have
people who are just prime UFO

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.850 align:middle line:10%
investigators, who are out
there, working on getting us

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:10.320 align:middle line:10%
the answers to that great
question, are we or are we

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.760 align:middle line:10%
not alone in the universe?

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:16.920 align:middle line:90%
