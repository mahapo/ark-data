00:00:05.024 --> 00:00:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.810 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.682 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.079 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.120 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:10%
You know, throughout my entire
history of broadcasting,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:10%
I've come across one
person, just one person,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:10%
who I call the human computer.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:84%
This person has an ability to
look at all kinds of events--

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:84%
technology, economies,
world events--

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and he puts it in a perspective
that not only we understand,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:90%
but he's extremely insightful.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.957 align:middle line:84%
Our guest today on "Beyond
Belief," Mr.Howard Bloom.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:90%
Howard, always a pleasure.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.331 align:middle line:90%
>>HOWARD BLOOM: Thanks, George.

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have talked so
much on "Coast to Coast,"

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:84%
yet this is our
very first time--

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: The very first time--

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --we meet directly.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: In person.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.861 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I wonder
if the next time we

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:84%
do "Coast to Coast,"
if it will even

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
give it a more different
flavor inasmuch

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:84%
as once you meet somebody,
you even feel closer to them.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: That's a very,
very good point-- bonding.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:10%
And bonding is very important.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:10%
You know that my
background is that I'm

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:10%
a scientist who ended up in
the rock and roll business,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:10%
because I wanted
to see what happens

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:10%
with mass passions, what
happens with mass emotions.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Mass emotions are the
forces of history.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And Adolf Hitler was
extremely good at manipulating

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.459 align:middle line:90%
these mass passions.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And if he could do it, the
good guys have got to do it.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to understand
those passions,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up in the field
that I knew nothing about, which

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.980 align:middle line:90%
was the rock and roll business.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And while I was there, one
of the things that I learned

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:84%
is that the most important
thing you can do,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:84%
if you're a rock and roll
artist, is go out on tour

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and perform in front of audience
after audience, after audience.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
exactly what you just

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
said-- when you meet
somebody in person

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
or you see them in
person, and you become

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
a part of an
emotional experience

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of that person,
that person catalyzes it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:84%
for you, you never want
to leave that person again

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:90%
for the rest your life.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
That person stays in your heart
for the rest of your life.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
So what you and I are doing
is crude approximation

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.545 align:middle line:84%
of what Prince or Michael
Jackson once upon a time.

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you were
in the music business,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:84%
did you come across an
artist that you still

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
believe to this
day may have been

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:84%
the most overwhelming
person you've ever met?

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Well, it
was Michael Jackson.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah!

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: And you would
think Michael Jackson, just

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:90%
a superficial pop star, right?

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.220 align:middle line:84%
No, he wasn't a
superficial pop star.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
When I was 10,
there were two rules

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:90%
that attracted me to science.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Rule number one was
the truth at any price,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
including the
price of your life.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.667 align:middle line:84%
You'd be willing to give up
your life on behalf of a truth.

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Rule number two was look at
things right under your nose

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.458 align:middle line:84%
as if you've never
seen them before

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:90%
and then proceed from there.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Michael Jackson embodied the
first two rules of science

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:84%
in a way I've never seen from
another human being in my life

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:90%
and never even expected to see.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.745 align:middle line:90%
He was beyond human.

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But beyond human in
a way we should all

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:90%
aspire to be beyond human.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.527 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's sorely
missed, sorely missed.

00:03:19.527 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:90%
What a great talent!

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.625 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: He's sorely missed.

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks ago,
there was another person

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:84%
that I've spent a little bit
of time with-- Elon Musk.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.720 align:middle line:10%
Elon Musk is the
head of SpaceX, which

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:10%
is the only private
company, in fact, it's

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:10%
the only company in the
world right now in America

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:10%
that can get Americans to
space in American vehicles,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:10%
it can get American cargo to--

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Heads up, Tesla
Motors came up with that idea.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: --and Tesla
Motors, exactly.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said to somebody,
one of the reasons

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that I was attracted
to Elon, one

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
of the reasons I had four phone
calls with him is because here

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.392 align:middle line:84%
I've spent my whole life looking
for the forces of history.

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And I could see that Elon
was one of those people who

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.177 align:middle line:84%
will be remembered
150 years from now.

00:03:57.177 --> 00:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And the person on the
other end of the phone

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
said, wait a minute, you're
forgetting about somebody,

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to know who.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.250 align:middle line:90%
He said, Michael Jackson.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, if Michael Jackson is
able to survive for 150 years,

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%
he does set a new standard.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:84%
When you come to
understand how deeply,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:90%
how intensely he could--

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day, we
were at his brother

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Marlon's pool house,
a little house

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.420 align:middle line:84%
out in the back
of the main house.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.082 align:middle line:84%
And it's a house
much smaller than--

00:04:22.082 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But, was this
before, Howard, he

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.215 align:middle line:84%
started doing all this
heavy plastic surgery?

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Or what that ongoing?

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: It was, no, he looked
like a perfectly normal person

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.970 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And so they've got
an appointment,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
it's a little room, and there's
a pool table in the middle.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are all
these arcade games

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
around the sides of the
room, the kinds of games

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:90%
only billionaires can afford.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And the guys had a meeting
with the art director

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:90%
from CBS Records.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, Michael came
shortly before the meeting

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.816 align:middle line:90%
with the art director.

00:04:51.816 --> 00:04:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I had learned a
lesson, I grew up

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
among Guinea pigs and laboratory
rats, not human beings,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:84%
so I don't understand
human rituals.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.731 align:middle line:84%
But I had through
observation noticed

00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:01.230 align:middle line:84%
that when you meet
a new person, you

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.604 align:middle line:84%
walk over, you
put your hand out,

00:05:02.604 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and you say, hi,
your name is Howard.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So the screen door
began to open.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I walked over and
put my hand out,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and said, "Hi, my
name is Howard."

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I had read thousands of
articles on Michael by then.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.756 align:middle line:84%
They all said he
was a bubble baby.

00:05:13.756 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:90%
They all said--

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He didn't touch people?

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.848 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: No, that
he would retract,

00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that he'd shy away
from your hand.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:90%
No, he put out his hand.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a hard grip,
it wasn't a soft grip.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.030 align:middle line:90%
It was a normal grip.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:90%
It was a human grip.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.990 align:middle line:90%
And said, "Hi, I'm Michael."

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And I had a press release I
wanted to get him to approve.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:90%
I told him.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, let's go up
to the second floor.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.220 align:middle line:84%
The second floor was just jammed
with equipment-- amplifiers,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:84%
keyboards, no place,
really, to sit.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:90%
So we sat on amplifiers.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:90%
I read him the press release.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And as I read it to him,
he started sliding down

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:84%
on the amplifier like
this, and his face

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
got more and more-- I
couldn't quite tell what.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I finished, he
said, "Did you write that?"

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I had.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:90%
He said, "That was beautiful."

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.574 align:middle line:84%
In other words, Michael
could see the craft

00:06:00.574 --> 00:06:01.615 align:middle line:90%
in the tiniest of things.

00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's right,
and it affected him.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we went down to
be with the art director.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.570 align:middle line:84%
The art director
came in with five

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.810 align:middle line:84%
of the most gorgeous
portfolios you've ever seen.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
These are America's
five top artists.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.272 align:middle line:84%
And she slid them across
the pool table at us.

00:06:15.272 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Michael and I were standing
next to each other,

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and the brothers were
standing around us.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:84%
When Michael started
to open the first page

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:84%
of the first portfolio, he only
got an inch open, and he went,

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.890 align:middle line:90%
oh.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he opened
another inch-- oh.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.026 align:middle line:90%
And then more-- oh.

00:06:32.026 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And what you could feel
in his body language,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
because he was
going orgasmic, it

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.902 align:middle line:84%
was as if he were having the
ultimate sexual experience,

00:06:37.902 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:84%
but he was having
it aesthetically.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In his head.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.593 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah.

00:06:40.593 --> 00:06:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And you could feel
that Michael was

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.540 align:middle line:84%
seeing the infinite in
the tiniest of things.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Everything that William
Blake ever talked about,

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.810 align:middle line:84%
when he talked about seeing
the world in a grain of sand--

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.976 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-ha, right there.

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Right there.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:90%
And it was so visceral.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.780 align:middle line:84%
It took over
Michael's entire body.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So that second law
of science-- look

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:84%
at things right under your
nose as if you've never

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.714 align:middle line:84%
seen them before
and then proceed

00:07:01.714 --> 00:07:04.650 align:middle line:84%
from there-- that's a
law of awe and wonder.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Michael was awe
embodied and personified

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:84%
in a way I had
never, ever imagined

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
a human on the face of
planet Earth could be.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he gave it
when he was on stage.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.300 align:middle line:90%
He gave it.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Which reminds me of what
happened several weeks ago--

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah?

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The hologram of
Michael Jackson at a concert.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It looked like he
was really there.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.907 align:middle line:84%
Are we going too
far with technology?

00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: No, we're not
going too far at all,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.399 align:middle line:84%
because, look, Michael's
ultimate task, for example,

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
was to bring the quality
of awe and wonder.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:84%
He felt God had given him that
capacity for awe and wonder.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:90%
He realized how unusual it was.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that since
God had given it to him,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that made it his
obligation to give it

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.121 align:middle line:90%
to his fellow human beings.

00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
What does that have
to do with technology?

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:90%
The Oculus Rift.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:84%
The Oculus Rift
is this big thing

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
that you wear on your head
that creates a total 3D

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:90%
virtual environment.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:84%
So you're no longer just doing
shoot-'em-up games in the wars

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
in the jungles of
Vietnam, you are there.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.730 align:middle line:84%
You are surrounded
by this thing.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.240 align:middle line:84%
All my friends in
the tech community

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:90%
are talking about it right now.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Think about this for a second.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:90%
You walk down the street.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.499 align:middle line:84%
You're in LA or Portland,
Oregon, or here in Colorado.

00:08:14.499 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And you decide to get on
the phone with a friend.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:84%
You've just had an emotionally
disturbing thing happen.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Your best friend
is in Beijing, just

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:90%
temporarily for a year or two.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, but gone.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, you
get on the phone

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and you talk to your
friend in Beijing.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
You realize what
evolution, what nature

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
would have had to go through
to give you the powers

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
to speak over a
distance of 12,000 miles

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:84%
and to hear what's going
on on the other end?

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would not have
happened in evolution,

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.913 align:middle line:84%
unless we did it telepathically,
of course, right?

00:08:39.913 --> 00:08:41.539 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Well, it
happened through us.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Evolution evolved us, and
we evolved these machines.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:84%
But these machines not only give
astonishing new powers to us,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:84%
they give astonishing
new powers to the cosmos.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, that seems like a slightly
overblown statement, right?

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, this cosmos has
already invented things

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.750 align:middle line:84%
like atoms and
galaxies, and stars.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:90%
And then it invented you and me.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And now that it's
invented through us.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Now that it's invented
the iPhone and the iPad,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:84%
that's given the cosmos itself
astonishingly new powers.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And since this cosmos is
all about the process--

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:90%
we call it evolution.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's the process
of discovering

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:84%
her own possibilities,
discovering her own potential.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And she discovers it through
the creatures that she creates.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.625 align:middle line:84%
And then those creatures in
turn discover new possibilities

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that upset and
upend her old ways.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Nature is all about
changing herself.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Nature is all about
reinventing herself.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Nature is all about
hoisting herself up

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.190 align:middle line:90%
by her own boot laces.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And she does it
through you and me.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:90%
So does nature want technology?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:84%
You bet, because
nature's always out

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
for the next radical
reinvention of herself.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got six
grandchildren, Howard.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: That is
amazing, George.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --two of them lived
in my Saint Louis house.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.563 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah?

00:09:50.563 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My son moved back
from Las Vegas with his wife

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:84%
starting his new
career, doing very well.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:90%
But they needed a place to stay.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Right.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.626 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they stay
at good old dad's place.

00:09:59.626 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So I've got a two-year-old and
a four-year-old living there.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm there,
they're there.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And they come running
into my room-- papa,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:84%
papa, papa, tickle me, tickle
me, jump on me, all that stuff.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
But I've noticed that they
have understood technology.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:90%
They walk around with iPads.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.319 align:middle line:84%
And the little two-year-old
uses her mother's smartphone.

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Fantastic.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.776 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she's
playing little games.

00:10:25.776 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:84%
She knows where all
the buttons are.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is absolutely
amazing watching

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.430 align:middle line:90%
them go through this scenario.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: But here's something
you really have to realize.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
We are born with twice as many
neurons, twice as many nerve

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:90%
cells in our brain as we need.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Because over the course
of the first four years

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:84%
or so, the cells that are used
and the cell assemblies that

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:84%
are used, they will
stick around vigorously.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.690 align:middle line:90%
They'll have vigorous health.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: The ones that aren't
used, that aren't tapped.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They shrivel up.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: They die.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.982 align:middle line:84%
It's called apoptosis,
pre-programmed cell death.

00:10:57.982 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unless they're used.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Unless they're used.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you give a child
an iPhone or an iPad,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:84%
cell assemblies are being used
that were never used before.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So those, the cell
assemblies that

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
are staying alive and
becoming part of the brain

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:84%
are cell assemblies that
in their own peculiar way

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:84%
were never used before in
the history of mankind, which

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.770 align:middle line:84%
means that by the time your
grandkids are six years old,

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:84%
they have brains utterly unlike
yours, utterly unlike mine,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:84%
utterly unlike any of
the brains that have ever

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.190 align:middle line:84%
existed on the face of
planet Earth before.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.912 align:middle line:84%
The technology has
become like fingernails--

00:11:31.912 --> 00:11:33.370 align:middle line:84%
a part of their
body, a prosthetic.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:33.995 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:11:33.995 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's made them grow.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's probably why
they're better at it than I

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:90%
am--

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: There's
another little fact.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --because those
cells are gone for me, right?

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Well,
there's a simple fact

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.184 align:middle line:84%
that there are books
like "The Shallows"

00:11:44.184 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
that say that all
these technologies are

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:90%
dumbing our kids down.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.235 align:middle line:84%
Once upon a time there
was a philosopher

00:11:48.235 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:90%
who said the same thing.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:90%
It was 300-400 BC.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:84%

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.800 align:middle line:84%
a hard time when they come back
home is because they were part

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.704 align:middle line:84%
of a very bonded unit, fighting
on each other's behalf--

00:17:45.704 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they miss that.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: They miss
that tremendously.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And you and I can have it, if
we know that we are striving to,

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.230 align:middle line:84%
now that we've been given
an extra 40 years of life

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:84%
by our great
grandparents, you know,

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:00.130 align:middle line:84%
if you'd been born in
1850, your life expectancy

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:04.730 align:middle line:84%
would have been 38.5 years,
born in 2000-- 78.5 years.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So if our great grandparents
could give us an extra 40

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.650 align:middle line:84%
years of life, we owe at least
an extra 60 years of life

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:90%
to our great grandchildren.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.220 align:middle line:84%
If our great grandparents
could give us

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:84%
35 points on the average IQ,
we owe another 40 or 45 points

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.510 align:middle line:90%
to our great grandchildren.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.350 align:middle line:84%
If our great great
grandparents could increase

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.390 align:middle line:84%
the amount of peace
by a factor of 9,

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.700 align:middle line:84%
we owe another
factor of 9 at least

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:90%
to our great great grandkids.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And unless we live
up to that, we

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
are failing the generations
beyond our time.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot
afford to fail them.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
If we know this, George,
that is a higher purpose,

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that is a transcendent cause,
that is a greater truth.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And it does things on behalf
of the very cosmos and nature

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.620 align:middle line:90%
that gave us birth.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
It expands nature and
the cosmos powers.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.262 align:middle line:90%
But we have to know that.

00:18:51.262 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I did a two-week
stint at the Pentagon

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:90%
when I was in the Navy.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.731 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Wow.

00:18:54.731 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I met
some great guys

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:90%
that had a great camaraderie.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And after the two
weeks, when I came back

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.540 align:middle line:84%
to my job, my civilization,
I missed that.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I missed that
feeling that we had.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We would work at the Pentagon,
we'd go out at night.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And we did that for
two solid weeks.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And we got to be really close.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I can only
imagine what it's

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:84%
like for somebody in Afghanistan
or Iraq, or in military duty,

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:90%
serving two years.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And then it's gone,
just like that.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:90%
That's got to be rough.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: It's like
withdrawal from heroin.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.859 align:middle line:90%
We all need to be bonded.

00:19:33.859 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
It's functional bonding,
is what I call it.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we bond
around having a common purpose

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and doing practical things to
work for that common purpose.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know from
just your involvement

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:84%
with radio all these years, you
go through periods of crisis,

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:84%
inevitably, when you're
trying to achieve a goal,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
even if your goal is
career advancement.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you go through
a crisis together,

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:84%
it pulls you
together in ways that

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.220 align:middle line:84%
give you a fellowship
that never ends.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:84%
We all need that,
but we need, again,

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
to experience it working on
behalf of a higher truth.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't feel
that pulling together

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.650 align:middle line:90%

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.850 align:middle line:84%
We had it during
the Kennedy era.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.865 align:middle line:84%
And we lost it when
he was assassinated.

00:20:09.865 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
we've gotten it back.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.698 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: No, Kennedy said
some very important things.

00:20:13.698 --> 00:20:15.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, ask not

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
or what your country
can do for you,

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.870 align:middle line:84%
ask what you can do
for your country.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has called
on us for that.

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.307 align:middle line:84%
I'm right now reading probably
the hundredth book on strategy

00:20:24.307 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever read.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:84%
There's one thing in
Western books on strategy

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:90%
that's never mentioned.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.930 align:middle line:84%
A higher truth is
never, ever mentioned.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most
important part of strategy.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And for all practical purposes,
we're in a never-ending war.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:90%
What is it a war for?

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:90%
A peaceful war.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:90%
It is a war for creativity.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:90%
It is a war to advance mankind.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.232 align:middle line:84%
It is a war to pull even
the poorest of people

00:20:47.232 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
up to the level that
would have surprised

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:90%
the richest of people in 1850.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.520 align:middle line:84%
There was this immensely
rich guy in 1850 in Britain.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:90%
And he was a technophile.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:90%
He loved technology.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had
technology then?

00:20:59.180 --> 00:20:59.888 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Oh, yes.

00:20:59.888 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And in 1850, he
was able to build

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:84%
a building made of
all glass and steel.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing looks
like a big greenhouse.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And was able to pull in
the latest next generation

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.660 align:middle line:84%
technologies from South America,
from Russia, from China,

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What could

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.131 align:middle line:90%
Like a wagon?

00:21:16.131 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: It was
called-- no, these

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:84%
were envelope
folding machines that

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:84%
would make 12,000
envelopes an hour.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
These were the machines
that made bridges,

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and the machines that
made railroad tracks--

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of
astonishing new things.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
This guy died at the
age of 42, because he

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a simple antibiotic
that any person, street person,

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.290 align:middle line:84%
can get if they managed to
make it to an emergency care

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:90%
facility.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:90%
He died.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:90%
His name was Prince Albert.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
His wife's name
was Queen Victoria.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, homeless
people have powers today

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that Prince Albert could
not achieve in 1850.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.930 align:middle line:84%
That's your job and
mine is to make sure

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that the next unimaginable
impossibilities come rattling

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.050 align:middle line:84%
around the bend to become
part of the human repertoire,

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.840 align:middle line:84%
nature's repertoire, and
the cosmos' repertoire.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Some time, either
while we're still alive

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:90%
or after we're gone.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But you and I have to
set the stage for that.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't realize
that that's our obligation,

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:90%
we don't have a reason to bond.

>>NOORY: We have more

the face of the Moon.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:10%
He had to use a Bic pen

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Buzz and I are friends.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I'm
getting on a plane,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force is flying
me down to Washington

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.720 align:middle line:84%
to talk about harvesting
solar power in space

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and transmitting it

these kinds of signals, right?

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And I get on the
plane and I hear

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
this voice, "Howard,
is that you?"

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it's Buzz.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.595 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm already seated next

We didn't have a

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:90%
It was assigned seating.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:90%
We get off.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.940 align:middle line:84%
We took that long, long
walk from the plane

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to the luggage
terminal together.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And I got off on a rant, George.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I tend to get very evangelistic

look, it's your obligation, it's
my obligation to make history.

00:23:29.735 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:84%
You and I wake up in the

that we're of no value to the

We're sure that we can't do the

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.310 align:middle line:90%
But hey, guess what?

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.037 align:middle line:84%
A couple of guys who had the
same kind of insecurities

00:23:44.037 --> 00:23:45.495 align:middle line:84%
you and I have,
who had depressions

00:23:45.495 --> 00:23:48.230 align:middle line:84%
that were even worse than
your depressions and mine,

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.120 align:middle line:84%
managed to save the
world once upon a time.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
They were Winston Churchill
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.490 align:middle line:90%
up against Adolf Hitler.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
If guys who had
dandruff, if guys

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.890 align:middle line:84%
who itched at
inappropriate times,

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
if guys who made strange
noises in the bathroom,

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:84%
if these people
could make history,

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
then it's your job and
my job to make history.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And Buzz, sometimes
you've had this,

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:84%
because you perform in
front of live audiences

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:10.680 align:middle line:90%
every one once in a while.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when you're
performing for an audience,

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
their pupils dilate, they open
wide, and their face melts.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:17.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're mesmerized.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.046 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, it's an
astonishing experience.

00:24:20.046 --> 00:24:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Buzz was like that.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.460 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't understand why.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I noticed for the
first time after years

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.252 align:middle line:84%
of knowing him that
his eyes were blue.

00:24:26.252 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I noticed for the first that
he was even shorter than I am,

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.882 align:middle line:90%
which is hard, really hard.

00:24:29.882 --> 00:24:32.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's good for
stuffing him into a tin can--

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah. it worked.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: --and sending
him into space, yeah.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.876 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:24:34.876 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: So when I was
finished, I was so embarrassed,

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:90%
it was ridiculous.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.639 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I
was telling myself,

00:24:39.639 --> 00:24:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Bloom, you idiot, don't
you realize this guy's

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.210 align:middle line:84%
been in history
books for 40 years?

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:84%
For three months I kicked
myself around the block

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:84%
for having embarrassed
myself in this way.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.430 align:middle line:90%
And then I realized something.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Buzz did the highest thing
that he could possibly

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.440 align:middle line:84%
ever do-- setting
foot on the Moon.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.270 align:middle line:84%
He was the spear tip of
a $120 billion project--

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.400 align:middle line:84%
so once-in-a-lifetime
experience.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:84%
When he came back
from the Moon, he

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:06.420 align:middle line:84%
went into a state of alcoholism
and depression for 10 years.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very hard for him
to find new purposes in life.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:90%
And we all need purpose.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.800 align:middle line:90%
It's back to that business--

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a letdown.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: --the
transcendent truth, yeah.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.750 align:middle line:84%
He needed that lecture
probably more than anybody else

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I've ever been
inspired to give it to.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But what a weird thing
for your brain, you know,

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
when you consider yourself to be
reasonably intelligent to take

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.450 align:middle line:84%
three months to figure out what,
apparently, your gut already

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:90%
knew.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.874 align:middle line:90%
Very bizarre experience, George.

00:25:32.874 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are these
trinkets all over you?

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.748 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: These are the
expansions of my powers,

00:25:36.748 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:90%
thanks to technology.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:84%
These are our prosthesis,
for all practical purposes.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:84%
These two things are
eight-hour recorders.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Back in when I was still
stuck in bed in 2000, 2001,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:84%
there was a very high-placed
advertising executive.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
She did the branding for Reebok
and Nike, and PlayStation 2,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.030 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of things.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And she used to come out
to the apartment once

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.391 align:middle line:90%
every three months.

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:01.060 align:middle line:90%
She was a huge fan of my books.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
know, your real art

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.374 align:middle line:90%
is verbal improvisation.

00:26:04.374 --> 00:26:06.540 align:middle line:84%
You have to start recording
everything that you say.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that sounds
ridiculously egotistical,

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:90%
but I followed her advice.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So these are eight-hour
recording devices.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're constantly
recording yourself?

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Everything.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, nobody ever will have
a chance to listen to it.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.125 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean,
what you and I

00:26:18.125 --> 00:26:20.588 align:middle line:84%
were talking about before
the show is on that thing?

00:26:20.588 --> 00:26:21.669 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Oh, those weird sexual
experiences of yours, George.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, thanks a lot.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.261 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: I promise
never to tell your wife.

00:26:27.261 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
12-minute gap there?

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: No, one goes on
before the other one turns off.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.010 align:middle line:90%
So there's no 20-minute gaps.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.085 align:middle line:84%
But this is a
pedometer, so that I

00:26:37.085 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:84%
can measure how far I'm
walking during the day.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, because you were
bedridden for how many years?

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.671 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: I was
bedridden for 15 years

00:26:42.671 --> 00:26:44.557 align:middle line:84%
and for five years
was too weak to speak

00:26:44.557 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
a single word of the
English language.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>You must just get excited
when you see I did a mile today.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yes, exactly.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And these are two
Kindles, you know,

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:84%
the Kindles read
out loud to me, so.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you go
through TSA security--

00:26:55.602 --> 00:26:56.185 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah?

00:26:56.185 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --do you have to
take all that stuff off?

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.408 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yes, it takes about
20 minutes to take it all off.

00:27:00.408 --> 00:27:02.660 align:middle line:84%
It takes about 20 minutes
to put it all back on again.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would not want
to be the guy behind you.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: No, I let
them go through.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:90%
I just make them go through.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But this stuff is
wonderful, George.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Just think, 20 years
ago, 30 years ago,

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.185 align:middle line:84%
before the Walkman, so
that's about 40 years ago,

00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:84%
you and I used to
walk down the street,

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and we were all by
ourselves, stuck

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.140 align:middle line:90%
in the loneliness of our skulls.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We didn't have phones.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.030 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have anything.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: That's right.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sometimes though--

00:27:22.265 --> 00:27:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yeah?

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.489 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --it was a
little more peaceful.

00:27:25.489 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: But peace is not what
it's cracked up to be, George.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Excitement is what
it's cracked up to be.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.105 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you like
this new technology?

00:27:31.105 --> 00:27:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Oh, I love
having information

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:34.960 align:middle line:84%
pouring through
me 24 hours a day.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, because I
was flying out here,

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.762 align:middle line:84%
I was away from my information
for roughly an hour.

00:27:39.762 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you freak?

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: Yes.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean things are
happening in rock.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.537 align:middle line:90%
I need to be on those things.

00:27:45.537 --> 00:27:46.370 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of things.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:90%
I need to be on them--

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's why I call
you the human computer.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.046 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: --minute by minute.

00:27:49.046 --> 00:27:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Right, that's why--
OK, nobody knows this,

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.740 align:middle line:84%
but we've got to tell
the audience this.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So George's producer
calls me, sometimes

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:90%
on 20-minutes' notice.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.975 align:middle line:84%
And in the old days, your
producer used to say,

00:28:01.975 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
do you know anything about
the following subject?

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
always answer yes,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.453 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not going to miss
going on the air with you.

00:28:08.453 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:84%
What does she think
I am, an idiot?

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So and then one night, it was
22 degrees in New York City.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.210 align:middle line:84%
I was stepping out
of the Tea Lounge,

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.880 align:middle line:84%
this huge club where I've
written three books now.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.940 align:middle line:84%
I was about to go for my
walk through the park.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And my way home, last
thing I wanted to do

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.539 align:middle line:90%
was take off my gloves.

00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:25.580 align:middle line:90%
The weather was horrible.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: And the phone rang.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
should I take it--

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you had to
take your gloves off.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: --should I take it?

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.911 align:middle line:84%
So I took the gloves off
and I answered the phone.

00:28:31.911 --> 00:28:33.785 align:middle line:84%
And it was Lisa Lions,
one of your producers.

00:28:33.785 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa said, do
you know anything

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.284 align:middle line:90%
about the movie "Avatar"?

00:28:37.284 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Lisa, I don't
have time to watch movies.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anything about it.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, kids
are getting suicidal

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:90%
after watching the film.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.776 align:middle line:90%
Do you know why?

00:28:44.776 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, of
course, I know why.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And I told her about
Anousheh Ansari's depression

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:84%
after she went up on
the International Space

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Station for roughly 10 days
and came back to Earth.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And up there,
there'd been peace.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:90%
And she could hold the world--

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tranquility.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: --in the
palm of her hand.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
now, she was going back

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.550 align:middle line:84%
to violence and hatred, and
road rage, and all these things.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.709 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa said, OK, can
you be on in 20 minutes?

00:29:06.709 --> 00:29:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're on.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: So I am usually on
with you after two hours.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do my
homework like crazy,

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.530 align:middle line:84%
because I want to give you
absolutely the best and most

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:90%
recent facts I can.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.454 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you always do.

00:29:17.454 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: But it's hard,
George, because you

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:23.372 align:middle line:84%
are a former news-- whatever
the news guy is called.

00:29:23.372 --> 00:29:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I
was the executive.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: Yeah, and so
you're so on top of the news

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:28.950 align:middle line:90%
that it's ridiculous.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.547 align:middle line:84%
Two nights ago or three
nights ago when we did Iraq,

00:29:31.547 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:84%
you already had half
the things that I

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:34.922 align:middle line:84%
was going to tell you
right in your report.

00:29:34.922 --> 00:29:36.046 align:middle line:90%
And you're always that way.

00:29:36.046 --> 00:29:38.600 align:middle line:84%
You always have facts that
are so right up to the minute,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.060 align:middle line:90%
it's ridiculous.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.393 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's what I do.

00:29:40.393 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: So running
the race with you

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and keeping up with
you-- very hard.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This has been fun.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.450 align:middle line:84%
In our next "Beyond
Belief," I want

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.217 align:middle line:84%
to get into a segment
called "Ask Howard."

00:29:50.217 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do
some things like that.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:52.942 align:middle line:90%
But what drives you?

00:29:52.942 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:90%
What keeps pushing you?

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: I love
knowing things, and I

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
love being a value to
my fellow human beings.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.825 align:middle line:84%
So I love taking
all this information

00:29:59.825 --> 00:30:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and pouring it through
the sieve, the leaky

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:02.800 align:middle line:90%
sieve of a brain.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:90%
It really is a leaky sieve.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And trying to see things
from points of view--

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.307 align:middle line:84%
it's that second
law of science--

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:11.140 align:middle line:84%
see things from points
of view they've never

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:84%
been seen from before, so
that you don't get blindsided.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.580 align:middle line:10%
And if I can successfully
do that for you

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.500 align:middle line:10%
or for the people at the Office
of the Secretary of Defense,

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:10%
because they pulled
me in, or any other,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.540 align:middle line:10%
or the press for the 11th
president of India, who also

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.990 align:middle line:10%
thinks I'm some
sort of something,

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.380 align:middle line:10%
and Buzz Aldrin, hey, I'm having
a good day, I'm having a ball.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.044 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you give
off a lot of energy.

00:30:36.044 --> 00:30:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BLOOM: But--
it's because you're

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:90%
giving me a lot of energy.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:84%
We get our energy
from the people

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:84%
who are kind enough to
listen to us and energize us.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.234 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, this stuff is so much
fun, George, it's ridiculous.

00:30:47.234 --> 00:30:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More to come.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Howard, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BLOOM: George, thank you.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:51.720 align:middle line:90%
And great to see you in person.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you know why I
call him the human computer.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:10%
And on our next "Beyond
Belief" with Howard Bloom,

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.540 align:middle line:10%
we're going to be talking
about all kinds of things that

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:05.310 align:middle line:10%
will fascinate you, including
a segment called "Ask Howard."

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.409 align:middle line:90%
Don't miss it.

00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:90%
