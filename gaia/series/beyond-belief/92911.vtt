00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.920 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.877 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.720 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.345 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:26.489 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.120 align:middle line:10%
and happy holidays to you.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.750 align:middle line:10%
And you know, with the holiday
season quickly upon us,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:10%
a lot of people get depressed
during the holiday season,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:10%
primarily because, of
course, they're alone

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:10%
or they've lost a loved one.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest on "Beyond
Belief" is Laura Lee.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
She's a psychic
medium, and she's

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:84%
going to help a lot of us who
have lost those we care about,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and try to get us through
this holiday season.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Laura, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LAURA LEE: Well,
thank you for having me.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good to have you.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.462 align:middle line:90%
You look great.

00:00:56.462 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Thank you.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.211 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All Christmasy
and everything else, huh?

00:00:59.211 --> 00:00:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yep.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.060 align:middle line:90%
in being a psychic medium?

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm told this happened
when you were really young.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know, it's
evolved over the years,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:10%
because it started happening
when I was really young.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.059 align:middle line:10%
I started seeing spirits, and
it scared the bejesus out of me.

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
know what it was?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: No.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:84%
No, I just thought it was
an experience everybody had,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.096 align:middle line:84%
But almost like that "Sixth
Sense" kid, having troubles.

00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see dead people.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Right, right.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, not knowing
exactly what it was.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And over the years,
it just developed.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it genetic?

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Did you get this
from somebody else?

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.660 align:middle line:10%
>>LEE: You know,
I found out later

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:10%
when I became a
professional that there

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:10%
was a aunt on my mother's
side that possessed the skill,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:10%
and she was kind of quiet,
under the covers about it.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Coming from the Midwest, it's
not really the status quo.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:90%
So she was a medium.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when this happened
and you were a little girl,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and you started-- did
you see dead people?

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Or did you feel
them or hear them?

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.289 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Just about all.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.664 align:middle line:84%
They would come to me, typically
in the evening hours, at night.

00:02:12.664 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In your room.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah, receptive.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.645 align:middle line:90%
Scared, scared, of the dark.

00:02:16.645 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not through
the closet, right?

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Not through the closet.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Very frightened of the dark.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So anybody who's out
there who has children

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.100 align:middle line:84%
who are scared of the
dark, don't discount it,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:84%
especially if they see
deceased loved ones.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.750 align:middle line:90%
That's typical of children.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, I
never grew out of it.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And my parents
didn't dismiss it.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.447 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is important.

00:02:41.447 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I think that's key.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
a lot of parents

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:84%
think that this is a kid playing
a little kid game or something,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and they try to
talk them out of it.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Yours did not.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: No.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Curious.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people in my
family have had the experience.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.812 align:middle line:90%
I think a lot of families do.

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what
I'm here to talk about.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
have these experiences,

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
but they don't want to
become-- they don't want

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
to be seen as weird or
crazy, so they kind of

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:84%
keep it under the covers,
kind of like I did.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I kept it under the covers
for many years, literally.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I would sleep at night with
the blankets up over my head

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and have a portal so
I could breathe, just

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to kind of keep them
out of my sphere,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:90%
so I could just kind of sleep.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.106 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, did you
share these experiences

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:90%
with your parents a lot?

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.152 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: A little.

00:03:29.152 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:90%
A little.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:90%
And it just gradually grew.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And I learned how to
manage it over the years.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How about
your girlfriends?

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Did you tell them?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I remember having a
major experience in college.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:90%
And my girlfriends dismissed it.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But years later, as I came
out as a professional,

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
kids I grew up with,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:84%
knowing that I had
this experience,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.585 align:middle line:90%
it didn't surprise them.

00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell me about
this metamorphosis.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
As Laura Lee, the kid
who had these psychic

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:84%
experiences and
then as an adult,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.200 align:middle line:90%
how did you flow into that?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: So about
my freshman year,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I had a really bad
addiction with food.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:90%
I had an eating disorder.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:90%
And it got the best of me.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It was something that I
didn't tell anybody about.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
And it's typical
with young girls.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was a bulimia,
anorexia type thing.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And I got really sick
come my freshman year.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And I had an experience
that transcended.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I probably had a death
wish, just like most kids

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:84%
do-- you know, with an
addiction to drugs or alcohol.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:90%
That was my vice.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:90%
And that transcended it for me.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I had a being, a light
being come to me,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like I was witnessing
an experience of afterlife.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.545 align:middle line:84%
And they shared with me I would
be doing this on a major scale.

00:04:57.545 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: It wasn't
scary at the time.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Then I realized there's nothing
to be fearful of, that all

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.180 align:middle line:84%
these beings-- it made sense
to me at that moment in time

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.320 align:middle line:84%
that spirits were coming
to me for a reason,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and all they wanted to share
is "I love you" pretty much.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed to
carry forth that message.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So I start doing it, but I
didn't become a professional

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
until some years later, after
I went through a lot of healing

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.700 align:middle line:84%
process to overcome my
addiction and to move forward

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.020 align:middle line:84%
in life so I would
embrace my life

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:90%
and embrace myself as I am.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.660 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's key.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, see what's fascinating
about this is is you

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
are a human being, so you're
subject to human frailties.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Things happen to us in our life.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, you're
a psychic medium giving people

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:90%
advice about that.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.082 align:middle line:84%
So you have to sometimes
separate the two.

00:05:52.082 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:90%
That's not easy all the time.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Well, especially when
you come from the Midwest

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.730 align:middle line:90%
and a place where--

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As I have.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Yeah, the Midwest that's
deeply rooted in Christianity,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's-- what's
the word for it--

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to speak to spirits
was almost blasphemous.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:84%
That's something
you shouldn't do.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that you just kind of

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
kept quiet in that
kind of community.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up in
Normal, Illinois.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Illinois?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.475 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:19.475 --> 00:06:20.391 align:middle line:90%
I know that area well.

00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: To the
paranormal from Normal.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.125 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's just something
you just didn't openly discuss.

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're lucky you
didn't get burned at the stake.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Exactly.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm pretty
much embraced.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was the
busting out period for you,

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
where you went from
the little girl

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
to the professional
psychic medium as an adult?

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:90%
What was that striking point?

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I think it was
that near-death experience

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I had at 18 in my freshman year.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And I just woke up,
and I saw heaven.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I just saw it.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's among us.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's it look like?

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: It's brilliant.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It's 10 times octaves
higher than ours.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.764 align:middle line:90%
It's among us.

00:07:00.764 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And we don't witness--

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there angels
on clouds with harps?

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: No, no, no.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not exactly like
that, although there's

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:90%
higher dimensions like that.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:84%
It's among us, and
we're present among it,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.280 align:middle line:84%
but we're so veiled from
it because of our baggage,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:90%
just like I was.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And to a degree, you try
to push it away and try

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:84%
not to-- try to resist
the love for some reason.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.870 align:middle line:84%
We've got a duality here on
our plane of existence, fear

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's so
much-- we're barraged

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:84%
by fear on a day-to-day
basis by media.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:90%
I hate to say it, but--

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:90%
That happens.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Media does it.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it could be filtered in by
our loved ones, even around us,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.710 align:middle line:84%
which is passed on from
generation to generation.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:84%
But the baggage keeps us
veiled from seeing it among us.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So there's multiple
dimensions among us.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.689 align:middle line:84%
And this dimension is very much
here among us and supports us.

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there a hell?

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: So, I think hell and
heaven are a state of mind

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:90%
that we can all grasp.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.325 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's free will.

00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:90%
It's choice.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:90%
So it's a state of mind.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in a hell here
in this physical existence--

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.912 align:middle line:84%
and let's say the addiction,
and your mind's in that space--

00:08:12.912 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't snapped out
of it and you cross over,

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
you could still very
well be in that space.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.550 align:middle line:84%
There's always a
hand out to help you,

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:84%
whether it's here in
the physical plane

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:90%
or on the other side.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
There's always some spirit
that's an angel in your life.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will be there.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.041 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Right.

00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:84%
That will be there when
you're ready to choose

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.762 align:middle line:90%
to take that walk over.

00:08:29.762 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You just have
to be smart enough

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:84%
or alert enough, I
guess, to accept that?

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.749 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Or you just
have to be ready,

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:36.659 align:middle line:84%
because I was ready at
that moment in time.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
I remember calling out-- I mean
verbally, out loud, I'm done.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:90%
I need help.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
I was at a point of just like
a lot of teenagers or anybody

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
who's at wits end
with their addiction.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's either
I'm going or I'm

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:84%
going to choose to live life
differently at this point.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Probably
you made your choice.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Right.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
walking this path,

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
even though I graduated with
a communications degree--

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
for a good reason,
which I didn't realize--

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which you applied
in your later life.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Yeah, I applied
a lot in my life.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Right, business and
communications, yeah.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.825 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's
totally applicable.

00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely
part of my path.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people,
Laura, call you,

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:84%
when you are doing
your radio shows,

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:90%
what do they want to know?

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
What do they ask
most of the time?

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: You know, oddly,
it's all about love

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:90%
usually, relationships.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And not only about
romantic relationship,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.920 align:middle line:90%
but relationship dynamics.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody's trying
to look for peace and joy

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.017 align:middle line:84%
in their lives and want
answers, how to get to it.

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.266 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: You know?

00:09:46.266 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And love seems to be
the high priority.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.569 align:middle line:84%
But you know, in the last recent
years with the economy busting,

00:09:53.569 --> 00:09:55.610 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people were
calling in about their jobs.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About their jobs, too.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah, which is very sad.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.071 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that people
are getting hit from all ends

00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Yeah, because we're
going through such an evolution.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
know what to do.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is-- we went
through the industrial age,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:84%
we're moving into
an intuitive age,

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I think, where people
are going to have

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:90%
to rely on their intuition.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
We rely so much
on computers now,

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle line:84%
we've given up
our power to that.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But intuitively, we've got to
embrace that part of ourselves

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
to navigate the changes
that are coming.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, here we are
near the holiday season.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Why do people tend to get
down during seasons like this?

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Speaking
about loved ones,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:84%
since we're on that
subject and getting down,

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I think the holidays bring back
some of those memories that

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:84%
are so core within
us, and being alone.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
losing a loved one,

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:84%
it can even be a severed tie in
a relationship and being alone.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:90%
And you're never alone.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
We always think we're
alone, but we're not.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we're grieving, it's
hard to see those hands reach

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
out to us, or somebody
calling us up,

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.080 align:middle line:90%
hey, come join the party.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:84%
We want to curl up and just
recoil and close off the walls

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:90%
when we're grieving.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of the fear.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Grief is part of the fear.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So we have to resist
the temptation to coil

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and take that hand
and go out and be

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
open and receptive to
embrace the people around us

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.735 align:middle line:90%
and live life.

00:11:40.735 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
you know, grieving

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
is part of the sad
part of living.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes, it is.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:90%
It is a human experience.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're stuck with it.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.371 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: It's a human experience.

00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, as all therapists
say, you have to go through it.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But the moment you become
conscious that you're in it,

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
you can change your mind and
choose another direction.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's being conscious.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a psychic
medium, do you

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.580 align:middle line:84%
deal more with those
on the other side

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
or the human being
trying to find out

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:90%
about those on the other side?

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Good question.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I think what it is
is the communication

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:84%
with the dearly departed
is to help the living live.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
death, I've always said.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:90%
It's about life.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
such thing as death,

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:84%
which is the fallacy, the belief
that we've been ingrained,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:90%
that there is actually a death.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:90%
We continue on.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Our spirit--

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
convinced we continue on?

00:12:35.508 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Oh, absolutely.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're not gonna
chuck out and that's it?

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: No, no, no.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.612 align:middle line:90%
We continue on.

00:12:41.612 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely
multiple-- we continue

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.706 align:middle line:90%
to recycle until we get it.

00:12:44.706 --> 00:12:46.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
I've had my doubts.

00:12:46.205 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:90%
I've had my doubts.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I'm sure.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.454 align:middle line:90%
I've been there, too.

00:12:48.454 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a human experience.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:84%
But we're spiritual
beings in this--

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've heard that
numerous times, having a show,

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Coast to Coast, that many
spiritualists come on and say

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:03.027 align:middle line:84%
that we're a spiritual
being having a limited

00:13:03.027 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:90%
physical experience.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:84%
It's probably a
fraction of time.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But as George Noory
and Laura Lee,

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
it's just a fraction
of a moment.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But we'll continue on,
probably in the same vein.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I think in many
multiple lives I've

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
been a scribe and a communicator
and a visionary for leaders

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and sharing this insights
for people and guide people.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you have
your finger on the pulse,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:90%
and that's a part of life.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Well, kind of
truth of the experience

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:90%
or truth of the situation.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
don't hear that message.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's just, again, because
which side of the fence

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.115 align:middle line:90%
are we nurturing?

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Are we nurturing the love,
or are we nurturing the fear?

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:90%
But we're all connected.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:84%
We're all of the same spirit,
one of the same spirit, which

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
is hard for people to
grasp because we see

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.027 align:middle line:84%
such a separation
between each other.

00:13:58.027 --> 00:13:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are going
to talk with somebody

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.570 align:middle line:84%
in a moment about
their experiences.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And what are you
going to do with that?

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I'm going
to share who I see

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and whatever messages come
forth for them in particular

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, the
spirits that surround them

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:90%
at this particular moment.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully I'll
pick up on the ones

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.670 align:middle line:90%
that they expect to hear from.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.545 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going
to do that when

00:14:23.545 --> 00:14:32.597 align:middle line:84%
we come right back
on "Beyond Belief."

00:14:32.597 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief."

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:10%
We've got the psychic medium
Laura Lee with us and Julie.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to
talk a little bit

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:10%
about Julie's life and
those who have crossed over.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Laura?

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:90%
So Julie, right-handed, right?

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:10%
And I usually start
out right, left-handed

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:10%
so I know who's on
what side of the family

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.319 align:middle line:10%
when I start to see
spirits come through.

00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But I have a female
that's coming off

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:84%
on the maternal
side that's standing

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.579 align:middle line:90%
in the position of the aunt.

00:15:01.579 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.149 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: OK, so on mom's side
of the family, correct?

00:15:06.149 --> 00:15:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.325 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: And her passing
just happened recently.

00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:08.941 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's a tall
gentleman alongside of her

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of thin in
stature that's behind her.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like maybe he
passed before her, OK.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:90%
And kind of thin.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like
there's a burial that's

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:84%
kind of where all of
them are together, OK.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I see-- I feel like
this was just recent.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I also get that
there's a loved one.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I know that she was
surrounded by loved ones

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.280 align:middle line:84%
before her crossing, but there
was lots of pain in her body

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
before she crossed, so
she wasn't completely

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:90%
coherent all the time, she says.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But the love and support,
she's so grateful for

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:90%
to help her transcend.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
she was afraid.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't think she was afraid,
even though she acknowledged

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that she saw things that
might have caused concern

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.115 align:middle line:90%
for people around her.

00:16:00.115 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.906 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes, she did.

00:16:01.906 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: OK, that
stranger thing, I

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.640 align:middle line:84%
don't think it was
a cause of concern,

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.210 align:middle line:84%
because I think she was
embracing that going

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:84%
to the other side because
she saw other loved ones that

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:90%
were around her.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: OK

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: And the other
thing, as I say this,

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I sense there's a female that
goes to her grave regularly.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And I see flowers
being laid down,

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and she's crying constantly
about her passing.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:26.987 align:middle line:90%
Is this a daughter?

00:16:26.987 --> 00:16:28.695 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIE: That could
be her daughter, yes.

00:16:28.695 --> 00:16:29.195 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:16:29.195 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like she wants her
to know that she's with her all

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:84%
the time and that she
hasn't left her side yet

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:84%
because she wants to
make sure she's settled

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.061 align:middle line:84%
and she's good with
this before she goes on.

00:16:42.061 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Is this her partner that's
on the other side with her?

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.735 align:middle line:84%
Because he's standing
right alongside of her.

00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIE: Her husband did pass
prior, but so did her brothers.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, I feel like
this is her husband,

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.750 align:middle line:84%
because he's right
alongside of her.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:90%
It's like a partner.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And he was waiting for
her, so he took her hand.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel like
behind her, there's

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:84%
also parents that are
standing behind her.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's a long
family line over there.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like there's a
connection between-- what

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:84%
shall I say-- like, grandmothers
or sisters right there.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.109 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: As far as your
line is concerned.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And she's grateful because you
were there constantly, too.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
She also shows me a
heart-type pendant--

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this
is on a necklace

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
or something like that--
that somebody wears

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that's close to her
that's been passed down.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.019 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to
make sure that's just

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.319 align:middle line:90%
confirmation to everybody else.

00:17:43.319 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: All right.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:84%
She loves you guys
so much, so sweet.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And I see that she
lost tons of weight,

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.489 align:middle line:84%
because she was gorgeous
when she was younger.

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.946 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: And I see that.

00:17:54.946 --> 00:17:57.070 align:middle line:84%
But she's telling me
she had such a struggle

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.610 align:middle line:90%
here at the end.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I say she
struggled, she's fine now.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
When she crossed over,
it was immediate.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:90%
She's at total peace.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think,
specifically, a daughter

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:90%
needs to know.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I also feel like
somebody had to travel

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.287 align:middle line:84%
far to get to see her
before she transcended.

00:18:17.287 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense, too?

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: This is
another family member.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.202 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:25.202 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so sweet, such
a caring person.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Such a caring person
I get with her.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:32.849 align:middle line:84%
I also get-- there's a
couple of other females

00:18:32.849 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:90%
that are coming in.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like there's
a Mary connection.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And I also feel like
there's a Michael or a Mike.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.644 align:middle line:90%
OK, now, Mike is--

00:18:40.644 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: My boyfriend.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Your boyfriend.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.218 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like it
might be related

00:18:44.218 --> 00:18:45.580 align:middle line:90%
to Mike, if that makes sense.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think Mike
believes in any of this,

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.066 align:middle line:84%
but I think they wanted to
come in and say hello about it.

00:18:51.066 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:52.481 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:18:52.481 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Mike probably is like,
this is totally not for me.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.679 align:middle line:90%
Don't even tell me, right?

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.719 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: But there's
a Mary connection

00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:84%
that's coming in
to say hello, OK?

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.232 align:middle line:84%
Oh, he would know, because I
almost feel, like, Mother Mary.

00:19:06.232 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIE: That's what came
to mind when you said that.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah, Mother Mary.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Let it go or "Let It Be,"
with-- that's what I think,

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:13.979 align:middle line:90%
a Beatles song?

00:19:13.979 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, and there's been talk about
marriage between you and Mike?

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:20.411 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:19:20.411 --> 00:19:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Yes, and I think that's--
I just want you to know,

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:84%
they're telling me that
it's like a divine union.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And your apprehension,
you'll move through it.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.241 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like there might be
a child involved or children

00:19:34.241 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:90%
involved?

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.770 align:middle line:90%
At one point, or there is.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:39.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense, that
they're talking about--

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.280 align:middle line:84%
but anyway, it'll be
worked through, OK?

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think you'll be
surprised because I think

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.301 align:middle line:84%
he's going to pop the
question, and you'll be like--

00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At least
you'll be ready for it.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Right.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:84%
I already went
over the surprise.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:90%
I gave it away.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big
will the ring be?

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.377 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Where will the ring be?

00:20:05.377 --> 00:20:05.960 align:middle line:90%
In his pocket.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Also, I get a connection
to another gentleman.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.580 align:middle line:90%
I hear a Richard or Dick.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Does this make sense,
if there's a Richard?

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
other boyfriend.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIE: You're not
supposed to tell.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah, shush.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Richard, Dick--
but I almost feel

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:84%
like this might be paternal
side on your right side,

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:90%
paternal side.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.546 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIE: No one's
coming to mind.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: OK.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I get the
sense that it's

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:90%
coming through on paternal side.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
It could even be related to
your boyfriend, Mike, OK?

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So you might want to
pass that on to him.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel like there's
a military connection.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like there's some
sort of planes or something

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:90%
to attract with planes.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.025 align:middle line:84%
It might even be a pilot
or something of that sort.

00:21:06.025 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any connections
or recollections of something?

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:09.858 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Nothing.

00:21:09.858 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Because I'm
getting a sense

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of that strong person
coming through as well.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there somebody in
the military right

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:90%
now in your family?

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.894 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIE: His father's
in the military.

00:21:19.894 --> 00:21:21.101 align:middle line:90%
Well, he was in the military.

00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: And who's that?

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Michael's father.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Michael's father.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Right, it's right there.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:90%
OK, so there's a confirmation.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm sorry to be pointing.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
But I know there was a
confirmation in there,

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:84%
but I feel like there's a
strong line right there.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.665 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry to keep
on Mike, but Mike

00:21:35.665 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:90%
seems to be coming through.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.822 align:middle line:84%
By the way, when
I get Mike, I also

00:21:38.822 --> 00:21:40.530 align:middle line:84%
get the association
of Archangel Michael,

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like
he's like a protector.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And he might be a
little bit-- seem

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
to have that energy of
wanting to protect and consume

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:48.740 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's just
kind of who he is.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to just
relax and let it be, OK?

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that's what he
wants to do all the time, OK?

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, I understand,
they're telling me, too, like,

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
you guys will fly off and go
do this on a spur-of-the-moment

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle line:90%
type thing.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Fun.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Vegas, here we come.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: The love chapel.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:84%
No, actually I think it's
something more tropical.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.510 align:middle line:90%
So I'll just put that to you.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:22.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Your aunt wants to come back
in and say something, too.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like
barely eating, and I

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:84%
feel like this was such a
concern of so many people,

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and her whittling away and
just recoiling and closing up

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.197 align:middle line:84%
like this as she
was passing over.

00:22:40.197 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like a little
baby-- and somebody

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:84%
told me, I think she's
communicating to me,

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:84%
somebody told her
it was OK to go.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.334 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to give
gratitude to that as well,

00:22:50.334 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like that might
be another family member,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:84%
although you were there
by her side as well.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But I see them taking her hand
and just stroking her hair

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and stroking her head,
because she was in and out

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:84%
with the drugs that
they were giving

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:90%
her to alleviate for the pain.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And she's also telling me
as the earrings-- there's

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.670 align:middle line:84%
some sort of earrings
as well that they

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:84%
might be wearing
off and on in order

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.240 align:middle line:90%
to confirm that message, OK?

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.452 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: OK.

00:23:20.452 --> 00:23:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: You'll be receiving
some of that jewelry

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:90%
as well, if you haven't already.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Wow.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: She also shows me
pictures on the phone.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Pictures on the phone.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:84%
You guys took pictures
and snapshots of her

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:90%
together before her crossing.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Do you have
them on your phone?

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:37.663 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: I do.

00:23:37.663 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:90%
She tells me.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any questions,
Julie, for Laura?

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.209 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.209 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIE: There's just
so many, but I'm just

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:84%
taking in everything
that you've been saying.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.223 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: I know.

00:23:49.223 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
She's really close
to you, because I

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.577 align:middle line:84%
think she wants everybody to
understand how happy she is.

00:23:56.577 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Good.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:90%
That's comforting.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: In the comfort
of her family right now.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.190 align:middle line:90%
And she's very happy.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Well, thank you.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
feel about knowing things

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:84%
about your family, that they're
on the other side, they're OK?

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIE: You know,
it's comforting.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:84%
There's just a lot
of peace with that.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.192 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I feel like I
knew that already, but--

00:24:21.192 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Reinforcement?

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:22.733 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yeah.

00:24:22.733 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a good feeling.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It makes me happy.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Laura,
when this comes to you,

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how did they find you?

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Or how do you find them on
the other side so quickly?

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I think when
a person invites me

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:84%
into their personal space,
it comes as a download,

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.400 align:middle line:84%
because spirits know I'm an open
door for them to come through.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Just like there's
other people out there

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.850 align:middle line:84%
who aren't professionals
and might have spirits come

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:84%
to them all the time, but they
won't share those messages.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I just have allowed myself to
share, step up to the plate

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and be that vehicle for the
spirits to come through.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:90%
So they show me images.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they'll talk to me.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's not as clear
as you and I here.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a radio
tune-in dial type thing.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they'll
show me snapshots,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.600 align:middle line:84%
they'll show me
pictures, long visions.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's hearing.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's a feeling.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, the overwhelming
feeling of

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.655 align:middle line:84%
love I have for some
of my recipients

00:25:26.655 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
that are sitting before
me, I almost cry for them,

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%
because it's not crying
for the dearly departed.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.269 align:middle line:90%
They're in a good space.

00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:90%
They're in a really good space.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it ever get
emotional for the recipient?

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yeah, it does.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.060 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And actually sometimes I'll end
up crying for the recipient,

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.800 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
person who's suffering.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the person who
needs to embrace life,

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:90%
to move through the grief.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a typical
traditional therapist

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:84%
doesn't help, so
I consider myself

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.770 align:middle line:84%
as an alternative
grief therapist,

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:90%
because sometimes it works.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.176 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they ever
broken down in front of you?

00:26:01.176 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Oh, yes.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:02.349 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:02.349 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, usually we're
always carrying

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:90%
around boxes of Kleenex.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I have box of
Kleenexes for people.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel
like crying, Julie?

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.377 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIE: Not out
of sadness, but--

00:26:12.377 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out of glee, happiness?

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.414 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIE: Yes, I feel myself
tearing up a little bit.

00:26:16.414 --> 00:26:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, during
the holiday season

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:90%
it's important to do this.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully Mike will
get that message, too,

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.159 align:middle line:84%
so you'll have to turn
on the TV for him.

00:26:24.159 --> 00:26:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Yes.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.699 align:middle line:90%
I'll be sure to do that.

00:26:25.699 --> 00:26:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Laura, if more people
want information about you

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.046 align:middle line:84%
and what you do, how
do they find you?

00:26:30.046 --> 00:26:32.045 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: They can go to
psychicmediumlauralee.com.

00:26:32.045 --> 00:26:35.200 align:middle line:90%


00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Or mediumlauralee.com,
and I'll pull up.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
had any experiences

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.200 align:middle line:84%
that have been difficult
for you and tough for you

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:90%
as a psychic medium?

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Missing children, for sure.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not easy.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Especially
as a mom, yeah.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I think I've worked
on a couple of cases

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.630 align:middle line:84%
where I've put on-- because
I'm an emotional eater.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.213 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I still
battle with that.

00:26:59.213 --> 00:27:01.296 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're an emotional
wreck anyways, right?

00:27:01.296 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Well, when you're dealing
with children that have been

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.075 align:middle line:90%
abused or--

00:27:05.075 --> 00:27:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Disappeared?

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Disappeared, yeah.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.059 align:middle line:84%
And I can't get
close to the family.

00:27:09.059 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I have to deal with
law enforcement direct.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.895 align:middle line:84%
But still, regardless,
that's still emotional.

00:27:13.895 --> 00:27:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So primarily,
you're with law enforcement?

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:16.765 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Yes.

00:27:16.765 --> 00:27:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if
you see something

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.464 align:middle line:84%
that is not very good, do
you tell them straight out?

00:27:21.464 --> 00:27:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Oh, yeah.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:23.463 align:middle line:90%
With law enforcement, it's easy.

00:27:23.463 --> 00:27:23.963 align:middle line:90%
Family, no.

00:27:23.963 --> 00:27:25.254 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Family it's difficult.

00:27:25.254 --> 00:27:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: No, no.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.282 align:middle line:84%
Because they so want to
see that person standing

00:27:29.282 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:90%
right there in front of them.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a psychic who
has now joined the other side,

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.015 align:middle line:84%
she's passed on, who would
tell family members--

00:27:37.015 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: I know who
you're talking about.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that their loved
ones were dead or gone.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And then strangely, some
of them would show up

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.990 align:middle line:90%
alive years and years later.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:48.915 align:middle line:90%
That was a little irresponsible.

00:27:48.915 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: Well, I know who
you're talking about.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.498 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to your
producer about that.

00:27:52.498 --> 00:27:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And she never claimed
to be a medium.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:56.617 align:middle line:90%
She claimed to be a psychic.

00:27:56.617 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:90%
And there is a difference.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.325 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:27:58.325 --> 00:27:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Big difference.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.467 align:middle line:84%
>>LEE: And a lot of
people don't understand.

00:28:01.467 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:10%
And I think she just might
have jumped on the bandwagon,

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.030 align:middle line:10%
because there's so much
hoopla around mediumship

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.640 align:middle line:10%
right now with media.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:10%
But all mediums are psychic,
but not all psychics

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.700 align:middle line:10%
are mediums, if
that makes sense.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.260 align:middle line:10%
So mediums just use
a tool of divination

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.160 align:middle line:10%
to speak about the past,
present, and future for people

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.910 align:middle line:10%
by speaking to spirits.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:26.020 align:middle line:84%
But some psychics use tarot,
they can use a pendulum,

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.650 align:middle line:84%
they can use
psychometry, just holding

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
onto an object of
something for someone.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.730 align:middle line:84%
My tool, although I love
all those tools-- I've got,

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:39.780 align:middle line:84%
like, 20 tarot decks on my
coffee-- is the mediumship,

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:90%
is speaking to the spirits.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
deliver my information,

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:84%
whether it's about the
relationships or work, health

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.110 align:middle line:84%
issues-- which I'm not a doctor
by any sense of the means.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.247 align:middle line:84%
I always tell
everybody to follow up.

00:28:56.247 --> 00:28:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.038 align:middle line:90%
Which is a smart thing to do.

00:28:58.038 --> 00:29:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Right, right.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:84%
But spirit will
just give me what

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I need to know in
that particular moment

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.125 align:middle line:90%
for that person.

00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, great.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to both of you for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.528 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE: Thank you.

00:29:09.528 --> 00:29:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>JULIE: Thank you.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In our next
edition of "Beyond Belief,"

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:10%
psychic medium Laura
Lee will be talking

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.780 align:middle line:10%
about the angelic side of life.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
happy holidays to you.
