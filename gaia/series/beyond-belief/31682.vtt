00:00:30.018 --> 00:00:32.587 align:middle line:84%
>> And now the host of the
Nationally Syndicated Coast

00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:37.526 align:middle line:84%
to Coast AM and Gaiam TV bring
you Beyond Belief with George

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:38.326 align:middle line:90%
Noory.

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>George Noory: Well hello!

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.495 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:43.351 align:middle line:84%
You know, people from
all walks of life

00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:45.566 align:middle line:84%
have been reported
that they're seeing

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.225 align:middle line:84%
UFOs, flying objects
in the skies, law

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:51.339 align:middle line:84%
enforcement, astronauts,
people from all walks of life.

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:52.907 align:middle line:90%
What the heck are they?

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:54.537 align:middle line:84%
So we thought on
Beyond Belief, we'd

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:56.511 align:middle line:84%
bring in a very
special investigator.

00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:59.113 align:middle line:84%
She is an Italo
American journalist,

00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:00.315 align:middle line:90%
please welcome Paola Harris.

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:01.115 align:middle line:90%
Paola.

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:03.885 align:middle line:84%
[Applause] >>George
Noory: How are you?

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:05.486 align:middle line:90%
>>Paola Harris: Good to see you.

00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>George Noory: Good to see you.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.221 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat.

00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:08.966 align:middle line:90%
My Italian Bella bella...

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.258 align:middle line:90%
>>Paola Harris: Grazie, grazie.

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:11.192 align:middle line:84%
>>George Noory: What
does it mean by the way?

00:01:11.192 --> 00:01:12.594 align:middle line:84%
>>Paola Harris: It
means beautiful,

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:13.624 align:middle line:84%
beautiful that's
what Italians use

00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:14.863 align:middle line:90%
when they see women in Rome.

00:01:14.863 --> 00:01:17.765 align:middle line:84%
I just came back yesterday
by the way, got me

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:19.167 align:middle line:90%
just as I came back from Italy.

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:20.602 align:middle line:90%
I've been there for one month.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:25.007 align:middle line:84%
I was in Italy and in Belgium
and I'm doing a lot of work

00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:25.807 align:middle line:90%
internationally.

00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:28.298 align:middle line:84%
>>George Noory: What are you
doing these days in Italy

00:01:28.298 --> 00:01:28.776 align:middle line:90%
specifically?

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:30.715 align:middle line:84%
>>Paola Harris: Well,
what I did specifically

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:33.533 align:middle line:84%
was I had to give the Italians
an update as to what's

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.116 align:middle line:84%
happening with UFOs
because, you know,

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:38.305 align:middle line:84%
what they say is we're not
seeing anything that means

00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:41.360 align:middle line:84%
they are not coming here and
all this, but what's happening

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.822 align:middle line:84%
is that we had two major events
here in the United States

00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:48.942 align:middle line:84%
and you know what they were,
they were the Sirius movie,

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:53.701 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Steven Greer, he released a
film, it's not just about UFOs,

00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:56.337 align:middle line:84%
it's about free
energy and so forth

00:01:56.337 --> 00:01:58.283 align:middle line:84%
and then the Citizen
Hearing in April,

00:01:58.283 --> 00:01:59.674 align:middle line:90%
which was major big time.

00:01:59.674 --> 00:02:01.928 align:middle line:84%
I think that that
was, I attended

00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:04.579 align:middle line:84%
that, I, I sat in the front
row at the Citizen Hearing

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.881 align:middle line:84%
in Washington DC, I didn't
even go to the bathroom,

00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:10.481 align:middle line:84%
it was so powerful, and I
had to report that to Europe

00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:13.095 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, there
they don't understand,

00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:15.014 align:middle line:84%
they don't watch,
they're not going

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:16.791 align:middle line:84%
to watch a live
streaming in English,

00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:20.128 align:middle line:84%
and that was live streamed,
so in the lectures

00:02:20.128 --> 00:02:23.031 align:middle line:84%
that I did I talked about
things, yes, they do happen,

00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:25.311 align:middle line:84%
we're still having
sightings, and by the way,

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.169 align:middle line:84%
there are some of us out there
that are trying to get this out

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:29.704 align:middle line:90%
and that includes George.

00:02:29.704 --> 00:02:30.504 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:32.087 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: You know, I
had a chance to talk

00:02:32.087 --> 00:02:34.842 align:middle line:84%
to Peter Davenport from the
National UFO Reporting Center

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:37.058 align:middle line:84%
and he said he has
never seen a time where

00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:41.549 align:middle line:84%
he is getting more reports
into the UFO Center about UFOs

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:42.917 align:middle line:90%
and sightings.

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:45.186 align:middle line:84%
I think one of several
things might be happening.

00:02:45.186 --> 00:02:48.616 align:middle line:84%
One, maybe we're testing
a lot of drones and people

00:02:48.616 --> 00:02:50.992 align:middle line:84%
are seeing these strange
objects in the sky.

00:02:50.992 --> 00:02:53.995 align:middle line:84%
Or two, we're getting
more visitations.

00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:56.215 align:middle line:84%
If we're getting
more visitations,

00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:58.466 align:middle line:84%
Paola, what do you
think is going on?

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:00.535 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Well, I think there
is a third one George,

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:03.237 align:middle line:84%
and that is there is an
awareness because if everybody,

00:03:03.237 --> 00:03:07.141 align:middle line:84%
if all those people were
looking into the live streaming

00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:08.899 align:middle line:84%
of the Citizen
Hearing that there

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.846 align:middle line:84%
could be more awareness of
looking up to the skies.

00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:13.247 align:middle line:90%
What do I think is going on?

00:03:13.247 --> 00:03:16.617 align:middle line:84%
There is a heightened awareness
and of course we have drones...

00:03:16.617 --> 00:03:17.452 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Sure...

00:03:17.452 --> 00:03:17.986 align:middle line:90%
>>PH: And, and, you know, the...

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:19.053 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Many.

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Many, in fact,
the Alitalia pilot,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.312 align:middle line:84%
and I have to say, it was an
Italian pilot that reported

00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:24.759 align:middle line:90%
the drone near the...

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.396 align:middle line:90%
at JFK when he flew in...

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:27.729 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Almost hit him, didn't it?

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah, almost hit
him, and I was thinking

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.989 align:middle line:90%
was that really a drone?

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:31.789 align:middle line:90%
Was that?

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:90%
What could that have been?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.671 align:middle line:84%
I mean are they calling
even UFOs drones?

00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:39.474 align:middle line:84%
How do we know the difference
between a drone and a UFO?

00:03:39.474 --> 00:03:43.111 align:middle line:84%
So that gets to be in my
area of excel, politics,

00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:45.346 align:middle line:90%
our stuff or their stuff?

00:03:45.346 --> 00:03:46.614 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Right.

00:03:46.614 --> 00:03:49.556 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: So yeah, so there's maybe,
there's more drones and then

00:03:49.556 --> 00:03:52.696 align:middle line:84%
the idea that there could
be more sightings if people

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:55.289 align:middle line:84%
are more aware of
it, you know, I mean,

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:56.991 align:middle line:90%
they're looking up in the skies.

00:03:56.991 --> 00:03:59.274 align:middle line:84%
I mean how many people
walk around looking down

00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:00.194 align:middle line:90%
instead of up?

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:02.783 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Well, what fascinates
me about these cases

00:04:02.783 --> 00:04:06.878 align:middle line:84%
though not just the drone size
visitations that they see,

00:04:06.878 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
but these huge
triangular shaped objects

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.075 align:middle line:84%
that are in some cases people
are estimating a mile long.

00:04:14.075 --> 00:04:17.412 align:middle line:84%
Now can you imagine looking
at an object in the sky a mile

00:04:17.412 --> 00:04:18.212 align:middle line:90%
long?

00:04:18.212 --> 00:04:22.784 align:middle line:84%
I mean we look at a plane that's
4 or 500 feet long, right,

00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:26.387 align:middle line:84%
but can you believe
a mile long UFO.

00:04:26.387 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't have
one of those here, right?

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.191 align:middle line:90%
They're not ours.

00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:32.816 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: No, I don't think they're
ours, and you know, we had one,

00:04:32.816 --> 00:04:35.085 align:middle line:84%
I was in Belgium too and
there was a major Belgium

00:04:35.085 --> 00:04:38.099 align:middle line:84%
sighting that had a triangle
and it was photographed.

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.448 align:middle line:84%
I think, I think who
goes crazy about this

00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:43.271 align:middle line:84%
is the military because they
can't do anything about it.

00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So, and that was
the Belgium military

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.576 align:middle line:90%
that that a really sad story.

00:04:48.576 --> 00:04:52.936 align:middle line:84%
Just as the Mexican military
asked Jaime Maussan to help

00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:57.151 align:middle line:84%
them with the Campeche case with
the three lights over Campeche

00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:00.255 align:middle line:84%
and I think that
I, I really think

00:05:00.255 --> 00:05:03.357 align:middle line:84%
that whatever is out there
doesn't need to be tiny.

00:05:03.357 --> 00:05:07.662 align:middle line:84%
I mean people are reporting, you
know, football size whatevers

00:05:07.662 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:90%
and they could be entire cities.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.998 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let your
imagination work.

00:05:10.998 --> 00:05:13.034 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Maybe there's some
other ship up there,

00:05:13.034 --> 00:05:16.237 align:middle line:84%
just flying around the planet
and these objects come down

00:05:16.237 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and go back up again, possible?

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.652 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: I think absolutely,
if you study ufology,

00:05:21.652 --> 00:05:24.779 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hoping that a lot of
people do more academic study,

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and since I'm a teacher, I
really want that to happen.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.113 align:middle line:84%
The sightings are
huge craft, I mean

00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:34.803 align:middle line:84%
there are some photos of huge
craft, so maybe there are,

00:05:34.803 --> 00:05:37.928 align:middle line:84%
and, and when we
say the mother ship,

00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:41.195 align:middle line:84%
yeah, there's maybe the
mother ship from one group,

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:43.431 align:middle line:84%
but I think there are
several groups, don't you?

00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:44.732 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Possibly.

00:05:44.732 --> 00:05:46.908 align:middle line:84%
But why is science,
why do they seem

00:05:46.908 --> 00:05:49.837 align:middle line:84%
to be so skeptical about the
fact that we might be visited?

00:05:49.837 --> 00:05:51.917 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is a vast
universe, they're

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:54.111 align:middle line:84%
finding planets all
over the place, things

00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:56.577 align:middle line:84%
that we when we
were kids predicted

00:05:56.577 --> 00:05:58.572 align:middle line:84%
without any science
at all, we knew

00:05:58.572 --> 00:06:00.899 align:middle line:84%
that there were planets
around other star

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:02.483 align:middle line:90%
systems in this universe.

00:06:02.483 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Why is science so baffled
to accept the possibility

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.897 align:middle line:84%
that there's life out
there and that they're

00:06:08.897 --> 00:06:10.158 align:middle line:90%
more advanced than us?

00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:13.710 align:middle line:84%
You give a civilization
a million years' head

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.931 align:middle line:84%
start in the same chronology
of knowledge growth,

00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:18.666 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
be way advanced.

00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:20.234 align:middle line:90%
So they came here.

00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:22.292 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah, the
problem is it's just

00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:84%
the same argument as people
that say if I don't see one,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't exist.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.742 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll tell you
I didn't see one

00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:30.658 align:middle line:84%
and that's not why I
started working this job,

00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:33.598 align:middle line:84%
you know, this, this
passion that I have,

00:06:33.598 --> 00:06:39.187 align:middle line:84%
science, how can science explain
something that comes here

00:06:39.187 --> 00:06:42.757 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't use our
form of propulsion?

00:06:42.757 --> 00:06:46.737 align:middle line:84%
How can science explain
something that doesn't

00:06:46.737 --> 00:06:48.429 align:middle line:90%
use petroleum, gas, oil?

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:84%
How can science explain
even if we want to go there,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.565 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if
we want to go there,

00:06:54.565 --> 00:06:56.773 align:middle line:84%
the contact scenario, you
know, the abduction contact

00:06:56.773 --> 00:06:59.321 align:middle line:84%
scenario, how can
science explain all that,

00:06:59.321 --> 00:07:03.978 align:middle line:84%
but we, we have something
growing called Quantum Theory.

00:07:03.978 --> 00:07:06.113 align:middle line:84%
You know, Quantum Theory,
there's a lot of people,

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:08.482 align:middle line:84%
there's Dean Radin, there's
a lot of people working

00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:13.821 align:middle line:84%
in this area and, and,
and Quantum Theory,

00:07:13.821 --> 00:07:17.237 align:middle line:84%
and even Michu Kaku's
work is, and he's

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:20.228 align:middle line:84%
very positive about
UFOs, as you know.

00:07:20.228 --> 00:07:24.398 align:middle line:84%
The possibility, I mean, there
are some avant garde scientists

00:07:24.398 --> 00:07:26.402 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
go there and I'm

00:07:26.402 --> 00:07:28.569 align:middle line:84%
hoping that our children
and our children's children

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:31.035 align:middle line:84%
will go there, because
if they don't we're

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:34.041 align:middle line:84%
stuck on this planet
and we can't go anywhere

00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:36.811 align:middle line:84%
and that would be totally
sad for the human race.

00:07:36.811 --> 00:07:38.946 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Years ago, Paola,
I had an opportunity

00:07:38.946 --> 00:07:41.322 align:middle line:84%
to interview the late
astronaut Gordon Cooper who

00:07:41.322 --> 00:07:44.676 align:middle line:84%
was one of the original
seven Mercury astronauts

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:48.672 align:middle line:84%
and he saw UFOs when he
was in one of his jets

00:07:48.672 --> 00:07:52.462 align:middle line:84%
and he took some film of it
and he said as soon as he

00:07:52.462 --> 00:07:55.162 align:middle line:84%
landed they confiscated the film
and he's never seen it again.

00:07:55.162 --> 00:07:56.764 align:middle line:90%
Now he has since died.

00:07:56.764 --> 00:08:00.268 align:middle line:84%
Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar
Mitchell walked on the moon,

00:08:00.268 --> 00:08:04.354 align:middle line:84%
he says, 'George, I've been told
by people in government that we

00:08:04.354 --> 00:08:07.208 align:middle line:84%
have been and are
being visited.'

00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:09.236 align:middle line:84%
Buzz Aldrin, the
only astronaut I've

00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:11.312 align:middle line:84%
interviewed who really
hasn't admitted anything.

00:08:11.312 --> 00:08:14.315 align:middle line:84%
He changes his mind
every once in a while.

00:08:14.315 --> 00:08:16.313 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
astronauts talking

00:08:16.313 --> 00:08:18.946 align:middle line:84%
about that, gentlemen
who are up in space,

00:08:18.946 --> 00:08:20.588 align:middle line:90%
what does that tell you?

00:08:20.588 --> 00:08:23.791 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Astronauts are seeing
things all over the world,

00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:27.295 align:middle line:84%
and you know, the ones we
mentioned Edgar Mitchell being

00:08:27.295 --> 00:08:30.475 align:middle line:84%
the most prominent, and he even
testified at the Washington

00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:33.394 align:middle line:84%
Press Club that we should
open up the Roswell file,

00:08:33.394 --> 00:08:35.202 align:middle line:84%
so we need to
admire these people.

00:08:35.202 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:84%
These people are
courageous because they're

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.211 align:middle line:84%
credible people, they're people
that have worked at NASA,

00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:43.778 align:middle line:84%
they're, you know, they're
people that risk their jobs.

00:08:43.778 --> 00:08:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: They don't have any
reason to lie, do they?

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.782 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: No, they don't,
and I think down deep,

00:08:47.782 --> 00:08:49.406 align:middle line:84%
if you've had a
sighting or if you've

00:08:49.406 --> 00:08:52.073 align:middle line:84%
heard that your colleagues
have had a sighting then

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:55.711 align:middle line:84%
I think that that you understand
the importance of discussing

00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:59.493 align:middle line:84%
this because we don't have to
go public as much I believe

00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:01.529 align:middle line:84%
that we should have an
intelligent discussion,

00:09:01.529 --> 00:09:02.863 align:middle line:90%
dialogue about it.

00:09:02.863 --> 00:09:05.053 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Absolutely,
the United Nations

00:09:05.053 --> 00:09:07.847 align:middle line:84%
has a representative
that they have brought

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:11.803 align:middle line:84%
that will be the first greeter
to any extraterrestrials that

00:09:11.803 --> 00:09:13.541 align:middle line:90%
might visit the planet.

00:09:13.541 --> 00:09:15.042 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that tell you?

00:09:15.042 --> 00:09:17.292 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Well, I don't know if
that was a publicity stunt

00:09:17.292 --> 00:09:19.844 align:middle line:84%
or if that was real, but that
did get down on the newspaper

00:09:19.844 --> 00:09:25.298 align:middle line:84%
some years ago and we all saw
it and I think that that would

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:29.191 align:middle line:84%
be one of the institutions,
the United Nations because it's

00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:30.899 align:middle line:84%
international where
we might open this up

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and George I don't
know if you know,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
but at the end of the
Citizen Hearing the six,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.541 align:middle line:84%
you know, political
representatives basically

00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:42.254 align:middle line:90%
said, 'We can't handle this.

00:09:42.254 --> 00:09:44.171 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it's not going
to go in the Congress.

00:09:44.171 --> 00:09:46.613 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we can
do is go to the United

00:09:46.613 --> 00:09:51.779 align:middle line:84%
Nations' and because Uruguay
was there and Paraguay,

00:09:51.779 --> 00:09:54.818 align:middle line:84%
they went to Latin America
to ask if one of the smaller

00:09:54.818 --> 00:09:57.184 align:middle line:84%
countries would be the one
to make the resolution.

00:09:57.184 --> 00:09:58.719 align:middle line:90%
You have to have a resolution.

00:09:58.719 --> 00:10:00.386 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Right some one's
got to endorse...

00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:02.907 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Some one's got to,
who has nothing to lose,

00:10:02.907 --> 00:10:04.855 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
major country that

00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:08.462 align:middle line:84%
is you know, hooked on to
the G8 is not going to do it.

00:10:08.462 --> 00:10:13.587 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we've got
a possibility that a South

00:10:13.587 --> 00:10:16.969 align:middle line:84%
American, you know, Latin
American country like Paraguay

00:10:16.969 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
will bring a resolution to the
United Nations for a dialogue,

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.277 align:middle line:84%
if nothing else,
just talk about it.

00:10:23.277 --> 00:10:24.645 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Right.

00:10:24.645 --> 00:10:26.213 align:middle line:84%
And the Citizens Hearing was
really a mock hearing though,

00:10:26.213 --> 00:10:27.296 align:middle line:90%
just so everybody knows...

00:10:27.296 --> 00:10:28.682 align:middle line:90%
>>PH: Yeah, it was a...

00:10:28.682 --> 00:10:31.409 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: It was done with former
congressional and senate

00:10:31.409 --> 00:10:34.008 align:middle line:84%
leaders so they were
there on the panel,

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:36.218 align:middle line:84%
real witnesses were
there, government people,

00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:41.028 align:middle line:84%
whistleblowers, and it was done
as if it were a real senate

00:10:41.028 --> 00:10:43.431 align:middle line:84%
confirmation or
investigative hearing

00:10:43.431 --> 00:10:46.668 align:middle line:84%
and it looked great Stephen
Bassett did an incredible job

00:10:46.668 --> 00:10:47.468 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:10:47.468 --> 00:10:49.716 align:middle line:84%
He and I differ,
though, I've always

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
told him governments aren't
going to fully disclose,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.943 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to come out
and say, we've been visited,

00:10:55.943 --> 00:11:00.147 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry we've lied to you over
all these years and this it is.

00:11:00.147 --> 00:11:02.424 align:middle line:84%
The only way we're going
to get the information

00:11:02.424 --> 00:11:05.488 align:middle line:84%
is from people like
you and whistleblowers

00:11:05.488 --> 00:11:08.781 align:middle line:84%
like Edgar Mitchell and
the late Gordon Cooper

00:11:08.781 --> 00:11:11.691 align:middle line:84%
who come forward and
say this is going on,

00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:15.447 align:middle line:84%
I was ordered to do this,
you know, fire on UFOs

00:11:15.447 --> 00:11:18.665 align:middle line:84%
with their rockets and stuff
like that, that's how we're

00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:19.867 align:middle line:90%
going to find out about it.

00:11:19.867 --> 00:11:21.302 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Well, you know, I
tend to agree with you.

00:11:21.302 --> 00:11:23.481 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any major
government's going to come

00:11:23.481 --> 00:11:24.364 align:middle line:90%
and say, guess what?

00:11:24.364 --> 00:11:25.739 align:middle line:84%
We've been lying
all these years.

00:11:25.739 --> 00:11:29.276 align:middle line:84%
However, let me tell you that
for me the Citizen Hearing,

00:11:29.276 --> 00:11:33.914 align:middle line:84%
and I, I talked to those former
counsel people and senators.

00:11:33.914 --> 00:11:35.382 align:middle line:90%
They were in shock.

00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:37.151 align:middle line:90%
There were 40 witnesses.

00:11:37.151 --> 00:11:41.188 align:middle line:84%
There were 39 men and one woman
that was Linda Moulton Howe

00:11:41.188 --> 00:11:44.258 align:middle line:84%
and I think those guys thought
they were going to be listening

00:11:44.258 --> 00:11:48.229 align:middle line:84%
to sightings and they got there
the first day and they sat down

00:11:48.229 --> 00:11:51.365 align:middle line:84%
and they were like really
okay, let's get this over with,

00:11:51.365 --> 00:11:54.119 align:middle line:84%
and one, the 40 witnesses
they were brought up

00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:58.072 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world, we
even had a general from Brazil,

00:11:58.072 --> 00:12:01.408 align:middle line:84%
were so credible, we had
Jesse Marcel and his children,

00:12:01.408 --> 00:12:04.945 align:middle line:84%
we had Nick Pope from, you
know, the from the ministry

00:12:04.945 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:90%
of Defense of England.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
The Randle [inaudible]
the Randle, Jim Penniston,

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.791 align:middle line:84%
and Burroughs, the
first day I watched

00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:17.057 align:middle line:84%
the faces of these people
and they were all white.

00:12:17.057 --> 00:12:19.079 align:middle line:84%
Their jaws dropped,
they thought they

00:12:19.079 --> 00:12:20.776 align:middle line:84%
were dealing with
sightings, but when

00:12:20.776 --> 00:12:23.997 align:middle line:84%
they saw the credibility of
the witnesses that were there,

00:12:23.997 --> 00:12:25.864 align:middle line:84%
they were exhausted
after five days,

00:12:25.864 --> 00:12:30.229 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know what to do,
and I talked to Mike Gravel

00:12:30.229 --> 00:12:34.575 align:middle line:84%
from Alaska and he felt a
real need to do something.

00:12:34.575 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:84%
He said he didn't know
it was this powerful.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.568 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Well, when you
get credible people,

00:12:38.568 --> 00:12:41.849 align:middle line:84%
and not to say that the
average person isn't credible,

00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:45.419 align:middle line:84%
but when you get professionals
who were in that field,

00:12:45.419 --> 00:12:47.792 align:middle line:84%
whether they are law
enforcement or military,

00:12:47.792 --> 00:12:50.624 align:middle line:84%
you've got to wake
up and I could

00:12:50.624 --> 00:12:52.459 align:middle line:84%
see these congressional
folks hearing

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:56.130 align:middle line:84%
this for probably the very
first time, thinking maybe these

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.699 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
actors or whatever

00:12:58.699 --> 00:13:01.461 align:middle line:84%
and then it just blew
their mind didn't it?

00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:03.003 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: It changed
their lives, I mean,

00:13:03.003 --> 00:13:05.105 align:middle line:84%
I was watching their
faces, they were white,

00:13:05.105 --> 00:13:07.308 align:middle line:84%
I mean they were just,
they were shaking

00:13:07.308 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:84%
when they had their
first coffee break,

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.032 align:middle line:84%
I felt so bad for
them because you

00:13:11.032 --> 00:13:13.724 align:middle line:84%
know we've been doing this for
a long time, we know it's real,

00:13:13.724 --> 00:13:15.382 align:middle line:84%
we know, we know
we've been trying

00:13:15.382 --> 00:13:17.587 align:middle line:84%
to get this information
up, but they

00:13:17.587 --> 00:13:19.653 align:middle line:84%
didn't know, they didn't
know how to handle it,

00:13:19.653 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:84%
they didn't know which way to go
so their questions were really

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.593 align:middle line:84%
good, you know, it was a ten
minutes of giving a statement

00:13:25.593 --> 00:13:29.897 align:middle line:84%
and then the panel gave
the questions each one,

00:13:29.897 --> 00:13:32.492 align:middle line:84%
the questions were amazing,
and if nothing else happened,

00:13:32.492 --> 00:13:33.292 align:middle line:90%
George,

00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:35.936 align:middle line:84%
though we had a major media
event so we've got to thank...

00:13:35.936 --> 00:13:37.503 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: [inaudible]
>>PH: You know,

00:13:37.503 --> 00:13:40.010 align:middle line:84%
we've got to thank Steve
Bassett and Steven Greer two

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.302 align:middle line:84%
quarterbacks this year,
I call them quarterbacks

00:13:42.302 --> 00:13:44.740 align:middle line:84%
because I'm using the metaphor
of a football team, okay,

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.918 align:middle line:84%
so because this has to be a
team for doing it and it was

00:13:49.918 --> 00:13:50.718 align:middle line:90%
powerful.

00:13:50.718 --> 00:13:54.321 align:middle line:84%
Probably, it was so riveting
I didn't move off my chair,

00:13:54.321 --> 00:13:57.224 align:middle line:84%
not even to go to the restroom,
I didn't want to miss a minute.

00:13:57.224 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
No, I mean it was like, I
thought it would never happen,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.296 align:middle line:90%
now it was mock, you're right.

00:14:02.296 --> 00:14:04.766 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: It was mock, but
it was based on reality.

00:14:04.766 --> 00:14:05.766 align:middle line:90%
>>PH: It was mock, yeah.

00:14:05.766 --> 00:14:06.934 align:middle line:84%

the important thing.

00:14:06.934 --> 00:14:08.434 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some
questions for Paola,

00:14:08.434 --> 00:14:09.837 align:middle line:84%
from you, so just
raise your hand

00:14:09.837 --> 00:14:13.273 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get right
to you, right here.

00:14:13.273 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there some place that you
can get the, the testimony from

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:18.712 align:middle line:90%
that hearing?

00:14:18.712 --> 00:14:21.842 align:middle line:84%
Have access to the information
that was presented there.

00:14:21.842 --> 00:14:23.217 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah, it's
on the internet,

00:14:23.217 --> 00:14:27.414 align:middle line:84%
you can go to the website for
the Citizen Hearing, a Paradigm

00:14:27.414 --> 00:14:30.057 align:middle line:84%
Research Group, so go to
paradigm research group.

00:14:30.057 --> 00:14:34.128 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Or Google Citizens Hearing
for UFOs, you'll find that...

00:14:34.128 --> 00:14:35.563 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Right, and
you can, you can

00:14:35.563 --> 00:14:37.582 align:middle line:84%
get some of the testimony,
some of the most powerful,

00:14:37.582 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and remember it's not all
American because there were

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.625 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people from South
America, Peru, Brazil, A. J.

00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:48.231 align:middle line:84%
Gevaerd came from Brazil with a
general talking about the fact

00:14:48.231 --> 00:14:51.644 align:middle line:84%
that the military are giving the
ufologists the material, which

00:14:51.644 --> 00:14:53.159 align:middle line:90%
never would happen here.

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:54.867 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Well, there are
some countries that

00:14:54.867 --> 00:14:59.139 align:middle line:84%
seem to be more lax in
hiding UFO information,

00:14:59.139 --> 00:15:00.654 align:middle line:90%
would you agree?

00:15:00.654 --> 00:15:02.723 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah, Brazil
is one of them.

00:15:02.723 --> 00:15:04.291 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: How about, sure...

00:15:04.291 --> 00:15:10.099 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have a theory as to
why governments world wide are

00:15:10.099 --> 00:15:13.333 align:middle line:84%
withholding this
information from the public?

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:15.741 align:middle line:84%
It's not just our
government but it

00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:18.599 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a phenomenon
around the world,

00:15:18.599 --> 00:15:20.974 align:middle line:84%
especially with people
testifying as you described

00:15:20.974 --> 00:15:21.842 align:middle line:90%
from other places.

00:15:21.842 --> 00:15:25.045 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: That's the
$64,000 question Paola -

00:15:25.045 --> 00:15:26.708 align:middle line:90%
why aren't they telling us?

00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:28.916 align:middle line:84%
I have my own thoughts I'll
mention that in a second.

00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:31.715 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah, you asked
us for our own theory

00:15:31.715 --> 00:15:35.318 align:middle line:84%
on this, okay, first of
all, other governments

00:15:35.318 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:84%
like Canada, France who did the
COMETA Report, Great Britain,

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.446 align:middle line:84%
Ireland, and several
South American countries

00:15:42.446 --> 00:15:45.129 align:middle line:84%
have released their UFO
files, at least they

00:15:45.129 --> 00:15:47.642 align:middle line:84%
say there are
UFOs, okay, so it's

00:15:47.642 --> 00:15:51.438 align:middle line:84%
America that is really
holding back and the reason,

00:15:51.438 --> 00:15:56.443 align:middle line:84%
this is my theory, okay, because
I've done so much research in,

00:15:56.443 --> 00:15:59.610 align:middle line:84%
in the back engineering
end of this situation

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.777 align:middle line:84%
and I was the journalist
that brought Colonel Philip

00:16:01.777 --> 00:16:04.284 align:middle line:84%
Corso to Europe and I talked
to Colonel Philip Corso.

00:16:04.284 --> 00:16:07.721 align:middle line:84%
He was in research and
development at the Pentagon

00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:10.891 align:middle line:84%
and was in charge of
the Roswell crash pieces

00:16:10.891 --> 00:16:14.641 align:middle line:84%
to back engineer them in
the 1960's, wrote the book

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The Day After
Roswell, if you want

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.095 align:middle line:84%
to do some research because of
his testimony or his speaking

00:16:21.095 --> 00:16:24.438 align:middle line:84%
about this I realized
that when we have crashes

00:16:24.438 --> 00:16:27.207 align:middle line:84%
we do not throw the
craft in the trash

00:16:27.207 --> 00:16:30.043 align:middle line:84%
and that they do not
travel with gas and oil.

00:16:30.043 --> 00:16:33.836 align:middle line:84%
So what we have here is an
alternative, alternative energy

00:16:33.836 --> 00:16:38.371 align:middle line:84%
system, which would bring
down the whole entire economic

00:16:38.371 --> 00:16:40.938 align:middle line:84%
foundation of the
planet and this

00:16:40.938 --> 00:16:42.756 align:middle line:84%
is what the movie
Sirius is about,

00:16:42.756 --> 00:16:46.352 align:middle line:84%
Steven Greer's film,
the energy systems that

00:16:46.352 --> 00:16:49.229 align:middle line:84%
are being held back, and
I think unfortunately,

00:16:49.229 --> 00:16:52.198 align:middle line:84%
the United States has a vested
interest in not talking about

00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:54.178 align:middle line:90%
them yet, maybe in the future.

00:16:54.178 --> 00:16:56.136 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: I think that plays
a huge part, you know,

00:16:56.136 --> 00:16:57.809 align:middle line:84%
because we want
free energy and they

00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:84%
don't want to give it to us,
I think the other thing too

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.959 align:middle line:84%
Paola is they really think
they're going to lose control

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:07.213 align:middle line:84%
because if people really
believe that we have brothers

00:17:07.213 --> 00:17:10.693 align:middle line:84%
and sisters out there on
other planets, what does it do

00:17:10.693 --> 00:17:14.688 align:middle line:84%
to religion, what does it do to
control the people because all

00:17:14.688 --> 00:17:19.026 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden we are a federation,
a galactic federation,

00:17:19.026 --> 00:17:21.728 align:middle line:84%
we're not just, you
know, earthlings any more

00:17:21.728 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:84%
and I think people's perceptions
of how they will treat life

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.402 align:middle line:84%
will change dramatically, and
I think Governments think,

00:17:28.402 --> 00:17:31.872 align:middle line:84%
we can't control people
once they feel that way.

00:17:31.872 --> 00:17:32.672 align:middle line:90%
Do they?

00:17:32.672 --> 00:17:34.214 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah so,
absolutely, and I love

00:17:34.214 --> 00:17:36.807 align:middle line:84%
the way you worded that
because that is really true

00:17:36.807 --> 00:17:39.813 align:middle line:84%
and they would lose control,
they don't have it any way,

00:17:39.813 --> 00:17:42.616 align:middle line:84%
but they would
definitely lose control,

00:17:42.616 --> 00:17:44.389 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
how you feel, but I

00:17:44.389 --> 00:17:47.609 align:middle line:84%
want to be part of a galactic
federation of neighbors

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:50.691 align:middle line:84%
from other places because
we're stuck on this planet.

00:17:50.691 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Well, you know, the movie
Contact, one of my favorites,

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
where the alien came down
and was talking to Ellie,

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.115 align:middle line:84%
you know, Jodie Foster
played that part,

00:17:58.115 --> 00:18:00.122 align:middle line:84%
and they talked
about they're all

00:18:00.122 --> 00:18:03.873 align:middle line:84%
searching for life out in the
universe because it's lonely

00:18:03.873 --> 00:18:09.304 align:middle line:84%
and I mean in a very strange
sense, when I was a little boy

00:18:09.304 --> 00:18:12.993 align:middle line:84%
and I would look at the
stars, I kept saying to myself

00:18:12.993 --> 00:18:18.952 align:middle line:84%
how sad would it be if all
this was just for us alone.

00:18:18.952 --> 00:18:22.723 align:middle line:84%
And there's more to that so
I started at a very young age

00:18:22.723 --> 00:18:26.293 align:middle line:84%
to conclude, No there's
got to be other planets

00:18:26.293 --> 00:18:30.297 align:middle line:84%
and I think the life forms are
probably the same every where,

00:18:30.297 --> 00:18:33.657 align:middle line:84%
we may look very similar
on other planets as well

00:18:33.657 --> 00:18:36.392 align:middle line:84%
and based on some of the
testimony of witnesses

00:18:36.392 --> 00:18:39.741 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot out there
that do look like us

00:18:39.741 --> 00:18:42.014 align:middle line:84%
or maybe we look
like them, you know,

00:18:42.014 --> 00:18:44.329 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get into that
whether we were seeded or not,

00:18:44.329 --> 00:18:46.079 align:middle line:84%
but let's take another
question for Paola.

00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:47.247 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir.

00:18:47.247 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a truck driver, I had a
sighting about three years ago

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.451 align:middle line:90%
over New York City.

00:18:51.451 --> 00:18:53.603 align:middle line:84%
I was coming down the
New Jersey Turnpike

00:18:53.603 --> 00:18:55.876 align:middle line:84%
and I saw this orb
like this, there

00:18:55.876 --> 00:18:59.526 align:middle line:84%
was white color, the round balls
up there what are these things?

00:18:59.526 --> 00:19:00.427 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Orbs.

00:19:00.427 --> 00:19:01.954 align:middle line:90%
Paola, lots of people see orbs.

00:19:01.954 --> 00:19:03.496 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Well, one of
my books is called

00:19:03.496 --> 00:19:05.627 align:middle line:84%
How do You Speak
to a Ball of Light,

00:19:05.627 --> 00:19:10.255 align:middle line:84%
I've written four books on
this and actually the orbs

00:19:10.255 --> 00:19:14.441 align:middle line:84%
are, are a manifestation
of something.

00:19:14.441 --> 00:19:17.044 align:middle line:84%
If an orb shows
up on your camera,

00:19:17.044 --> 00:19:20.714 align:middle line:84%
it could be the manifestation
of some kind of energy.

00:19:20.714 --> 00:19:23.135 align:middle line:84%
if an orb shows
up in the sky, it

00:19:23.135 --> 00:19:26.317 align:middle line:84%
could be a manifestation
of a light around a craft

00:19:26.317 --> 00:19:30.072 align:middle line:84%
and that's the way it
appears because a lot of the,

00:19:30.072 --> 00:19:33.537 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the Mexican
case, the Campeche case were

00:19:33.537 --> 00:19:38.753 align:middle line:84%
nine orbs or seven orbs and,
and that's the way they appear,

00:19:38.753 --> 00:19:41.776 align:middle line:84%
but then when they
may, you know,

00:19:41.776 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
then transform themselves
into metal craft, it's just,

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.275 align:middle line:90%
it was not ours, was it?

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:49.643 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that was ours?

00:19:49.643 --> 00:19:53.741 align:middle line:84%
>> What I saw was this big
orange glowing light about

00:19:53.741 --> 00:19:58.819 align:middle line:84%
the size of four blips
floating up on New York City.

00:19:58.819 --> 00:20:00.803 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple
of days later I

00:20:00.803 --> 00:20:02.603 align:middle line:84%
heard on Coast to
Coast other people've

00:20:02.603 --> 00:20:03.657 align:middle line:90%
had the same sighting.

00:20:03.657 --> 00:20:04.458 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Right.

00:20:04.458 --> 00:20:05.225 align:middle line:90%
>>PH: Well that's...

00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:06.267 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Very strange Paola.

00:20:06.267 --> 00:20:09.908 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: That's what Robert
Salas reports with the missile

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:12.716 align:middle line:84%
shutdown at Malmstrom Air
Force Base in the 1960's

00:20:12.716 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:84%
that there was this
big orange light that

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.573 align:middle line:84%
was over Malmstrom where he
was underground, you know,

00:20:19.573 --> 00:20:23.333 align:middle line:84%
attending to these 10
missiles and, you know,

00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:26.515 align:middle line:84%
slowly that one by
one they all shut down

00:20:26.515 --> 00:20:29.114 align:middle line:84%
and of course, the military
that were above ground

00:20:29.114 --> 00:20:32.085 align:middle line:84%
were freaked out totally
wanted to come underground

00:20:32.085 --> 00:20:35.355 align:middle line:90%
because of this big orange orb.

00:20:35.355 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think
that's a manifestation

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.559 align:middle line:90%
of the way they appear.

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:40.846 align:middle line:90%
You saw a UFO.

00:20:40.846 --> 00:20:43.096 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Let's take another
question for Paola, one more,

00:20:43.096 --> 00:20:44.831 align:middle line:90%
yes sir, way in the back.

00:20:44.831 --> 00:20:49.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi Paola, there, there must
be so many people involved

00:20:49.903 --> 00:20:53.731 align:middle line:84%
in the cover up more each
year when Gordon Cooper gives

00:20:53.731 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
the tape to someone they have
to receive it and look at it

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.538 align:middle line:84%
and the group has to decide what
it is and then there are people

00:21:00.538 --> 00:21:03.176 align:middle line:84%
he asks what happened to the
tape they have to cover it up

00:21:03.176 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
so there must be more and more
people aware of hard evidence

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.721 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:09.523 align:middle line:90%
What keeps them all quiet?

00:21:09.523 --> 00:21:10.357 align:middle line:90%
>>PH: I, I...

00:21:10.357 --> 00:21:11.725 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Well, they're petrified.

00:21:11.725 --> 00:21:14.267 align:middle line:84%

Edward Snowdens, the fellow who

not a lot of people

do that, there're a
lot of people out there

00:21:36.357 --> 00:21:39.158 align:middle line:84%
I mean you take on a
major risk and people

00:21:39.158 --> 00:21:41.828 align:middle line:84%
have been threatened, you
know, that and families,

00:21:41.828 --> 00:21:46.146 align:middle line:84%
even if you decide you're going

you've got a family.

are the whistleblowers

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:84%
George calls the
whistleblowers, those people

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.719 align:middle line:84%
are heroes because
they took the risk

00:21:58.719 --> 00:22:02.949 align:middle line:84%
and they took the risk to tell
the universe to tell everybody

00:22:02.949 --> 00:22:04.899 align:middle line:84%
in the world that
we're not alone

00:22:04.899 --> 00:22:06.679 align:middle line:84%

just for us, it's

00:22:06.679 --> 00:22:08.682 align:middle line:84%
for your children

>>GN: And most of them took
the risk after they retired.

00:22:16.757 --> 00:22:19.326 align:middle line:84%
They were smart enough to
keep their jobs for a while

00:22:19.326 --> 00:22:21.709 align:middle line:84%
and then they retired,
I wonder if that's

00:22:21.709 --> 00:22:24.097 align:middle line:84%
affected their pensions
or anything like that.

00:22:24.097 --> 00:22:26.266 align:middle line:90%
I would think it could.

didn't Governor Symington

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:33.714 align:middle line:84%
wait until after he
retired to say he really

00:22:33.714 --> 00:22:35.008 align:middle line:90%
saw the Phoenix Light?

00:22:35.008 --> 00:22:35.808 align:middle line:90%

craft over Phoenix

what did he do?

>>GN: He thought it was a joke.

00:22:40.037 --> 00:22:43.542 align:middle line:84%

he was the Governor of Arizona

00:22:43.542 --> 00:22:47.787 align:middle line:84%
Fife Symington and they had
the Phoenix Lights in 1997

00:22:47.787 --> 00:22:52.327 align:middle line:84%
where every body saw this huge
object, he at a news conference

00:22:52.327 --> 00:22:56.211 align:middle line:84%
had a guy dress up like an
alien and they laughed about it

00:22:56.211 --> 00:22:58.383 align:middle line:84%
and everything else,
years later, he

00:22:58.383 --> 00:23:01.902 align:middle line:84%
apologized on the Larry King
Show, I was on that show,

00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:05.839 align:middle line:84%
he said, I'm convinced this was
real, what people saw was real,

00:23:05.839 --> 00:23:08.853 align:middle line:84%
I made a mistake, I should
never have done that again,

00:23:08.853 --> 00:23:11.945 align:middle line:84%
and now, he's a
proponent of UFOs.

00:23:11.945 --> 00:23:14.648 align:middle line:84%

make that turnaround.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek,
whom you knew,

00:23:17.168 --> 00:23:19.475 align:middle line:84%
was a skeptic in
the beginning when

00:23:19.475 --> 00:23:21.621 align:middle line:84%
he was a consultant
for Project Bluebook.

him for a long time,

but later on in his career
he recanted all this

00:23:29.896 --> 00:23:32.306 align:middle line:84%
and was a believer, went
on to write the book

00:23:32.306 --> 00:23:34.779 align:middle line:84%
Close Encounters of the
Third Kind, which Steven

00:23:34.779 --> 00:23:36.436 align:middle line:90%
Spielberg turned into a movie.

00:23:36.436 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah, and a
lot of people feel

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.406 align:middle line:84%
the responsibility
when they retire,

00:23:40.406 --> 00:23:41.541 align:middle line:90%
especially military people.

00:23:41.541 --> 00:23:44.362 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the people
at the Citizen Hearing

00:23:44.362 --> 00:23:47.875 align:middle line:84%
were retired military, and
one particular gentleman

00:23:47.875 --> 00:23:52.252 align:middle line:84%
talked about firing 46 rounds
of ammunition at a UFO.

00:23:52.252 --> 00:23:55.465 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time
he had ever spoken,

00:23:55.465 --> 00:23:57.299 align:middle line:84%
Colonel French and he
said he could never

00:23:57.299 --> 00:24:00.325 align:middle line:84%
tell his wife about it, but
he took an oath in front

00:24:00.325 --> 00:24:03.016 align:middle line:84%
of the mock hearing
and, and it was amazing

00:24:03.016 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:84%
because he for the first
time said, I fired 46 rounds

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.166 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't even
touch the thing.

00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:10.208 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: I'll always remember
a story I had on Coast

00:24:10.208 --> 00:24:12.672 align:middle line:84%
to Coast when a woman called
me one night and said,

00:24:12.672 --> 00:24:16.843 align:middle line:84%
my husband is never
late coming home ever,

00:24:16.843 --> 00:24:21.848 align:middle line:84%
but he came home tonight and
he was nervous and sweaty

00:24:21.848 --> 00:24:24.344 align:middle line:84%
and told me he was
abducted by aliens,

00:24:24.344 --> 00:24:27.053 align:middle line:84%
and I went, Oh
really, what happened?

00:24:27.053 --> 00:24:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and those
aliens you know what else they

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.392 align:middle line:84%
did to him, and I'm going, Oh
my God, what did they do to him,

00:24:32.392 --> 00:24:36.329 align:middle line:84%
you know, and she said, they
took his wedding ring off.

00:24:36.329 --> 00:24:38.031 align:middle line:90%
And I went oh God...

00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:39.432 align:middle line:90%
>>PH: Oh...

00:24:39.432 --> 00:24:42.736 align:middle line:84%

What keeps you
fighting this fight?

00:24:52.145 --> 00:24:55.216 align:middle line:84%
Because you are obsessed
with this and you don't stop,

00:24:55.216 --> 00:24:56.016 align:middle line:90%
how come?

00:24:56.016 --> 00:24:58.551 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: I know a lot of it
is from my own pocket too,

00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:01.688 align:middle line:84%
because there's no, there's
no sponsor for this stuff.

00:25:01.688 --> 00:25:04.491 align:middle line:84%
I'm really, I'm a teacher
and I've taught high school,

00:25:04.491 --> 00:25:09.301 align:middle line:84%
I've taught here, I've taught
in Rome at the American Overseas

00:25:09.301 --> 00:25:12.836 align:middle line:84%
School, I've taught in Boulder,
Colorado and I think that

00:25:12.836 --> 00:25:16.734 align:middle line:84%
basically I'm obsessed with
education and it being done

00:25:16.734 --> 00:25:19.439 align:middle line:84%
the right way
academically and I,

00:25:19.439 --> 00:25:22.676 align:middle line:84%
something inside me really
was moved, as you know,

00:25:22.676 --> 00:25:25.928 align:middle line:84%
when I saw Close Encounters
at the very end when there was

00:25:25.928 --> 00:25:27.247 align:middle line:90%
that exchange with...

that people have asked,

00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:38.091 align:middle line:84%

00:25:38.091 --> 00:25:40.229 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: I would if I would,
if I could come back,

00:25:40.229 --> 00:25:42.354 align:middle line:84%
you know, and not too long,
I mean I don't want to,

00:25:42.354 --> 00:25:45.953 align:middle line:84%
I don't want my kids to be 95
when I come back, you know.

00:25:45.953 --> 00:25:47.745 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Okay, under those
conditions, I'd go,

00:25:47.745 --> 00:25:48.501 align:middle line:90%
yeah, we should go.

00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:49.869 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: You know, we'd go,
I'd go for a few months.

00:25:49.869 --> 00:25:51.327 align:middle line:84%

put that out there?

00:25:51.327 --> 00:25:52.205 align:middle line:90%
>>GM: You know what?

00:25:52.205 --> 00:25:54.038 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah, let's, let's
put that out there,

00:25:54.038 --> 00:25:56.876 align:middle line:84%
maybe we could go
and, and come back.

00:25:56.876 --> 00:26:00.176 align:middle line:84%
But I really think there was
something inside of me that

00:26:00.176 --> 00:26:02.849 align:middle line:84%
propelled me to meet
Allen Hynek, whom I worked

00:26:02.849 --> 00:26:04.501 align:middle line:84%
with for six years,
and you know,

00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:06.452 align:middle line:84%
George when I worked
with him it wasn't like

00:26:06.452 --> 00:26:08.329 align:middle line:84%
do you believe in UFOs,
he was a scientist,

00:26:08.329 --> 00:26:10.246 align:middle line:84%
he was an astronomer,
he wasn't playing around

00:26:10.246 --> 00:26:11.791 align:middle line:90%
so I knew it was real.

00:26:11.791 --> 00:26:13.827 align:middle line:84%
So then, you know,
when I was in Italy,

00:26:13.827 --> 00:26:16.896 align:middle line:84%
I realized that maybe I could
be of service to the planet

00:26:16.896 --> 00:26:18.698 align:middle line:84%
and that's basically
what I'm doing,

00:26:18.698 --> 00:26:20.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm just giving information.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.204 align:middle line:84%
Even in my books I don't put
a lot of my opinion in there.

00:26:24.204 --> 00:26:27.340 align:middle line:84%
People ask for my opinion,
I say this is my opinion,

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.377 align:middle line:84%
it is not the truth,
this is not religion.

00:26:30.377 --> 00:26:32.545 align:middle line:84%
This is what I've done all
my books are interviews

00:26:32.545 --> 00:26:34.597 align:middle line:84%
with whistleblowers,
military pilots,

00:26:34.597 --> 00:26:37.948 align:middle line:84%
I really feel sorry
for the pilots

00:26:37.948 --> 00:26:40.546 align:middle line:84%
because they're never
briefed about this

00:26:40.546 --> 00:26:42.674 align:middle line:84%
and, and neither, I
don't know if astronauts

00:26:42.674 --> 00:26:44.057 align:middle line:90%
are briefed either about this.

00:26:44.057 --> 00:26:45.059 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: I bet they are.

00:26:45.059 --> 00:26:45.859 align:middle line:90%

Yeah, if you see something,

00:26:47.545 --> 00:26:47.827 align:middle line:90%

>>GN: Paola you were very
close with the Late Monsignor

00:26:50.628 --> 00:26:52.232 align:middle line:90%
Balducci from the Vatican.

00:26:52.232 --> 00:26:55.187 align:middle line:84%
What was his role there
and what did he tell you?

00:26:55.187 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Well, he lived up
the street from me in Rome

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.182 align:middle line:84%
so it was easier to
have dinner together

00:26:59.182 --> 00:27:03.092 align:middle line:84%
and he basically said that he
was, the Pope said it was okay

00:27:03.092 --> 00:27:07.864 align:middle line:84%
or the Pope allowed him
to say that it is not

00:27:07.864 --> 00:27:11.708 align:middle line:84%
against the Catholic
religion to believe in UFOs

00:27:11.708 --> 00:27:15.722 align:middle line:84%
and he also said that in, in
the evolutionary scale looking

00:27:15.722 --> 00:27:18.725 align:middle line:84%
at humanity what it's doing
to itself with the crime

00:27:18.725 --> 00:27:21.385 align:middle line:84%
and everything else,
so humanity is probably

00:27:21.385 --> 00:27:23.779 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom of the
ladder of evolution,

00:27:23.779 --> 00:27:26.199 align:middle line:84%
so whatever is out there
is much more evolved

00:27:26.199 --> 00:27:29.038 align:middle line:84%
and he said they were our
brothers and sisters, which

00:27:29.038 --> 00:27:32.365 align:middle line:84%
you know I'm wondering what,
where is he coming, you know,

00:27:32.365 --> 00:27:34.856 align:middle line:84%
where is he coming from
or what does the Vatican

00:27:34.856 --> 00:27:35.718 align:middle line:90%
know about this?

00:27:35.718 --> 00:27:37.343 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: And what do
they know about this?

00:27:37.343 --> 00:27:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean they have two
observatories, right,

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.748 align:middle line:90%
looking into the heavens.

00:27:41.748 --> 00:27:45.452 align:middle line:84%
Why would the Vatican,
why would the church

00:27:45.452 --> 00:27:47.821 align:middle line:84%
want telescopes
and observatories?

00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:50.923 align:middle line:84%

out there is coming our way,

00:27:54.285 --> 00:27:57.030 align:middle line:84%

something is coming our way,

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%
they want to position themselves
as every major institution

be ready, maybe NASA will even,

00:28:03.436 --> 00:28:05.180 align:middle line:84%

it slowly, you know,

Mars, there is a microbe there,

00:28:18.818 --> 00:28:23.638 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing is
what's called a slow process

00:28:23.638 --> 00:28:26.786 align:middle line:84%
release of information
and I, you know,

00:28:26.786 --> 00:28:28.161 align:middle line:84%
you asked me what
keeps me going,

00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:31.191 align:middle line:84%
I want it to be done
properly, I don't want,

00:28:31.191 --> 00:28:34.576 align:middle line:84%
you know, a lot of stuff on
internet is not real and it, it

00:28:34.576 --> 00:28:37.371 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's a lot of rumors
and a lot of fear mongering

00:28:37.371 --> 00:28:38.171 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:28:38.171 --> 00:28:40.573 align:middle line:84%
I'd like it to be done
on an academic scale.

00:28:40.573 --> 00:28:41.899 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: I do too.

00:28:41.899 --> 00:28:43.399 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah and, and
I think you help

00:28:43.399 --> 00:28:46.145 align:middle line:84%
a lot George I really thank
you for everything you do.

00:28:46.145 --> 00:28:48.399 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: No, you know,
it, it's something

00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:51.885 align:middle line:84%
that I since I was a
little boy have believed in

00:28:51.885 --> 00:28:53.553 align:middle line:90%
and I just want answers.

00:28:53.553 --> 00:28:56.923 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm doing this
to get answers so I,

00:28:56.923 --> 00:29:01.728 align:middle line:84%
so like you will be able to tell
my kids and my grandchildren,

00:29:01.728 --> 00:29:05.468 align:middle line:84%
you know what, we are not
alone in the universe,

00:29:05.468 --> 00:29:06.599 align:middle line:90%
simple as that.

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:08.368 align:middle line:84%
And that's my quest
and I'm not stopping

00:29:08.368 --> 00:29:09.636 align:middle line:90%
and neither are you obviously.

00:29:09.636 --> 00:29:10.436 align:middle line:90%
>>PH: No.

00:29:10.436 --> 00:29:12.839 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's something
inside it's something,

00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:16.414 align:middle line:84%
it's certainly not the any
kind of money or any kind

00:29:16.414 --> 00:29:18.912 align:middle line:84%
of, it's, it's very difficult
for a women in this field...

00:29:18.912 --> 00:29:20.113 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: It is huge.

00:29:20.113 --> 00:29:22.348 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Because, you know,
it's, it's very difficult,

00:29:22.348 --> 00:29:24.814 align:middle line:84%
but you know I'm
just doing the best I

00:29:24.814 --> 00:29:28.648 align:middle line:84%
can like a lot of my colleagues
and, and we just do what

00:29:28.648 --> 00:29:30.764 align:middle line:90%
we can do and get it out there.

00:29:30.764 --> 00:29:32.222 align:middle line:84%
For the people that
are interested,

00:29:32.222 --> 00:29:33.930 align:middle line:84%
the other people that
are not interested,

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.772 align:middle line:84%
I mean I get questions, how
do I convince my friend?

00:29:36.772 --> 00:29:38.064 align:middle line:90%
You don't convince your friend.

00:29:38.064 --> 00:29:40.433 align:middle line:84%
If your friends aren't
interested let them go.

00:29:40.433 --> 00:29:43.736 align:middle line:84%
If you're interested, then it is
something you should research.

00:29:43.736 --> 00:29:46.739 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Zecharia Sitchin,
God rest his soul,

00:29:46.739 --> 00:29:50.681 align:middle line:84%
concluded in his research
that extraterrestrials

00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:56.482 align:middle line:84%
came to this planet a long
time ago, 400,000 years ago

00:29:56.482 --> 00:29:59.023 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted gold,
they needed gold

00:29:59.023 --> 00:30:02.434 align:middle line:84%
to sprinkle into their
atmosphere to contain things,

00:30:02.434 --> 00:30:06.323 align:middle line:84%
but they got tired of doing
the work themselves so they

00:30:06.323 --> 00:30:09.139 align:middle line:84%
decided, 'Hey look at
these creatures that

00:30:09.139 --> 00:30:10.863 align:middle line:90%
are running around this planet.

00:30:10.863 --> 00:30:15.695 align:middle line:84%
Let's play with them a little
bit genetically and turn them

00:30:15.695 --> 00:30:17.003 align:middle line:90%
into workers.'

00:30:17.003 --> 00:30:19.038 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that's
how it all started?

00:30:19.038 --> 00:30:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Well I interviewed
Zecharia Sitchin

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.677 align:middle line:84%
and he was a very, very
good scholar, as you know.

00:30:24.677 --> 00:30:25.504 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Yes.

00:30:25.504 --> 00:30:27.046 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: So he did his
homework, I mean,

00:30:27.046 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:84%
he went all over
the world looking

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.788 align:middle line:84%
for proof of this in sculptures,
in petroglyphs and all kinds

00:30:32.788 --> 00:30:35.964 align:middle line:84%
of things, yeah, I mean why
not, that's a possibility,

00:30:35.964 --> 00:30:39.284 align:middle line:84%
I think, but I don't think it
was just the an anarchy that

00:30:39.284 --> 00:30:42.161 align:middle line:84%
could have ceded us,
I think just knowing

00:30:42.161 --> 00:30:43.813 align:middle line:84%
that there are
different races, I

00:30:43.813 --> 00:30:46.313 align:middle line:84%
mean if you really do research
there are different races

00:30:46.313 --> 00:30:48.731 align:middle line:84%
that, that are
visiting this planet,

00:30:48.731 --> 00:30:53.001 align:middle line:84%
I think that maybe they left
some, some people behind

00:30:53.001 --> 00:30:54.641 align:middle line:90%
and it's a possibility.

00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Look at the diversity
of this planet.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.711 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Absolutely.

00:30:58.711 --> 00:31:01.247 align:middle line:84%
I mean we have so many
ethnicities on this planet

00:31:01.247 --> 00:31:03.916 align:middle line:84%
and you look at that and
you go how can this be?

00:31:03.916 --> 00:31:08.948 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the way I think
that every ethnic race that we

00:31:08.948 --> 00:31:12.525 align:middle line:84%
have on this planet is a
separate extraterrestrial race

00:31:12.525 --> 00:31:16.996 align:middle line:84%
that has come here and
altered whatever we had,

00:31:16.996 --> 00:31:18.767 align:middle line:90%
maybe that missing link.

00:31:18.767 --> 00:31:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah, if you want
to add another thing

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.647 align:middle line:84%
and you really want to
study this because I,

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:23.569 align:middle line:90%
I love academics.

00:31:23.569 --> 00:31:25.487 align:middle line:84%
What about the
Bible when they say

00:31:25.487 --> 00:31:30.209 align:middle line:84%
that people lived to be 115
and 120 and 110 and so on?

00:31:30.209 --> 00:31:31.044 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Or Methuselah.

00:31:31.044 --> 00:31:32.145 align:middle line:90%
How old was he?

00:31:32.145 --> 00:31:33.980 align:middle line:84%
800 years old,
something like that?

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.082 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Maybe that
was not a human.

00:31:36.082 --> 00:31:39.052 align:middle line:84%
I mean you, you don't
know, it's really difficult

00:31:39.052 --> 00:31:41.487 align:middle line:84%
because I think our history
needs to be rewritten,

00:31:41.487 --> 00:31:44.457 align:middle line:84%
our history has been
told to us and there

00:31:44.457 --> 00:31:47.077 align:middle line:84%
are several, thank God,
there are several shows that

00:31:47.077 --> 00:31:49.362 align:middle line:84%
talk about ancient
aliens because I think

00:31:49.362 --> 00:31:53.690 align:middle line:84%
that the whole UFO question,
the whole alien question

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:55.935 align:middle line:90%
is also a historical question.

00:31:55.935 --> 00:31:59.046 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: You just said something
that was very interesting,

00:31:59.046 --> 00:32:00.039 align:middle line:90%
thank God.

00:32:00.039 --> 00:32:01.808 align:middle line:90%
Is there a God?

00:32:01.808 --> 00:32:04.977 align:middle line:84%
If extraterrestrials
subseeded us,

00:32:04.977 --> 00:32:07.714 align:middle line:84%
if Genesis confused
fallen angels

00:32:07.714 --> 00:32:12.127 align:middle line:84%
for fallen extraterrestrials,
is there a God?

00:32:12.127 --> 00:32:13.419 align:middle line:90%
>>PH: Well, I think absolutely.

00:32:13.419 --> 00:32:16.869 align:middle line:84%
I mean absolutely, I, I wouldn't
see what the, what the problem

00:32:16.869 --> 00:32:20.253 align:middle line:84%
is and I'm Italian, so all the
renaissance paintings have god

00:32:20.253 --> 00:32:22.829 align:middle line:84%
be, you know, the
white haired person...

00:32:22.829 --> 00:32:24.197 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: In a cloud.

00:32:24.197 --> 00:32:26.933 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: In a cloud, you know,
like Michelangelo's, you know,

00:32:26.933 --> 00:32:30.336 align:middle line:84%
Sistine Chapel and he's
created Adam, so forth.

00:32:30.336 --> 00:32:32.634 align:middle line:84%
What if Adam was
genetically created

00:32:32.634 --> 00:32:37.006 align:middle line:84%
and what if we are dealing
with a force, a very

00:32:37.006 --> 00:32:39.700 align:middle line:84%
intelligent force that
has made the universe

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.742 align:middle line:84%
and I think mathematics
and quantum physics approve

00:32:42.742 --> 00:32:45.418 align:middle line:84%
that there is order
in the universe,

00:32:45.418 --> 00:32:48.354 align:middle line:84%
and if there is order,
then something did

00:32:48.354 --> 00:32:53.315 align:middle line:84%
it is just that it's beyond
our capacity to, we call it,

00:32:53.315 --> 00:32:54.861 align:middle line:90%
we call him or it.

00:32:54.861 --> 00:32:57.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, I, I hate to
use him because it's

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.002 align:middle line:84%
like the renaissance
paintings, but whatever

00:32:59.002 --> 00:33:03.269 align:middle line:84%
force is out there is
there, we can't deny that.

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:05.109 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can
deny that at all, yeah

00:33:05.109 --> 00:33:08.301 align:middle line:84%
and I think that some
of the contactees

00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:11.874 align:middle line:84%
have talked about interactions
with beings who have said

00:33:11.874 --> 00:33:12.999 align:middle line:90%
that they believe that too.

00:33:12.999 --> 00:33:14.582 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Well there's,
there is no doubt,

00:33:14.582 --> 00:33:16.415 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be
something else out there.

00:33:16.415 --> 00:33:19.352 align:middle line:84%
There's, there's a force,
there's an intelligence,

00:33:19.352 --> 00:33:22.392 align:middle line:84%
this is not a fluke,
we're not here

00:33:22.392 --> 00:33:24.393 align:middle line:84%
with some accident
working, doing

00:33:24.393 --> 00:33:29.095 align:middle line:84%
what we do in our lives
thinking something's behind it.

00:33:29.095 --> 00:33:34.834 align:middle line:84%
I, I don't think specifically
it is a man in a cloud at all,

00:33:34.834 --> 00:33:37.924 align:middle line:84%
but there is some kind
of force in the universe,

00:33:37.924 --> 00:33:41.340 align:middle line:84%
we call it God for lack of
a better understanding of,

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.027 align:middle line:84%
of what it could be, but I
am convinced that humankind

00:33:46.027 --> 00:33:50.383 align:middle line:84%
probably started by
some genetic altering

00:33:50.383 --> 00:33:54.353 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrials who
themselves are probably looking

00:33:54.353 --> 00:33:59.058 align:middle line:84%
for that same answer who
created us, how did we get here,

00:33:59.058 --> 00:34:02.028 align:middle line:84%
and this might be a series
that has gone on and on and on,

00:34:02.028 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:90%
but I think we were jumpstarted.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.965 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah, I think it makes
sense, I mean it's logical.

00:34:06.965 --> 00:34:10.336 align:middle line:84%
Lot of the stuff is just
logical because look

00:34:10.336 --> 00:34:12.438 align:middle line:90%
at what we're doing today.

00:34:12.438 --> 00:34:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Can you project
the future about...

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.459 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Oh my gosh!

00:34:15.459 --> 00:34:16.876 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: You know 600
years from now.

00:34:16.876 --> 00:34:19.452 align:middle line:84%
We might be genetically
having children.

00:34:19.452 --> 00:34:21.285 align:middle line:84%
You know, I, I hear you
can pick whether you

00:34:21.285 --> 00:34:23.215 align:middle line:90%
want a boy or girl today.

00:34:23.215 --> 00:34:25.799 align:middle line:84%
So I mean things
really advance, I just

00:34:25.799 --> 00:34:29.238 align:middle line:84%
hope that we don't lose, you
know, what's called our soul,

00:34:29.238 --> 00:34:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and you know, our
compassion, our, our essence,

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.895 align:middle line:84%
I think whoever is out there
is really interested in humans

00:34:35.895 --> 00:34:38.821 align:middle line:84%
because we have
this ability to love

00:34:38.821 --> 00:34:41.129 align:middle line:84%
and have emotions
and, and sacrifice,

00:34:41.129 --> 00:34:43.336 align:middle line:84%
even though we have
that other side.

00:34:43.336 --> 00:34:46.739 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're interested
in the human capacity to love.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:49.235 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Well they're
growing body parts now on,

00:34:49.235 --> 00:34:50.175 align:middle line:90%
on little animals.

00:34:50.175 --> 00:34:54.079 align:middle line:84%
You know they, they grew
a human ear on a mouse.

00:34:54.079 --> 00:35:00.921 align:middle line:84%
They grew a person's nose on
his arm and pretty interesting,

00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:01.721 align:middle line:90%
huh?

00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:05.958 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Yeah, well I think that's,
that's we're going very fast

00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:09.283 align:middle line:84%
into a, all kinds
of new discoveries

00:35:09.283 --> 00:35:12.072 align:middle line:84%
even on a genetic
level that, you know,

00:35:12.072 --> 00:35:14.767 align:middle line:84%
I'm, I'm wondering about
the whole idea of cloning.

00:35:14.767 --> 00:35:16.235 align:middle line:84%
You, you want to
go there, that's,

00:35:16.235 --> 00:35:17.803 align:middle line:90%
that's gets very strange.

00:35:17.803 --> 00:35:19.038 align:middle line:90%

that will happen.

00:35:20.873 --> 00:35:23.910 align:middle line:84%

today with what they're doing,

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:27.410 align:middle line:84%

thing to me that's scary

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.983 align:middle line:84%
and I, and again, I think
our extraterrestrial brothers

00:35:30.983 --> 00:35:33.052 align:middle line:84%
and sisters use
techniques like this,

00:35:33.052 --> 00:35:37.957 align:middle line:84%
but now they're putting
body parts into animals

00:35:37.957 --> 00:35:39.567 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to grow them, you

00:35:39.567 --> 00:35:42.912 align:middle line:84%
know they're going to
grow a liver in a pig

00:35:42.912 --> 00:35:47.129 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be a human liver,
but it'll be grown in a pig

00:35:47.129 --> 00:35:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to take
that out and put it in a human

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.299 align:middle line:84%
and I'm wondering what will
happen one day to that human,

00:35:54.299 --> 00:35:56.953 align:middle line:84%
I mean will he have
characteristics of a pig?

00:35:56.953 --> 00:35:58.911 align:middle line:84%
Is he going to wake up
in the morning and oink?

00:35:58.911 --> 00:36:00.977 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's
going to happen?

00:36:00.977 --> 00:36:03.352 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Those are questions I
hope that the scientists that

00:36:03.352 --> 00:36:05.769 align:middle line:84%
are doing that I hope they
asked that question themselves.

00:36:05.769 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: But it's going to happen.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.087 align:middle line:90%

progression of science

00:36:11.015 --> 00:36:14.196 align:middle line:84%
every few years is
dramatic all by itself.

00:36:14.196 --> 00:36:16.404 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: You know, one of the
things that Colonel Philip

00:36:16.404 --> 00:36:19.596 align:middle line:84%
Corso told me was that when,
when he was doing the research

00:36:19.596 --> 00:36:23.486 align:middle line:84%
on this at the beings that
were in the Roswell craft,

00:36:23.486 --> 00:36:27.338 align:middle line:84%
interacting with the craft,
they had a helmet that could

00:36:27.338 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:90%
interact with the...

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.736 align:middle line:84%
kind of a metal helmet
that would interact

00:36:30.736 --> 00:36:33.855 align:middle line:84%
with the craft and the craft
and the being would become one,

00:36:33.855 --> 00:36:38.317 align:middle line:84%
so he, he asked, he would
talk about putting implants

00:36:38.317 --> 00:36:41.262 align:middle line:84%
in people's brains and how that
would be in the future, which

00:36:41.262 --> 00:36:44.805 align:middle line:84%
would be artificial intelligence
and we get into some really

00:36:44.805 --> 00:36:48.418 align:middle line:84%
ethical questions here, we
get into some real serious

00:36:48.418 --> 00:36:50.266 align:middle line:84%
discussion, that's why
I wish we would talk

00:36:50.266 --> 00:36:51.974 align:middle line:84%
about this because
it's also interesting,

00:36:51.974 --> 00:36:54.595 align:middle line:84%
but if we could do
it without ridicule,

00:36:54.595 --> 00:36:57.751 align:middle line:84%
can you imagine what kind
of interesting discussions

00:36:57.751 --> 00:36:58.971 align:middle line:90%
we could all have?

00:36:58.971 --> 00:37:02.274 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: I interviewed a person on
Coast to Coast who's a cyborg.

00:37:02.274 --> 00:37:06.846 align:middle line:84%
He's got chips in his system to
be able to do different things

00:37:06.846 --> 00:37:08.706 align:middle line:84%

to be a matter of time

00:37:08.706 --> 00:37:11.591 align:middle line:84%
where you and I will be able
to communicate with each other

00:37:11.591 --> 00:37:14.935 align:middle line:84%
just with mind thought because
it'd be almost like we have

00:37:14.935 --> 00:37:17.898 align:middle line:84%
little telephones in our head,
you know, and I'll think Paola,

00:37:17.898 --> 00:37:19.125 align:middle line:90%
Paola are you getting this?

00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:20.126 align:middle line:90%
And, and you will.

a million years ahead of us or

00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:31.572 align:middle line:84%
They've done some
incredible things with us

00:37:31.572 --> 00:37:34.594 align:middle line:84%

mentioned Adam and Eve,

00:37:34.594 --> 00:37:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I think Adam and Eve
were the first humans,

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.420 align:middle line:84%
but they were
genetically created

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:44.150 align:middle line:90%
and then from them others came.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:47.453 align:middle line:84%

possible, I mean it's logical.

this is a gorgeous place.

00:37:54.527 --> 00:37:58.631 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's going downhill,
but it's a beautiful planet.

00:37:58.631 --> 00:38:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean it is, I, I've just
travelled all over, you know,

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.204 align:middle line:84%
Europe and seen the beauty that,
that we have on this planet

00:38:05.204 --> 00:38:09.608 align:middle line:84%
and I think that in order to
have that you have to have

00:38:09.608 --> 00:38:12.546 align:middle line:84%
an appreciation for that, so
you have to have a human being

00:38:12.546 --> 00:38:13.546 align:middle line:90%
appreciating the planet.

00:38:13.546 --> 00:38:14.847 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Sure.

00:38:14.847 --> 00:38:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: And I think that, you
know, why were we created?

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.386 align:middle line:84%
Probably, you know,
Monsignor Balducci, he was,

00:38:20.386 --> 00:38:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I just really miss him, he
said to bring glory to God.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.625 align:middle line:84%
He said the more people that are
created all over the universe,

00:38:26.625 --> 00:38:28.465 align:middle line:84%
the more people can
bring glory to God,

00:38:28.465 --> 00:38:30.596 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well,
that's pretty cool.

00:38:30.596 --> 00:38:33.536 align:middle line:84%
In, in other words why would
it be just humans doing that

00:38:33.536 --> 00:38:36.294 align:middle line:84%
because what we have out
there, and, we've only

00:38:36.294 --> 00:38:37.236 align:middle line:90%
seen planet earth.

00:38:37.236 --> 00:38:40.608 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine all the planets,
how gorgeous they could be?

00:38:40.608 --> 00:38:42.775 align:middle line:84%
Remember Science Fiction,
you remember the pictures?

00:38:42.775 --> 00:38:43.976 align:middle line:90%
>>GN: Absolutely.

00:38:43.976 --> 00:38:45.044 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: Wow [inaudible] and
also could be beautiful.

00:38:45.044 --> 00:38:46.855 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: They just found
a blue dot planet,

00:38:46.855 --> 00:38:48.272 align:middle line:84%
which means that
they're convinced

00:38:48.272 --> 00:38:50.696 align:middle line:84%
it might have some
water on it because it

00:38:50.696 --> 00:38:52.118 align:middle line:90%
looks like Earth from afar.

00:38:52.118 --> 00:38:56.105 align:middle line:84%
But they said the average
temperature on the planet

00:38:56.105 --> 00:39:00.159 align:middle line:84%
is 2000 degrees and
that the winds howl

00:39:00.159 --> 00:39:02.328 align:middle line:90%
at 4000 miles an hour.

00:39:02.328 --> 00:39:03.963 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine that?

00:39:03.963 --> 00:39:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And that it rains glass,
what kind of a planet

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:90%
would that be then?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.424 align:middle line:84%
But that we're very
lucky to have what

00:39:10.424 --> 00:39:13.101 align:middle line:84%
we have here, which
is the basis for life,

00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:15.482 align:middle line:84%
but I think there're
many planets like that,

00:39:15.482 --> 00:39:17.610 align:middle line:84%
that have that and,
and I'm convinced

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:19.689 align:middle line:84%
that if you find a
planet like Earth that

00:39:19.689 --> 00:39:24.066 align:middle line:84%
has the same kind of temperature
and has water, life like this

00:39:24.066 --> 00:39:25.384 align:middle line:90%
is going to evolve.

00:39:25.384 --> 00:39:28.487 align:middle line:84%
The big question is
then how far does it go?

00:39:28.487 --> 00:39:30.556 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to
get to that planet

00:39:30.556 --> 00:39:32.658 align:middle line:90%
and jumpstart it a little bit?

00:39:32.658 --> 00:39:36.128 align:middle line:84%
And here we are because I'm
not a believer that we started

00:39:36.128 --> 00:39:37.656 align:middle line:90%
from little microorganisms.

00:39:37.656 --> 00:39:39.198 align:middle line:84%

just would take...

00:39:39.198 --> 00:39:40.531 align:middle line:90%

00:39:40.531 --> 00:39:42.267 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: It would take
a long time, let's

00:39:42.267 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:90%
face it with microorganisms.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Did you see the film Mission to
Mars which is one of, I loved

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.340 align:middle line:90%
that because...

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GN: Yeah, I did, it
didn't go over too well

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:50.350 align:middle line:90%
at the box office.

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:53.612 align:middle line:84%
>>PH: No, because, it didn't
go over too well because they,

00:39:53.612 --> 00:39:56.715 align:middle line:84%
they talked about Cydonia,
and from what I understand,

00:39:56.715 --> 00:39:59.165 align:middle line:84%
Brian De Palma made a
deal not to go there

00:39:59.165 --> 00:40:01.453 align:middle line:84%
and he even had to
leave the country when,

00:40:01.453 --> 00:40:04.123 align:middle line:84%
when the film came up,
but in Italy it did.

00:40:04.123 --> 00:40:05.457 align:middle line:90%
In Italy, it was a big hit.

00:40:05.457 --> 00:40:08.225 align:middle line:84%
Now how come that film was a
great in Italy and everybody

00:40:08.225 --> 00:40:12.631 align:middle line:84%
went to see it and here it
was not promoted as much.

00:40:12.631 --> 00:40:15.934 align:middle line:84%
But in that film you
see the female alien

00:40:15.934 --> 00:40:19.694 align:middle line:84%
showing the DNA and the
progression of how that

00:40:19.694 --> 00:40:23.831 align:middle line:84%
happened on planet Earth,
that the people from Mars, had

00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:27.379 align:middle line:84%
to because of catastrophe, let's
hope this doesn't happen here,

00:40:27.379 --> 00:40:29.949 align:middle line:84%
had to migrate to
another planet?

00:40:29.949 --> 00:40:33.796 align:middle line:84%
And you know maybe we need
to look at all these science

00:40:33.796 --> 00:40:36.205 align:middle line:84%
fiction films because maybe
there is some truth in some

00:40:36.205 --> 00:40:37.089 align:middle line:90%
of these you know.

00:40:37.089 --> 00:40:38.324 align:middle line:90%

00:40:38.324 --> 00:40:41.044 align:middle line:84%
Where did they get the
information for these films?

get some inside info?

00:40:45.696 --> 00:40:48.268 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: There's I think that
that's one of the things that I

00:40:48.268 --> 00:40:49.068 align:middle line:90%
think that...

00:40:49.068 --> 00:40:51.744 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Mission Mars I
know Richard Hoagland told me

00:40:51.744 --> 00:40:55.807 align:middle line:84%
he had been friends with Brian
De Palma's brother, Bruce,

00:40:55.807 --> 00:40:57.409 align:middle line:90%
who was in MIT.

00:40:57.409 --> 00:41:01.646 align:middle line:84%
And that they had agreed as
a homage to Bruce who I think

00:41:01.646 --> 00:41:02.514 align:middle line:90%
died of cancer...

00:41:02.514 --> 00:41:03.515 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He did.

00:41:03.515 --> 00:41:04.216 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: that they
would tell the truth.

00:41:04.216 --> 00:41:06.878 align:middle line:84%
So they told the truth so it
wasn't big box office hit here,

00:41:06.878 --> 00:41:07.753 align:middle line:90%
but it was in Europe.

00:41:07.753 --> 00:41:10.055 align:middle line:84%
I was in Italy and
it was a big...

00:41:10.055 --> 00:41:11.423 align:middle line:90%
explain that to me.

00:41:11.423 --> 00:41:13.838 align:middle line:84%

to myself, alright,

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:15.463 align:middle line:84%
well that's an
interesting, well that's

00:41:15.463 --> 00:41:17.671 align:middle line:84%
one of the most interesting,
what you want to go back

00:41:17.671 --> 00:41:19.265 align:middle line:90%
to 2001 Space Odyssey?

00:41:19.265 --> 00:41:20.499 align:middle line:90%

I was very young when that came

00:41:24.483 --> 00:41:26.839 align:middle line:90%
out and I tried to digest that.

00:41:26.839 --> 00:41:29.683 align:middle line:84%
And then we have artificial
intelligence, with,

00:41:29.683 --> 00:41:30.509 align:middle line:90%
that's Cooper too.

00:41:33.112 --> 00:41:36.348 align:middle line:84%
In that film the beings
go to the little boy

00:41:36.348 --> 00:41:38.652 align:middle line:84%
and say we have no
memory of Planet Earth,

00:41:38.652 --> 00:41:40.629 align:middle line:84%
we only have you,
who has a memory

00:41:40.629 --> 00:41:42.755 align:middle line:84%
and then they clone
his mother for a day.

00:41:42.755 --> 00:41:46.458 align:middle line:84%

hair and they the DNA to clone.

films, if you put them together,

00:41:49.261 --> 00:41:51.664 align:middle line:84%

class called Science Fiction

00:41:51.664 --> 00:41:52.665 align:middle line:90%

00:41:52.665 --> 00:41:54.667 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: That would
be well attended.

00:41:54.667 --> 00:41:55.768 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: Wow!

00:41:55.768 --> 00:41:56.001 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:56.001 --> 00:41:57.870 align:middle line:84%
You know I'd teach
that in two minutes.

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, I love
the whole idea.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.143 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is you know
there's a lot of true,

00:42:04.143 --> 00:42:06.145 align:middle line:84%
and there's, what we
thought as science fiction

00:42:06.145 --> 00:42:09.281 align:middle line:84%
as you just mentioned with
the cloning, the parts,

00:42:09.281 --> 00:42:11.517 align:middle line:90%
is becoming reality today.

00:42:11.517 --> 00:42:12.484 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It sure is.

00:42:12.484 --> 00:42:13.901 align:middle line:84%
They're making
them from printers.

00:42:13.901 --> 00:42:14.753 align:middle line:90%
3D printers.

00:42:14.753 --> 00:42:16.556 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
for Paola Harris.

00:42:16.556 --> 00:42:17.356 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:42:17.356 --> 00:42:18.891 align:middle line:90%
Yes, way over here.

00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:23.162 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned 2001 A Space
Odyssey by Arthur C. Clark,

00:42:23.162 --> 00:42:27.306 align:middle line:84%
have you ever read A Childhood's
End and do you think that is

00:42:27.306 --> 00:42:32.265 align:middle line:84%
an accurate description of what
it will be like after contact

00:42:32.265 --> 00:42:35.310 align:middle line:84%
has been made
publicly worldwide.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: Well you know Childhood's
End the overlords come over

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:42.014 align:middle line:84%
and take over so, what we got
going is an alien invasion.

00:42:42.014 --> 00:42:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But what had happened in
that, that book, and I used

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.593 align:middle line:84%
to teach that because I
was an English teacher, so,

00:42:48.593 --> 00:42:51.500 align:middle line:84%
what has happened in that
book is that humanity just

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.479 align:middle line:84%
didn't you know, pull its
weight and the overlords

00:42:54.479 --> 00:42:57.746 align:middle line:84%
or the beings that decided
to take the children away,

00:42:57.746 --> 00:42:58.697 align:middle line:90%
off the planets.

00:42:58.697 --> 00:43:01.000 align:middle line:90%
So, no, I hope not.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.968 align:middle line:84%
I hope we get it
together, I hope

00:43:02.968 --> 00:43:06.105 align:middle line:84%
that they don't come here
and take the children away,

00:43:06.105 --> 00:43:09.307 align:middle line:84%
because you know they're saving
the children because we've

00:43:09.307 --> 00:43:12.177 align:middle line:90%
actually messed everything up.

00:43:12.177 --> 00:43:14.333 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't believe
in an alien, they

00:43:14.333 --> 00:43:16.023 align:middle line:84%
could have done
it a long ago, I'm

00:43:16.023 --> 00:43:18.841 align:middle line:84%
not into false flagger
alien invasion or peer

00:43:18.841 --> 00:43:20.519 align:middle line:90%
mongering or any of that stuff.

00:43:20.519 --> 00:43:21.787 align:middle line:90%
That's just me.

00:43:21.787 --> 00:43:25.094 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Alright, and you probably
have some people too who would

00:43:25.094 --> 00:43:27.192 align:middle line:90%
say we're not being visited.

00:43:27.192 --> 00:43:30.596 align:middle line:84%
This is all nonsense, we're
alone in the universe,

00:43:30.596 --> 00:43:34.133 align:middle line:90%
there's nobody else out there.

00:43:34.133 --> 00:43:37.736 align:middle line:84%
Like I said earlier, you
can't convince these people.

00:43:37.736 --> 00:43:39.138 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: No, and that's okay.

00:43:39.138 --> 00:43:43.175 align:middle line:84%
Its okay, it's not
about convincing them.

00:43:43.175 --> 00:43:45.978 align:middle line:84%
They'll, if it's meant to
be, they'll read something

00:43:45.978 --> 00:43:48.447 align:middle line:84%
or you know maybe
they'll have a sighting

00:43:48.447 --> 00:43:50.916 align:middle line:90%
like some people have had.

00:43:50.916 --> 00:43:52.778 align:middle line:84%
So, you know I
think that's okay,

00:43:52.778 --> 00:43:56.913 align:middle line:84%
but I think for the people who
have the least bit of curiosity

00:43:56.913 --> 00:44:00.737 align:middle line:84%
about who we are, where we
came from, what's going on,

00:44:00.737 --> 00:44:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and who'll look
up at the stars, I

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:05.266 align:middle line:84%
think it's very important
to talk about this.

00:44:05.266 --> 00:44:07.266 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's take some
more questions for Paula.

00:44:07.266 --> 00:44:08.367 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

00:44:08.367 --> 00:44:11.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Leading physicists
today, Ray Kurzweil,

00:44:11.937 --> 00:44:16.316 align:middle line:84%
Michio Kaku who you
mentioned, speak of different

00:44:16.316 --> 00:44:19.128 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, type
zero through 5,

00:44:19.128 --> 00:44:23.229 align:middle line:84%
regarding where we're going
to be in the future and some

00:44:23.229 --> 00:44:27.886 align:middle line:84%
of the projects they're
working on project 2045 with

00:44:27.886 --> 00:44:32.368 align:middle line:84%
singularity, where they're
trying to put consciousness

00:44:32.368 --> 00:44:34.193 align:middle line:90%
into a computer.

00:44:34.193 --> 00:44:36.528 align:middle line:84%
Can you comment on where
we would have to be,

00:44:36.528 --> 00:44:39.102 align:middle line:84%
what kind of
civilization we would

00:44:39.102 --> 00:44:41.567 align:middle line:90%
have to reach to get there?

00:44:41.567 --> 00:44:44.536 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And right now we're on
the bottom of the totem pole

00:44:44.536 --> 00:44:50.025 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a civilization, we
haven't elevated much as Michio

00:44:50.025 --> 00:44:53.567 align:middle line:84%
Kaku would say you know we need
many more points to graduate

00:44:53.567 --> 00:44:54.813 align:middle line:90%
and get up there.

00:44:54.813 --> 00:44:56.348 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: Yeah, like a Type 1.

00:44:56.348 --> 00:45:01.987 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that putting
consciousness into a computer,

00:45:01.987 --> 00:45:05.123 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering about
the consciousness.

00:45:05.123 --> 00:45:07.926 align:middle line:84%
Because right now we need to
work on our consciousness.

00:45:07.926 --> 00:45:12.064 align:middle line:84%
So, I don't know why we would
put all this effort and money

00:45:12.064 --> 00:45:14.366 align:middle line:84%
into putting consciousness
into a computer.

00:45:14.366 --> 00:45:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you that one of
the people I admire most

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:19.505 align:middle line:90%
in the field is Grant Cameron.

00:45:19.505 --> 00:45:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Who UFO you know presidents.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.277 align:middle line:84%
He has just switched over
to consciousness studies.

00:45:25.277 --> 00:45:29.459 align:middle line:84%
Because he has finished doing
all the history of the UFO

00:45:29.459 --> 00:45:32.078 align:middle line:84%
presidency, his
book is amazing, I

00:45:32.078 --> 00:45:34.286 align:middle line:84%
think you know everybody
should read everybody else's

00:45:34.286 --> 00:45:37.089 align:middle line:84%
book so we could all
get this together.

00:45:37.089 --> 00:45:41.026 align:middle line:84%
And he, he's going into
consciousness study,

00:45:41.026 --> 00:45:43.428 align:middle line:90%
the study of consciousness.

00:45:43.428 --> 00:45:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Which is a secret and he talks
about this to the UFO situation

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.570 align:middle line:84%
when Ben Rich said we
have the technology

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:56.988 align:middle line:84%
to bring ET back home, and then
Jan Harsen who is with Mufon

00:45:56.988 --> 00:45:59.488 align:middle line:84%
[phonetic] goes up to him and
says how does that happen.

00:45:59.488 --> 00:46:01.446 align:middle line:84%
And he says do you, what
do you know about ESP?

00:46:01.446 --> 00:46:04.506 align:middle line:84%
This is Ben Rich, they
had a Lockheed Martin

00:46:04.506 --> 00:46:05.351 align:middle line:90%
who's saying this.

00:46:05.351 --> 00:46:06.151 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:46:06.151 --> 00:46:08.353 align:middle line:90%
What do you know about ESP?

00:46:08.353 --> 00:46:10.956 align:middle line:84%
Well let's go back to
where Colonel Corso said

00:46:10.956 --> 00:46:13.926 align:middle line:84%
about the being
interacting with the craft.

00:46:13.926 --> 00:46:16.728 align:middle line:84%
So, there you go about
you know going to looking

00:46:16.728 --> 00:46:20.666 align:middle line:90%
at putting into a machine.

00:46:20.666 --> 00:46:23.466 align:middle line:84%
However conscious is split,
but we got a long ways

00:46:23.466 --> 00:46:26.577 align:middle line:84%
to go, I mean, we got
some serious problems

00:46:26.577 --> 00:46:27.673 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:46:27.673 --> 00:46:30.242 align:middle line:90%
Some serious value issues.

00:46:30.242 --> 00:46:31.977 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody
is on survival mode

00:46:31.977 --> 00:46:34.513 align:middle line:84%
and in Europe the crisis
is worse than here,

00:46:34.513 --> 00:46:38.717 align:middle line:84%
and they were just, they were
just depressed politically

00:46:38.717 --> 00:46:39.751 align:middle line:90%
when I was over there.

00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:41.787 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is much
happier over here.

00:46:41.787 --> 00:46:45.395 align:middle line:84%
But, we need to get
past our problems

00:46:45.395 --> 00:46:49.919 align:middle line:84%
on the planet to get into
the level of spirituality

00:46:49.919 --> 00:46:52.097 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness and
come together as one.

00:46:52.097 --> 00:46:54.305 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said, how are you
going to speak to an alien

00:46:54.305 --> 00:46:56.268 align:middle line:84%
if you can't speak to
the guy next to you?

00:46:56.268 --> 00:47:00.072 align:middle line:84%
So we've got some serious
value issues with this.

00:47:00.072 --> 00:47:03.241 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's take another
question for Paola Harris.

00:47:03.241 --> 00:47:04.643 align:middle line:90%
Who's got one?

00:47:04.643 --> 00:47:09.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, I was in the navy for 12
years and a lot of what I got

00:47:09.748 --> 00:47:11.559 align:middle line:84%
to see, being in
communications was,

00:47:11.559 --> 00:47:12.851 align:middle line:90%
we had a lot of disinformation.

00:47:12.851 --> 00:47:16.291 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that
that's part of what's

00:47:16.291 --> 00:47:19.591 align:middle line:84%
going on with the government
that they put out information

00:47:19.591 --> 00:47:22.412 align:middle line:84%
that is not a 100%
so they can say

00:47:22.412 --> 00:47:23.829 align:middle line:84%
that they're giving
us information

00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:25.230 align:middle line:90%
but they're really not?

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:26.424 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Misinformation?

00:47:26.424 --> 00:47:27.966 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: That's a
really good question.

00:47:27.966 --> 00:47:29.101 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:29.101 --> 00:47:31.603 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the navy is
very involved in UFOs.

00:47:31.603 --> 00:47:32.904 align:middle line:90%
Very involved.

00:47:32.904 --> 00:47:37.309 align:middle line:84%
In fact a lot of the pilots
in NASA were navy pilots.

00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:39.771 align:middle line:84%
Early astronauts,
NASA were navy pilots.

00:47:39.771 --> 00:47:40.571 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:40.571 --> 00:47:43.181 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's really
the way it works.

00:47:43.181 --> 00:47:47.986 align:middle line:84%
What happens is you get a real
story, a real picture, and then

00:47:47.986 --> 00:47:51.290 align:middle line:84%
you have the one that you
know is done on Photoshop

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:52.658 align:middle line:90%
that comes right after it.

00:47:52.658 --> 00:47:55.628 align:middle line:84%
So you throw the
whole thing out or you

00:47:55.628 --> 00:47:58.397 align:middle line:84%
know disinformation or
discreditation of the witness.

00:47:58.397 --> 00:48:00.699 align:middle line:84%
They find something
about your past.

00:48:00.699 --> 00:48:02.634 align:middle line:90%
And then it's all cancelled out.

00:48:02.634 --> 00:48:06.838 align:middle line:84%
I mean, disinformation is
mixed in with the real stuff.

00:48:06.838 --> 00:48:09.308 align:middle line:84%
People ask about the
famous alien autopsy.

00:48:09.308 --> 00:48:11.209 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the
Santali footage?

00:48:11.209 --> 00:48:14.144 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced, because I was
in Europe when this was all

00:48:14.144 --> 00:48:16.487 align:middle line:84%
coming done and my
boss at the magazine

00:48:16.487 --> 00:48:20.028 align:middle line:84%
was working with Santali that
there are about 5 or 6 frames

00:48:20.028 --> 00:48:21.720 align:middle line:90%
in that that are real.

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.823 align:middle line:84%
And then they had to create
the rest of it that isn't real,

00:48:24.823 --> 00:48:26.591 align:middle line:84%
so what they had to
do then is backtrack

00:48:26.591 --> 00:48:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and say the whole
thing wasn't real.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.329 align:middle line:84%
But it was an effort,
a very strange effort

00:48:31.329 --> 00:48:34.166 align:middle line:90%
to get the material out there.

00:48:34.166 --> 00:48:36.034 align:middle line:90%
Because what happens?

00:48:36.034 --> 00:48:40.465 align:middle line:84%
All television stations carry
this thing so everybody is

00:48:40.465 --> 00:48:42.442 align:middle line:84%
thinking, oh, my
God this is the...

00:48:42.442 --> 00:48:43.275 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: This is it...

00:48:43.275 --> 00:48:44.476 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: You know this is it.

00:48:44.476 --> 00:48:46.712 align:middle line:84%
This is the real stuff
and it brings an awareness

00:48:46.712 --> 00:48:50.382 align:middle line:84%
and then you get pulled
back that it is not real

00:48:50.382 --> 00:48:52.743 align:middle line:84%
but there are 4 or 5
frames that are real.

00:48:52.743 --> 00:48:53.785 align:middle line:90%
So what do you want to...

00:48:53.785 --> 00:48:55.454 align:middle line:90%
this is the way the thing works.

00:48:55.454 --> 00:48:56.855 align:middle line:90%
That's what's so bad.

00:48:56.855 --> 00:49:00.295 align:middle line:84%
And what's even worse today
is that our own people,

00:49:00.295 --> 00:49:03.477 align:middle line:84%
our people, lot of my own
colleagues become debunkers

00:49:03.477 --> 00:49:06.013 align:middle line:84%
when the thing is
real and I think

00:49:06.013 --> 00:49:11.136 align:middle line:84%
I always put on my Facebook
page, opinion is not research.

00:49:11.136 --> 00:49:13.305 align:middle line:84%
So you have to like
analyze the whole film,

00:49:13.305 --> 00:49:15.435 align:middle line:84%
analyze the whole
picture, you have

00:49:15.435 --> 00:49:18.445 align:middle line:84%
to take it into a studio
and that costs money.

00:49:18.445 --> 00:49:19.778 align:middle line:90%
So they're not going to do that.

00:49:19.778 --> 00:49:20.590 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say,
that doesn't look

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:21.947 align:middle line:90%
real, that looks like a fake.

00:49:21.947 --> 00:49:24.683 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll write, fake,
without ever doing anything.

00:49:24.683 --> 00:49:27.252 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that's a
good question about,

00:49:27.252 --> 00:49:28.697 align:middle line:90%
yeah, there's disinformation.

00:49:28.697 --> 00:49:30.155 align:middle line:84%
And does the
government put it out?

00:49:30.155 --> 00:49:32.858 align:middle line:84%
I think there is this, that
happened in the beginning,

00:49:32.858 --> 00:49:35.942 align:middle line:84%
specially with Roswell,
the first newspaper

00:49:35.942 --> 00:49:38.653 align:middle line:84%
was that it was a crash
saucer, the second

00:49:38.653 --> 00:49:41.534 align:middle line:84%
is it's a weather balloon and
now we go into weather balloons

00:49:41.534 --> 00:49:42.334 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:44.536 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: And then project
mogul with dummies.

00:49:44.536 --> 00:49:46.538 align:middle line:90%
And they kept changing it.

00:49:46.538 --> 00:49:49.141 align:middle line:84%
Let's take one last
question for Paula Harris.

00:49:49.141 --> 00:49:50.442 align:middle line:90%
Somebody here had a question.

00:49:50.442 --> 00:49:51.643 align:middle line:90%
Yes sir?

00:49:51.643 --> 00:49:55.213 align:middle line:84%
>> Paola, in your informed
opinion how many extra

00:49:55.213 --> 00:49:59.384 align:middle line:84%
terrestrials groups are
we dealing with here?

00:49:59.384 --> 00:50:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Historically and presently.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.257 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: Okay, now you have to
remember the, in the beginning

00:50:05.257 --> 00:50:09.060 align:middle line:84%
of the 1950s we had the space
brother movement with Adamski,

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.228 align:middle line:90%
Van Tassel and all that.

00:50:10.228 --> 00:50:11.530 align:middle line:90%
They were human.

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:15.392 align:middle line:84%
Then Betty and Barny Hill
were taken and then the grey

00:50:15.392 --> 00:50:16.192 align:middle line:90%
situation came in.

00:50:16.192 --> 00:50:16.992 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:50:16.992 --> 00:50:17.969 align:middle line:90%
That was in the50s.

00:50:17.969 --> 00:50:19.437 align:middle line:90%
So now everything is grey.

00:50:19.437 --> 00:50:20.772 align:middle line:90%
Little grey beings.

00:50:20.772 --> 00:50:24.618 align:middle line:84%
Then all at once and in Brazil
we have the Virginia case with

00:50:24.618 --> 00:50:27.354 align:middle line:84%
the little being that
was, and that's recent,

00:50:27.354 --> 00:50:29.760 align:middle line:84%
he was taken to the
hospital and he was,

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.335 align:middle line:84%
he had reddish skin with two
protuberance coming out of his

00:50:33.335 --> 00:50:34.803 align:middle line:84%
head, doesn't look
like any grey.

00:50:34.803 --> 00:50:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's the devil.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.488 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: Yeah.

00:50:36.488 --> 00:50:37.530 align:middle line:90%
He looked like the devil.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:38.557 align:middle line:90%
But it was a real case.

00:50:38.557 --> 00:50:40.685 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
witnesses plus Roger Leer

00:50:40.685 --> 00:50:42.494 align:middle line:90%
wrote a book about this.

00:50:42.494 --> 00:50:46.798 align:middle line:84%
So, and then I did
go to Smith Rudy.

00:50:46.798 --> 00:50:51.002 align:middle line:84%
I did go and investigate like
Wendell Stevens, Billy Meyer

00:50:51.002 --> 00:50:53.605 align:middle line:84%
and I will support
the Billy Meyer case.

00:50:53.605 --> 00:50:54.739 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's very, very...

00:50:54.739 --> 00:50:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: It's real.

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:56.441 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Real case.

00:50:56.441 --> 00:50:57.576 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: It is.

00:50:57.576 --> 00:50:59.451 align:middle line:84%
Those were people that
came out of that craft

00:50:59.451 --> 00:51:02.157 align:middle line:84%
that they were plagirians
and I talked to the people

00:51:02.157 --> 00:51:04.115 align:middle line:84%
in the village and they
saw craft and so forth.

00:51:04.115 --> 00:51:05.584 align:middle line:84%
And you have to go
there and talk to them.

00:51:05.584 --> 00:51:06.351 align:middle line:90%
You can't just...

00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:08.606 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Plus you know what, we
didn't have Photoshop in those

00:51:08.606 --> 00:51:08.820 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:11.624 align:middle line:84%
And [inaudible] came up with
some of the greatest UFO photo

00:51:11.624 --> 00:51:12.424 align:middle line:90%
films ever.

00:51:12.424 --> 00:51:13.625 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: I know.

00:51:13.625 --> 00:51:15.137 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is our own people

00:51:15.137 --> 00:51:17.128 align:middle line:90%
are debunking the Billy Meyer.

00:51:17.128 --> 00:51:19.664 align:middle line:84%
Now what would they do that
without going to Smith Rudy,

00:51:19.664 --> 00:51:21.666 align:middle line:84%
talking to people
in the village.

00:51:21.666 --> 00:51:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I saw Billy and his
group around town

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:29.111 align:middle line:84%
and I even saw the
hole through the tree

00:51:29.111 --> 00:51:34.112 align:middle line:84%
that the, that weapon
you know supposedly did.

00:51:34.112 --> 00:51:36.081 align:middle line:90%
So, you ask me how many.

00:51:36.081 --> 00:51:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I can only tell you what
Clifford Stone told me,

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.318 align:middle line:90%
Clifford Stone crash retrieval.

00:51:40.318 --> 00:51:44.456 align:middle line:84%
The book is Eyes Only,
he told me 57 races

00:51:44.456 --> 00:51:48.684 align:middle line:84%
and Colonel Corso told
me 52 races, categorized

00:51:48.684 --> 00:51:51.363 align:middle line:90%
in the Pentagon.

00:51:51.363 --> 00:51:52.264 align:middle line:90%
So do they know?

00:51:52.264 --> 00:51:53.331 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:54.532 align:middle line:90%
It's logical.

00:51:54.532 --> 00:51:55.571 align:middle line:90%
Of course they know.

00:51:55.571 --> 00:51:57.071 align:middle line:84%
But they can't do
anything about it,

00:51:57.071 --> 00:51:59.371 align:middle line:84%
you can't tell them to
come down and hang out.

00:51:59.371 --> 00:52:01.706 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, there's many races.

00:52:01.706 --> 00:52:04.709 align:middle line:84%
And I think, I find that
extremely interesting

00:52:04.709 --> 00:52:06.478 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hoping
other people will.

00:52:06.478 --> 00:52:07.479 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: I do too.

00:52:07.479 --> 00:52:08.646 align:middle line:90%
I do too.

00:52:08.646 --> 00:52:10.982 align:middle line:90%
Travis Walton, Fire in the Sky.

00:52:10.982 --> 00:52:14.328 align:middle line:84%
Fellow with his
logging friends and he

00:52:14.328 --> 00:52:18.857 align:middle line:84%
got zapped and taken away, they
all passed lie detector tests.

00:52:18.857 --> 00:52:20.961 align:middle line:84%
He remains one of the
most compelling interviews

00:52:20.961 --> 00:52:21.987 align:middle line:90%
I have ever done.

00:52:21.987 --> 00:52:24.029 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: He is, because he
never changes his story.

00:52:24.029 --> 00:52:25.937 align:middle line:84%
And he's not doing it
for any other reason

00:52:25.937 --> 00:52:27.399 align:middle line:90%
except telling the truth.

00:52:27.399 --> 00:52:29.634 align:middle line:84%
You know, he, Travis
is a good friend.

00:52:29.634 --> 00:52:32.524 align:middle line:84%
He came to Italy several
times and he basically

00:52:32.524 --> 00:52:36.177 align:middle line:84%
has the same story and
he's very confused by it,

00:52:36.177 --> 00:52:38.743 align:middle line:84%
because he saw two different
races aboard the ship,

00:52:38.743 --> 00:52:41.479 align:middle line:84%
he saw the greys and
he saw these blondes.

00:52:41.479 --> 00:52:42.990 align:middle line:84%
These blondes, he
called them, he

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:44.782 align:middle line:84%
called them brother
and sister because they

00:52:44.782 --> 00:52:45.784 align:middle line:90%
looked so much alike.

00:52:45.784 --> 00:52:49.888 align:middle line:84%
A male and a female and this
was in Snowflake, Arizona.

00:52:49.888 --> 00:52:54.326 align:middle line:84%
This was in the 1970s and
he was missing for 5 days.

00:52:54.326 --> 00:52:58.095 align:middle line:84%
So much so that the other
lumberjacks who were with him

00:52:58.095 --> 00:52:59.764 align:middle line:84%
were almost
prosecuted for murder.

00:52:59.764 --> 00:53:03.687 align:middle line:84%
So this is, both the movie Fire
in the Sky is not accurate.

00:53:03.687 --> 00:53:05.937 align:middle line:84%
It's there out to scare the
living daylights out of...

00:53:05.937 --> 00:53:07.038 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: It's Hollywood.

00:53:07.038 --> 00:53:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: It's not accurate.

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.864 align:middle line:84%
So if you're seeing
it don't go think

00:53:10.864 --> 00:53:11.977 align:middle line:90%
that that's what happened.

00:53:11.977 --> 00:53:13.745 align:middle line:90%
There was no scariness.

00:53:13.745 --> 00:53:17.309 align:middle line:84%
He basically, I think, was
playing around under the craft

00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:18.767 align:middle line:84%
and when they hit
him with the beam

00:53:18.767 --> 00:53:20.184 align:middle line:84%
I think they could
have killed him

00:53:20.184 --> 00:53:22.954 align:middle line:84%
and maybe he thinks they brought
him to life aboard the craft.

00:53:22.954 --> 00:53:25.889 align:middle line:84%
Because he found himself with
a crystal piece of something

00:53:25.889 --> 00:53:27.392 align:middle line:90%
on his chest.

00:53:27.392 --> 00:53:29.794 align:middle line:84%
Of course when he saw grey
beings he is scared to death

00:53:29.794 --> 00:53:32.697 align:middle line:84%
and almost picked at
something to throw at them.

00:53:32.697 --> 00:53:34.587 align:middle line:84%
What's really crazy
about that story

00:53:34.587 --> 00:53:37.417 align:middle line:84%
though is when he comes
out of the craft he

00:53:37.417 --> 00:53:39.671 align:middle line:84%
is in a hair with
other you know craft

00:53:39.671 --> 00:53:43.174 align:middle line:84%
and he thinks it's
one of our players.

00:53:43.174 --> 00:53:47.746 align:middle line:84%
So it gets to the question,
is there cooperation.

00:53:47.746 --> 00:53:51.649 align:middle line:84%
Which is a major
question in Ufology.

00:53:51.649 --> 00:53:56.753 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: A lot of people, and
I know that abductions is not

00:53:56.753 --> 00:54:00.759 align:middle line:84%
your forte, but something
strange is going on on this

00:54:00.759 --> 00:54:01.559 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:54:01.559 --> 00:54:03.395 align:middle line:84%
You have millions
of people saying

00:54:03.395 --> 00:54:05.063 align:middle line:90%
that they've been abducted.

00:54:05.063 --> 00:54:09.510 align:middle line:84%
They are either all insane,
all delusional, or something

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:11.403 align:middle line:90%
very strange is happening.

00:54:11.403 --> 00:54:13.938 align:middle line:84%
What fascinates me
Paula too, is the theory

00:54:13.938 --> 00:54:18.476 align:middle line:84%
that government is doing this,
to try to mind control people.

00:54:18.476 --> 00:54:19.811 align:middle line:90%
Is that even conceivable?

00:54:19.811 --> 00:54:21.913 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: I think it's
a little bit of both.

00:54:21.913 --> 00:54:26.304 align:middle line:84%
I mean I think that it's
really hard with the abduction

00:54:26.304 --> 00:54:29.012 align:middle line:84%
situation, because we have no
way of proving that like you

00:54:29.012 --> 00:54:32.191 align:middle line:84%
can with the military or
an astronaut or air traffic

00:54:32.191 --> 00:54:32.991 align:middle line:90%
controller.

00:54:32.991 --> 00:54:35.994 align:middle line:84%
So I don't do a whole
bunch of abduction cases

00:54:35.994 --> 00:54:37.595 align:middle line:90%
but I do look into it.

00:54:37.595 --> 00:54:42.267 align:middle line:84%
And I think that some kind
of either hybridization

00:54:42.267 --> 00:54:45.126 align:middle line:84%
or genetic manipulation
is going on.

00:54:45.126 --> 00:54:45.926 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:45.926 --> 00:54:49.574 align:middle line:84%
I think about Hopkins
work and you know,

00:54:49.574 --> 00:54:53.378 align:middle line:84%
and I knew John Mack, Dr. John
Mack, I knew him very well.

00:54:53.378 --> 00:54:56.347 align:middle line:90%
And he, he talked about it.

00:54:56.347 --> 00:54:58.450 align:middle line:90%
We personally talked about it.

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:00.118 align:middle line:90%
There was something going on.

00:55:00.118 --> 00:55:04.022 align:middle line:84%
I think it's backed off a little
bit now, but maybe, I mean,

00:55:04.022 --> 00:55:05.167 align:middle line:90%
do you want to go there?

00:55:05.167 --> 00:55:07.459 align:middle line:84%
If we do something to this
planet there will be nothing

00:55:07.459 --> 00:55:13.031 align:middle line:84%
left of humanity and may be
races trying to save some DNA

00:55:13.031 --> 00:55:14.681 align:middle line:84%
to put it somewhere
else or maybe

00:55:14.681 --> 00:55:16.434 align:middle line:90%
they are creating a hybrid race.

00:55:16.434 --> 00:55:19.204 align:middle line:84%
Could the government
be copycatting it?

00:55:19.204 --> 00:55:21.402 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, I mean
it could be because,

00:55:21.402 --> 00:55:24.054 align:middle line:84%
look we have our
stuff or their stuff

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:27.640 align:middle line:84%
up there, if we have advanced
technology, this thing back

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.482 align:middle line:84%
engineered and I think
Georgia, talks about that.

00:55:30.482 --> 00:55:33.051 align:middle line:84%
At Area 51 and we're
looking at something,

00:55:33.051 --> 00:55:36.254 align:middle line:84%
anymore it gets really
tricky what we're looking at.

00:55:36.254 --> 00:55:40.425 align:middle line:84%
Is it some, you know,
some kind of prototype

00:55:40.425 --> 00:55:41.559 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking at?

00:55:41.559 --> 00:55:45.497 align:middle line:84%
Or is it their stuff or,
it gets really crazy.

00:55:45.497 --> 00:55:47.799 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
yeah, the answer

00:55:47.799 --> 00:55:49.134 align:middle line:90%
is yes, it's a possibility.

00:55:49.134 --> 00:55:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Dr. John Mack, of course,
Harvard trained psychiatrist,

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:57.509 align:middle line:84%
decided to shift his entire
practice from psychiatry

00:55:57.509 --> 00:56:01.829 align:middle line:84%
into alien abductions and that
phenomenon died tragically when

00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:05.683 align:middle line:84%
he stepped off a curb in London
and got hit by a drunk driver.

00:56:05.683 --> 00:56:08.554 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that was
purely an accident?

00:56:08.554 --> 00:56:09.354 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: Uh, huh.

00:56:09.354 --> 00:56:10.688 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: You do.

00:56:10.688 --> 00:56:13.124 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: I do, because he was
with me in Florence, Italy,

00:56:13.124 --> 00:56:14.726 align:middle line:90%
he was looking at all...

00:56:14.726 --> 00:56:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: A leg of that trip?

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.462 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: No, it was
the year before.

00:56:17.462 --> 00:56:18.596 align:middle line:90%
It was the year before.

00:56:18.596 --> 00:56:20.471 align:middle line:84%
We were walking down,
because we had invited,

00:56:20.471 --> 00:56:23.968 align:middle line:84%
it was one of his last lectures,
in fact I have his last,

00:56:23.968 --> 00:56:27.315 align:middle line:84%
one of the last lectures in my
book and he basically walking

00:56:27.315 --> 00:56:29.773 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the street
and there were all these little

00:56:29.773 --> 00:56:30.648 align:middle line:90%
motor, these motor...

00:56:30.648 --> 00:56:31.876 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Scooters and stuff?

00:56:31.876 --> 00:56:35.363 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: I took my elbow
and I pushed him back

00:56:35.363 --> 00:56:36.314 align:middle line:90%
on the sidewalk.

00:56:36.314 --> 00:56:38.314 align:middle line:84%
Because you know he would
walk around like this,

00:56:38.314 --> 00:56:40.761 align:middle line:84%
you know kind of hunched
down and was just

00:56:40.761 --> 00:56:42.738 align:middle line:84%
fascinated with
everything, with the Duomo,

00:56:42.738 --> 00:56:45.290 align:middle line:84%
with the Pitti Palace and
everything in Florence.

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:49.466 align:middle line:84%
And I just really believe that
you don't go walking around

00:56:49.466 --> 00:56:52.615 align:middle line:84%
London at 10:30 at night,
when you're looking you know,

00:56:52.615 --> 00:56:54.032 align:middle line:84%
you have to look
the opposite way.

00:56:54.032 --> 00:56:55.157 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: With your head down.

00:56:55.157 --> 00:56:57.699 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: With your head down, you
have to look the opposite way

00:56:57.699 --> 00:56:59.904 align:middle line:84%
because they drive on the
opposite side of the road.

00:56:59.904 --> 00:57:03.508 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a drunk
driver you know, I think.

00:57:03.508 --> 00:57:05.564 align:middle line:84%
You want to hear an
interesting story though,

00:57:05.564 --> 00:57:07.600 align:middle line:84%
he was interested
in life after death

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.748 align:middle line:84%
and he was looking into
that as a new book.

00:57:10.748 --> 00:57:14.945 align:middle line:84%
And by accident or what he said
to Mark Cummings, with whom he

00:57:14.945 --> 00:57:17.623 align:middle line:84%
was working, I could do a
better job on the other side.

00:57:17.623 --> 00:57:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: Well, he's there now.

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:20.592 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: And that is very strange.

00:57:20.592 --> 00:57:22.794 align:middle line:84%
I could do a better
job on the other side.

00:57:22.794 --> 00:57:24.762 align:middle line:90%
So it, he's there now.

00:57:24.762 --> 00:57:26.064 align:middle line:90%
In fact I am getting shivers.

00:57:26.064 --> 00:57:27.966 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Strange how
these things happen.

00:57:27.966 --> 00:57:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: I loved that man.

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:32.937 align:middle line:84%
He was very logical, he
was very compassionate.

00:57:32.937 --> 00:57:36.641 align:middle line:84%
I never heard him say anything
negative about anybody

00:57:36.641 --> 00:57:41.145 align:middle line:84%
and he really did a great job
on the abduction phenomenon.

00:57:41.145 --> 00:57:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GN: He sure did.

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.515 align:middle line:84%
Paola, people want more
information on what you do.

00:57:44.515 --> 00:57:46.284 align:middle line:90%
Where do they find you?

00:57:46.284 --> 00:57:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>> PH: On two
websites, www.paola,

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I spell my name
P a o l a Harris,

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:58.621 align:middle line:84%
www.paolaharris.com or I do
conferences and I am doing one

00:57:58.621 --> 00:58:05.094 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago on the O'Hare
case on May, from 2 to 4,

00:58:05.094 --> 00:58:11.465 align:middle line:84%
2nd to the 4th in 2014,
www.starworks.com So I really

00:58:11.465 --> 00:58:16.511 align:middle line:84%
believe in dialog so that's why
I'm supporting that conference

00:58:16.511 --> 00:58:17.315 align:middle line:90%
in 2014.

00:58:17.315 --> 00:58:19.982 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Well, good for you Paola,
I mean we need more journalists

00:58:19.982 --> 00:58:22.085 align:middle line:84%
like you in this
field to investigate,

00:58:22.085 --> 00:58:25.396 align:middle line:84%
to probe and try to get some
answers to the mysteries that

00:58:25.396 --> 00:58:29.147 align:middle line:84%
we're always trying to see
and find out and you do just

00:58:29.147 --> 00:58:30.762 align:middle line:90%
a wonderful job doing that.

00:58:30.762 --> 00:58:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> PH: Thank you.

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:35.667 align:middle line:84%
>> GN: Let's hear it Paola
Harris, on Beyond Belief.

00:58:35.667 --> 00:58:38.936 align:middle line:84%
And keep watching Beyond Belief
for more fascinating guests.

00:58:38.936 --> 00:58:45.692 align:middle line:90%
