so-called open channeling,

enter this reality like that?

You are the one actually--
the projecting into the matrix

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:10%
Marina Jacobi with us, an
author and ET channeler,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:10%
who has connected
with many races

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:10%
and channeled complex
scientific teachings.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Marina, welcome to the program.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Thank you so
much for having me again.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.833 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you channel,
how do you do that?

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:10%
>>JACOBI: Your resonance
of your biofuel

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:10%
becomes coherent
in one structure

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:10%
with another frequency
and becomes one unit

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:10%
and you are able to
download information

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:10%
above the structure
of the resonance

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:10%
that you are vibrating on.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you train yourself,
or did this gift just happen?

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:10%
>>JACOBI: Well, I had gifts,
like a child, of lucid dreaming

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:10%
and I've learned
automatic writing.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And then when I connected
with the hybrids,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
they were the first one that
connected with me, 2010.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:84%
They taught me telepathic,
how to do telepathic.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
practicing, it

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
tenses by itself over and
over and becomes like a--

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I have a so-called
open channeling,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.600 align:middle line:84%
that I can listen and talk
and, at the same time,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:84%
couple of different
vibrational sequences

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.747 align:middle line:84%
verging into talking
to you, for example.

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you were small and
this was beginning to happen,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:90%
did it scare you?

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: No, actually,
I wanted to write

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:90%
a book about extraterrestrials.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I was very eager to
know more about it.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.883 align:middle line:90%
No, never did, actually.

00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
We hear a lot, Marina, about the
word quantum, quantum reality.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.230 align:middle line:90%
What is that to you?

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Well,
I was taught from

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial groups
what is the quantum reality.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And they specifically taught
me how to combine consciousness

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:84%
with matter, how everything
is through frequency sound

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Three similar on-vibration
structures of sound waves

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:90%
combine together.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And they create a trinity
unit, becomes like a molecule

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:84%
vibration, and starting to
pulsate like a breathing

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
in and out, and
expanding and collapsing.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And that creates a reality
based on the magnetic

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and the gravitational field
within the quantum matrix

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:90%
latitude, altitude.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.453 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people use
this in their day-to-day life?

00:03:10.453 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: They you
use it because if you

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
know the alchemy of the
metaphysics of everything

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
around you, you are
the one actually,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
the projecting into the matrix
from your frequency of emotion,

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.930 align:middle line:84%
thoughts, and actions, creates
magnetic and gravitational

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:84%
field, becomes a laser
potent frequency,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and immediately from
you, goes into the field

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.735 align:middle line:84%
and creates matter
structures, realities.

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know
some people who can

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:90%
enter this reality like that?

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: We all
do, not knowingly.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.783 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of us
does, not knowingly.

00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the dream state?

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:90%
In what form?

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Even now,
every moment when

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:84%
you put a thought
and emotion, creates

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
magnetic and
gravitational field.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:84%
You project that within
your matrix from within.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And the next moment, you
create a new matrix of reality.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
You shift your
consciousness into,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and you create another
matter structure.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:84%
But you're also reprinting
everybody in it.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
at me right now,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
you projected that
frequency within your field

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and reflect as you, as
another version of you,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:84%
so you can have a reality that
what you experienced right now.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a science,
Marina, behind this?

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, I teach quantum
manifestation protocols

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:90%
based on exactly science.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Everything is based on science.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.065 align:middle line:84%
And that was from the
extraterrestrials.

00:04:29.065 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what they taught me.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it like physics?

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: It's like physics.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't think
of it as physics

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't study
physics from the planet Earth.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I was taught in a different
way to download physics

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
from above structure,
above the planet.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
your ET channeling.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: I was in my home.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing, as usual,
the automatic writing.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I had a picture

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:90%
that looked like the Greys.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And they told me,
we are the Hybrids.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Hello, Marina, we
are the Hybrids.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And be careful what you're
thinking because every thought

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:84%
that you have becomes like
a hologram in front of us.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:90%
We can see it.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
the journey started

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
when they start teaching
me how the reality combines

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.370 align:middle line:84%
with each other; how it
merges; what do you do;

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that your emotion,
thoughts, and actions create

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:84%
matter structure; how you
shift from reality to reality.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:90%
What is reality?

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:90%
What is a fractal reality?

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:90%
What is a timeline?

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:90%
What is reality?

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Reality
is the combination

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
of all the structures that
you project within the now.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And you combine it in magnetic
and gravitational field.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you shift
in moment to moment.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Each moment you shift,
you shift to a new Earth,

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and a new Earth, and a
new Earth infinitely.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And the continuity of that
creates a parallel structure

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got some
pictures we'd like to discuss.

00:05:56.065 --> 00:05:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Mm-hmm, yes.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look at our
first one here, Marina.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell us
what we're looking at.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:10%
>>JACOBI: That was given
from one of my guides

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:10%
from the Council of Nine.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.680 align:middle line:10%
I'm connected with the Council
of Nine and the Pleiadians.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:10%
And they explained to
me how each sound wave,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.700 align:middle line:10%
the way you see it, the
frequency 1, frequency 2,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:10%
frequency 3 Hertz
combines with each other.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And then below, you
see how it becomes

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.380 align:middle line:90%
a full structure of molecule.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:10%
And it's created by this trinity
structure by the frequency.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.582 align:middle line:10%
When this is combined, actually
based on the latitude, altitude

00:06:32.582 --> 00:06:34.040 align:middle line:10%
where you are in
the quantum field,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:10%
you can create, for example,
the version of yourself.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And that version of yourself
starting to pulsate.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:10%
And when it's pulsating, when
you see the little person

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:10%
there, that's starting to
pulsate as a version of you.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:10%
And when is the pulsation
happens, actually

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.810 align:middle line:10%
splits and reprints for itself
to infinite of probabilities.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are they
in that bubble type?

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:10%
>>JACOBI: Because it creates
this molecule, at in the center

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:10%
you have the black hole, the
way you see in the center.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:10%
And from there, you actually
shift in the realities.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:10%
It's actually the
neutrality, the zero point,

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.413 align:middle line:10%
where from one structure
you teleport to another.

00:07:13.413 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at the next picture,

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and you can tell
us what this is.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: And this is actually
what reality really looks like.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.190 align:middle line:84%
When you really pull back, this
is what your matrix look like.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Is based on frequency,
sound, numbers.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.710 align:middle line:84%
This is in the quantum
field in your matrix.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:10%
But when you combine the
magnetic and gravitational

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:10%
field of these
numbers in geometry,

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:10%
becomes very potent geometry
magnetic and gravitational

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:10%
field, which actually,
it's a matter.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Even your chair right
now, everything looks

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
like that because
you can measure

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.090 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of the
vibration of the location.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the reality
of the matrix of what

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:90%
we are really looks like.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looks like a spaceship
in the background, doesn't it?

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: You can create a
spaceship in the background.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:84%
You can create
anything you wish to.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this all part of
the quantum reality again?

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, this all
part of the quantum reality.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
engulf themselves

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:90%
in this quantum reality?

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.100 align:middle line:90%
How do they get into it?

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Well, you
project everybody in it.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:84%
That one particle actually
expands to infinity.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And when expands to infinity,
in the fractal momentum,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.430 align:middle line:84%
you're reprinting
everybody in it.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So in actuality, is one particle
that reprints everybody in it.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So you projecting me,
and all your coworkers,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.620 align:middle line:84%
and everything you
see from within.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.465 align:middle line:90%
It's nobody outside of you.

00:08:39.465 --> 00:08:42.510 align:middle line:84%
You actually project from
within everybody in it.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are people
doing this on their own?

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, but nobody
taught them the real quantum

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:84%
You've been told that you
have to see it to believe it.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And what the
extraterrestrial taught me

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
create it to see it.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I teach.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do people use
this in their everyday life?

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, they do because
it's a very specific protocol

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.460 align:middle line:84%
of how you need to combine
your thoughts, emotions,

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and deeds to collapse the
probabilities of the shifting

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:90%
between realities.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do
something or if you

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.750 align:middle line:84%
don't want to do
something splits up

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.700 align:middle line:90%
into realities of probabilities.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And then which one you chose
to experience and act more on

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:84%
collapses and becomes a
reality of a matter for you.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you use it
in your day-to-day existence?

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Give us an example.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Well, for example,
you wish to marry somebody else,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:90%
somebody.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know how
this thing is going to go.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
If you decide to
marry the person,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:84%
the reality splits up and
becomes a completed timeline

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:90%
of outcome.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
with the reality

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't
marry to that person?

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So you have two
probabilities of a choice--

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:90%
to marry or not to marry.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: And if you
choose to marry and take

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
a physical action, the physical
action crystallizes that idea

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
from the matrix to become matter
and then becomes a reality

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
for you that you experience
in the matter structure.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But in quantum field,
the probability

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.630 align:middle line:84%
of reality that you didn't
marry also exists in the field

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:90%
and projected itself.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But you did not
experience in the matter

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't
take a physical action

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:90%
to become crystallization.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's why people like
me or somebody else that can

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
tune in into this
knowledge, they

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
can see what's going to happen
if you marry to this person

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:90%
or not marry to this person.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
They can go linearly into the
fractal momentum of expansion

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:90%
to see the outcome.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can see
the future, basically?

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Well, I
would say, the future

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:84%
is based on probabilities--
probabilities

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
by fluctuation between
those two choices.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you end up tuning
into more at this moment,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.720 align:middle line:84%
that's what I can
see as a probability.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
call parallel reality?

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Parallel
reality is based

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
on this frequency vibrations,
like a radio signal.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:84%
If you have, for example,
one of the parallel realities

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:90%
can vibrate in 3 Hertz.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the sound wave
of the vibration.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But then you can have
a parallel reality that

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.412 align:middle line:90%
is vibrating on a 5th Hertz.

00:11:21.412 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
the difference?

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: The difference
is the vibrational signals

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and sequences that they're
mutating and vibrating

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:90%
and collapsing with together.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:84%
That creates a
different structures

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.145 align:middle line:84%
of existence based on sound
waves and the vibration

00:11:36.145 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:90%
that they're holding.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Literally looks like a different
radio channel, so different TV

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.100 align:middle line:90%
channels.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Each TV channel has a different
life form, different sequences.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can tune in into that
if you know how to do so.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you
know how to do that.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Mm-hmm.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you can't
do it, what happens?

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: You cannot do
it, then you lock yourself

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
into a specific
matrix of reality.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
know how to mutate

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and how to control that
matrix, you are actually

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:90%
could be completely controlled.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And you will never
see the existence

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.345 align:middle line:90%
of the other platforms.

00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I believe we have
some more pictures to look at.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Mm-hmm,
yes, of course.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.932 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a
look at them, Marina,

00:12:14.932 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:90%
and see what we have here.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Oh, OK.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:10%
Here, we have the
2 Hertz represent

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:10%
a parallel timeline,
vibrational sequence.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you see the
first one, the first circle

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.430 align:middle line:10%
with the person, that is a
reality for itself in a matrix.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:10%
Once you have the thoughts,
the emotions, and the feelings,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:10%
becomes a frequency.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:10%
And you shift your consciousness
into the next picture

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:41.340 align:middle line:10%
of 2 Hertz.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:10%
Those two are completely
different parallel universes

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:10%
and realities.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:10%
But they're similar
on vibration.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.980 align:middle line:10%
So the next time you
have a emotion, thoughts,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:10%
and actions similar on
that thinking and thoughts,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:10%
you also shift now in the
third one in the 2 Hertz.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:04.080 align:middle line:10%
So each time, this is
parallel reality for itself,

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.060 align:middle line:10%
parallel Earth for itself.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:10%
But you have a parallel
timeline based on the frequency

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:10%
because it's the same sequence.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.540 align:middle line:10%
Once you learn how to do
the quantum manifestation,

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.410 align:middle line:10%
how to combine the frequency,
how to control that field,

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:10%
and realize that you
are the matrix itself,

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:10%
and you can control by your
emotion, thoughts, and actions,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:10%
you can start implementing
through the heart

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.890 align:middle line:10%
positive frequency.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:10%
And you can start collecting 5th
Hertz of dimensional sequence

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:10%
for 5th-dimensional structure.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:10%
And this is how you
shift in the emotion.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:10%
And you start experiencing new
realities and new realities

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:10%
and on and on and on.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, you'll
be able to accumulate

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
different frequencies
of vibrations.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And all that becomes parallel
universes, parallel timelines

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:90%
in a fractal momentum.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do the
little figurines represent?

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: That is you
in a fractal momentum.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Each time you shift, each
time you create a new Earth

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:90%
with another version of you.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And that new
version, you're also

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.000 align:middle line:90%
projecting everybody in it.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this like
time traveling, Marina?

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Bilocation,
time travelings.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.510 align:middle line:84%
There's also simulated
realities based on spacecrafts.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
You can go to different
galaxies, simulated realities.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These ET
contacts that you have,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.910 align:middle line:84%
are they constantly
in touch with you?

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Well, it's almost like
constantly talking in my head.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like you are
talking to somebody.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.414 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that, I
have constant connection.

00:14:36.414 --> 00:14:37.622 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it disrupt you?

00:14:37.622 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: No, became part of
me, I think almost like a double

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, do you
talk, and they communicate

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.090 align:middle line:90%
at the same time to you?

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes, like a thoughts.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.820 align:middle line:84%
It comes like a thoughts,
constant thoughts coming in.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you summon them up?

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.822 align:middle line:84%
Or do they just
appear in your head?

00:14:54.822 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: There
are different ways.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:90%
I can pull back--

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:84%
ask a question, pull back, and
listen, and then talk normally.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways that
I can tune in directly

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.713 align:middle line:84%
within the field and start
talking through them.

00:15:05.713 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And do they--

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: It's
like a knowingness.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --tell you what
planetary system they're from

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Well, the
truth is that they never

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:84%
discuss too much of
the planetary system

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and specific locations
because they want my material

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.000 align:middle line:84%
to be based on quantum
structures and physics

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.590 align:middle line:90%
because you can prove that.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot prove if somebody
claims what location and what

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:29.970 align:middle line:90%
ET is.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: And they
want that authenticity

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.890 align:middle line:84%
because they told me, and I'm
quoting, that "in the future,

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:84%
all of us will reach
certain level of vibration

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.870 align:middle line:90%
in our consciousness.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And each individual in
the fractal momentum

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:90%
will have their own contact.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
be the real proof."

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So they can winnow of
the people that are

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:90%
naturally true to the cause.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you channel ETs?

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that at will?

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, I
did this last time.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:57.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could you do one now?

00:15:57.615 --> 00:15:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Mm-hmm.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
You just ask a question, and
I tune in within the question.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, my
question to the ETs would be,

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
are you from this universe
or a different universe?

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: And the answer is,
we are from the field itself.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Each fields become
a fractal momentum.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And in that fractal momentum,
based on your frequency

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.630 align:middle line:84%
vibration, you project
a version of us

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
based on your belief
systems that interact

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.940 align:middle line:90%
with you the way you wish to.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
other universes?

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: There are
infinite universes

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.380 align:middle line:84%
within the field based on the
vibration of the belief system.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:90%
It's simply a perception.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But everything in
actuality is a stillness.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And from that
stillness, you actually

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.050 align:middle line:90%
create wherever you wish to go.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many different
ET races are there in,

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.610 align:middle line:84%
let's say, the universe
that planet Earth is in?

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: The word
of 300,000 comes

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:84%
to mind if you
talk into galactic.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:90%
We're talking not linear.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
parallel realities,

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
realities within the
realities that are

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:90%
coexisting at the same time.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:84%
The number is 300,000
from your point of view.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, how
is planet Earth looked

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:90%
at by other ET races?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.369 align:middle line:90%
What do they think of us?

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Primitive,
with all due respect.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.540 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of dogma and
prejudism and unjustice.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
However, you are moving
to the next level.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we get
to that next level?

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: You're already in.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:84%
You just experience
how you get there.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Remember, into the
quantum structure,

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:90%
everything already happened.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And yet you're
creating it to see it.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
positive future for mankind?

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Already is.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:90%
You're living into.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:84%
You just need to shift
your vibration of belief

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:90%
system of the perception.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so you are in
the field of it.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.310 align:middle line:84%
From that momentum,
you start acting on it.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So you create the
parallel timeline for it.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
danger for planet Earth?

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: From
perspective of fear,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.100 align:middle line:84%
of course, because
you will create based

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
on that frequency vibration
the reality of probability

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:90%
for you to experience the fear.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Which one do you
choose to experience?

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We constantly hear
the phrase "free will."

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle line:90%
Do we really have free will?

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes, you are.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:90%
You always have a free will.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:10%
However, if that
free will end up

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:10%
interrupting the natural process
of ascension of consciousness

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.110 align:middle line:10%
itself, it will be
stopped in its tracks.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness will preserve
itself to the ultimate.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could solve
a problem for planet Earth,

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.245 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: The heart.

00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:41.045 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain.

00:18:41.045 --> 00:18:42.378 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Getting to the heart--

00:18:42.378 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:84%
the heart has a specific
chambers of vibration.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Through your
compassion and love,

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:84%
you're going to shift the
frequency of your momentum

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.320 align:middle line:90%
in the now.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And that will shift
you and bilocate you

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.590 align:middle line:84%
into a parallel universe,
when you will see planet Earth

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:middle line:90%
is making in the new beginning.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the heart much
like a brain, where it

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.880 align:middle line:90%
has its own ability to think?

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes, indeed.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:84%
The heart collects the frequency
vibrations that you projected

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:84%
in a quantum field
in your matrix,

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
convert them in a
special chambers,

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and they become very
potent frequency.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.710 align:middle line:84%
That has the keys to open
portals and stargates.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do the ETs that we're
channeling right now ever give

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.327 align:middle line:10%
us misinformation on purpose?

00:19:30.327 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Depending who
you connecting with.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, in order
for you to be preserved

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:84%
as a consciousness,
misinformation

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:84%
will be given to some case in
order the person to be saved.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of platforms
in your planetary field

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:84%
that are wish to sustain the old
belief systems in the matrix.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in God?

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: God is a fractal
expression of who you are.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
You are a fractal expression
of God itself in the now.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:84%
You hold the power of the entire
structure of that frequency.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did we exist?

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:90%
How did we develop?

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: From the
frequency sound.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:90%
It's simply a sound of a ohm.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And that sound is created of
billions of sound frequencies

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:84%
within now creates
one potent frequency

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.230 align:middle line:84%
so potent on vibration
that emanates

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:84%
in ripples through the
structure of the quantum field,

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:84%
then builds back
into one momentum.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And that expands into reality
based on the magnetic field.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marina, UFO
investigator Paola Harris

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.483 align:middle line:84%
has a lot to say about
the existence of ETs.

00:20:38.483 --> 00:20:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLO HARRIS:
Let's get over it.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is there a
message for humanity?

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:10%
Based on everything
you have investigated,

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:10%
what do you think is happening?

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:90%
They're visiting us.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.570 align:middle line:90%
They're coming here.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:84%
They have been since the
beginning of mankind.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.573 align:middle line:90%
What's going on, Paola?

00:20:53.573 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
I'm not that wise,

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:84%
but I did talk to
Edgar Mitchell once.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I miss him.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I miss him, too.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Apollo 14 astronaut--

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Astronaut, yeah.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Walked on the moon.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.893 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You know
what he said to me?

00:21:03.893 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you think people
are ready for disclosure?

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.410 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, they can't get
along with each other.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to get along
with extraterrestrial races

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.780 align:middle line:84%
that look completely
different from them?

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to get along
with all these different types

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:90%
of races?

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know that
Clifford Stone

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
said there was 57
different species he

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:84%
was dealing with that
he had seen in a manual.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I mean, we
have exo-racism as it is.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.030 align:middle line:90%
The Reptilians are bad.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:90%
There's abductions.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:90%
The Nordics are good.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:90%
They're angels.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what we--

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Greys
do their thing.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I mean,
it's ridiculous

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:84%
how we have already made
a decision about something

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
we don't really know
that much about.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And so when Mitchell
told me, I felt sad

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.972 align:middle line:84%
because I think you
and I want to know.

00:21:52.972 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We want the answers.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.638 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, we
want the answers

00:21:55.638 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:90%
before we go to the other place.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like we want the
answers, but even the ETs,

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, want to give
us the answers right now.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And Jacques said
something very beautiful

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:90%
that I want to share with you.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, he
said, this phenomena

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:84%
is a teaching mechanism to show
us who we are as a species.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, every now and
then, we look up and wonder.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:90%
We see a UFO.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we-- because
he did when he was young.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And he says, we have
to open our minds.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And we have to think
outside the box.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And I love that because in the
end, there isn't a whole bunch

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.180 align:middle line:90%
you can do with a sighting.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
How many different ET
races are you dealing with?

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Three or four.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:84%
They come based on what the
information needs to be given.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're from
different planetary systems

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:90%
out there?

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: The Council
of Nine is above

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrial structure.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:84%
They oversee extraterrestrials
and the humans and the planets.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:84%
They can change bylaws
of whatever agreements.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.190 align:middle line:84%
They can change agreements
in the souls of--

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is sound so
important to all of this?

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Because it
creates a ripple effect

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.720 align:middle line:90%
within the quantum field.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:90%
It combines.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And when it combines,
based on the sequences,

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and the magnetic and
gravitational field

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:84%
contracts into
matter the way water

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.850 align:middle line:90%
has five states of matter.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How were the
pyramids built in the planet?

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: What I was told
is through levitation,

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:84%
through frequency sound
technology, sound wave

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.493 align:middle line:90%
technology, laser technology.

00:23:36.493 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Floating the
blocks, basically.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Floating--
something-- I see it right now.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.630 align:middle line:84%
It was floating but was floating
like this, almost bouncing,

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:90%
when they were doing it.

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Water was involved with that,
too, water sound, water.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Some water was underneath also.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:84%
The water was going
through the chambers.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Some laser, something
like that, was involved.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.920 align:middle line:90%
That's what I saw.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marina, let's look
at another one of our pictures

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And you can discuss it.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.350 align:middle line:90%
And is this your work?

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:10%
>>JACOBI: That is my work,
given from the Pleiadians.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:10%
It's called "The
Harmonic Reactor" book.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:10%
It's on my website.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:19.420 align:middle line:10%
And this is how they show
me the frequency and sound.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:10%
Into the quantum
structure, everything

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.740 align:middle line:10%
is created from
frequency and sounds.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.040 align:middle line:10%
And is explaining how,
for example, the sound

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.380 align:middle line:10%
works, how it's combined.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:10%
What is different frequencies
combining in the field?

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.910 align:middle line:10%
And this was actually showing
me how you can energize

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:10%
the water from 3 Hertz.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.880 align:middle line:10%
3 Hertz in a quantum
structure is actually

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.660 align:middle line:10%
cleaning every single frequency
that was given into your field.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:10%
So if you put 3 Hertz
of sound into the water,

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:10%
and you hold it for 20
minutes of duration,

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.100 align:middle line:10%
and then you drink
it, it's actually

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:02.320 align:middle line:10%
combining your biofield into
coherent with everything

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.520 align:middle line:10%
that is around you.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost like the
work of the late Dr. Emoto.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.515 align:middle line:90%
He hits water with sound waves.

00:25:08.515 --> 00:25:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, maybe
something similar, yeah.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:11.807 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But
different frequencies

00:25:11.807 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:90%
create different energies.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:84%
What if you create sound
waves against the human body?

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.210 align:middle line:90%
What would that do to it?

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: It could destroy it
and disseminate the molecules.

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or could
it make it better?

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Could make it better.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about their
5th-dimensional artificial

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:90%
intelligence about that.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you build
a weapon based on sound?

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, they already
have weapons based on sound.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And they can have weapons
that can completely

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:90%
destroy everything.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But what they taught me
is that you can actually

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.760 align:middle line:84%
build something completely
positive through frequency,

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.745 align:middle line:84%
and restructure cells, and build
the human body back to normal.

00:25:52.745 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at the next picture

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.290 align:middle line:90%
and see what we have here.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.960 align:middle line:10%
>>JACOBI: That is
actually examples

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.380 align:middle line:10%
of what different frequency
sound does into the quantum

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.180 align:middle line:10%
field.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:08.050 align:middle line:10%
And the way you see it, 4
Hertz collects all the centers

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:10.600 align:middle line:10%
of the power of the
frequency, whatever

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:10%
is around the field, and
the combination of them,

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:17.180 align:middle line:10%
how you can combine each
frequency, and what it does.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.270 align:middle line:10%
And actually, they give
you what the frequency

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.010 align:middle line:10%
does into the quantum field.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:10%
And when you have a
science and laboratory,

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.710 align:middle line:10%
they can actually
start practicing

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:10%
what different frequency
and combination

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:10%
and duration of sound wave can
do within the quantum field.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- actually,
this is actually

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.240 align:middle line:90%
the creation of matter.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you make
these sound waves

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.580 align:middle line:84%
with tuning forks
or instruments,

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:90%
musical instruments?

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.440 align:middle line:90%
What creates it?

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: You can do.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But that would be too
primitive if we're

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:49.690 align:middle line:90%
going to do technology.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Technology has to include
artificial intelligence

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:90%
of a positive structure.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:84%
That is not putting
robotics in your body,

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:84%
but can recognize the field
and rebuild your structure

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.330 align:middle line:90%
back to normal.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think we have two
more illustrations for us

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:04.630 align:middle line:90%
here, Marina.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the next one.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: This is
actually an explanation

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.285 align:middle line:84%
of how two parallel realities
exist at the same time.

00:27:13.285 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What city
is this, by the way?

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: I believe
so it's New York City.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.560 align:middle line:84%
This is how, actually,
in reality you

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:84%
have split-up of
the two timelines.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:84%
In one of them, you could
be married to one person.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.490 align:middle line:84%
In the other one, you
could not be married.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But you, into the field,
those two realities

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.370 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously running
at the same time.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
look at our last photograph.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:10%
>>JACOBI: And this is how you
create parallel Earths running

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.240 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:10%
From the one Earth,
you split up on two.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.910 align:middle line:10%
From the other two, you split
it in two, and more and more.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:10%
It's infinite of probability
of Earths at the same time.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:52.980 align:middle line:10%
That's how they exist
at the same time.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:10%
And if you know how to
mutate the quantum field,

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.540 align:middle line:10%
you can actually tune in and
look into each parallel reality

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.330 align:middle line:10%
Earth, what's really happening,
outcomes of realities.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are there
so many little planets?

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Because
each Earth splits up

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
on another one and
another one to infinite.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.780 align:middle line:84%
This actually can
go to infinite.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that help the
planet or hurt the planet?

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Will help the planet
based on the emotional thought.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.820 align:middle line:90%
You create that planet.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Is going to go by how
you vision that planet.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Is that positive planet
or negative planet?

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
You have a positive
or negative charge

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:90%
when you shift the vibration.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ufologist
Richard Dolan, Marina,

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.950 align:middle line:10%
has his own take on ETs.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:38.450 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOLAN:
Another discrepancy

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:43.257 align:middle line:10%
is that there are many, many
encounters, a shockingly

00:28:43.257 --> 00:28:44.840 align:middle line:10%
large number of
encounters, I believe,

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:10%
that people-- ordinary
people have with beings that

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:54.560 align:middle line:10%
are absolutely not
ordinary, and which

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.470 align:middle line:10%
lead me to probably
connect them with what we

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:10%
would call UFO/ET phenomenon.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So one such example would be
what some researchers might

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:90%
have called the Tall Whites.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I've run into a number of cases
personally from individuals

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.460 align:middle line:84%
who have encountered
beings that seem like this.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.170 align:middle line:84%
One perfect example
of this would

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:84%
be one I got from a retired
US Air Force colonel,

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.510 align:middle line:84%
a man who also has a PhD, and
a wonderful guy, sharp guy.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Did a lot of classified
work in his day

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and had a strong not
only interest in UFO/ET

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:84%
but had had some work to do with
it in his professional capacity

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:90%
in the Air Force.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But the story that he told
me was in a private capacity.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
incredible stuff.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.177 align:middle line:90%
I met with him and his wife.

00:29:37.177 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And they were both sitting down.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And they told me
of a time that they

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.100 align:middle line:90%
were in a Las Vegas Casino--

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:90%
this is in the 1990s--

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.360 align:middle line:84%
with a friend of theirs
who happened to be--

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:90%
they described as psychic.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So they were all good friends,
and they were in this casino.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe he said it
was the Wynn, which

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.187 align:middle line:90%
is a beautiful place.

00:29:56.187 --> 00:29:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Yeah, Steve Wynn's.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yes, they were
on the second floor,

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:00.590 align:middle line:90%
having a good time.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And the psychic friend
grabbed the colonel

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:84%
by the upper arm like
this and said, stop.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And she motioned to a shockingly
beautiful blonde woman

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:90%
maybe 20 feet away or so.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said, she's
not one of us.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:90%
She's not like us.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.717 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's Las
Vegas, and there are

00:30:18.717 --> 00:30:20.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of beautiful
people in Las Vegas.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Including
shockingly beautiful blondes.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's exactly right.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:84%
But something got the
attention of this woman.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.350 align:middle line:90%
She became scared, nervous.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And she and the man's wife
went down the escalator,

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.937 align:middle line:90%
actually, to get away.

00:30:31.937 --> 00:30:33.770 align:middle line:84%
The colonel stayed there
for a little while.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.062 align:middle line:90%
And he's looking at this woman.

00:30:35.062 --> 00:30:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And her back is
partly turned to him.

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:90%
And he's staring at her.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:90%
And she turns ever so slightly.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:45.897 align:middle line:84%
And then he said to me, that's
when I heard her in my mind.

00:30:45.897 --> 00:30:46.697 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, OK.

00:30:46.697 --> 00:30:48.114 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And she
sounded, he said,

00:30:48.114 --> 00:30:50.840 align:middle line:84%
almost like, I would think, like
a police officer on the beat,

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
saying something like,
nothing to see here.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Go about your business.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.095 align:middle line:90%
Just go on.

00:30:57.095 --> 00:30:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Interest--
telepathically.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.752 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, right, exactly.

00:30:58.752 --> 00:30:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So he was a
bit shocked by that.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:90%
He was a bit surprised.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.110 align:middle line:90%
He stayed there.

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And moments later, she was
joined by an equally beautiful

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:90%
blond man.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And both of them,
incidentally, were

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:84%
wearing incredibly
beautiful blue clothing.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.480 align:middle line:90%
He joins her.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:90%
They're obviously a pair.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.630 align:middle line:90%
They chat for a little while.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Or they're there.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:84%
He can't hear anything
at this point.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they begin walking
toward the escalator.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And he's thinking, perfect.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:24.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm right here.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to talk to them.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And he's getting his courage up.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.990 align:middle line:90%
He's a colonel-- tough guy.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: He's
nervous about this.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:32.903 align:middle line:90%
They're coming toward him.

00:31:32.903 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:90%
And then he says nothing.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.315 align:middle line:90%
They walk by him.

00:31:35.315 --> 00:31:36.440 align:middle line:90%
They go down the escalator.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.440 align:middle line:10%
He starts now following
them down the escalator,

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.360 align:middle line:10%
a few feet just behind them.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.282 align:middle line:84%
And he continues to hear
them conversing in the mind.

00:31:45.282 --> 00:31:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: They're not speaking.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:84%
He's hearing them, and the
conversation was something

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.070 align:middle line:90%
like, yes, he hears us.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no big deal.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.370 align:middle line:90%
He's nobody important.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.215 align:middle line:84%
We'll just go
about our business.

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:59.090 align:middle line:84%
They get down to the
bottom of the escalator,

00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:90%
and they walk off.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.430 align:middle line:90%
He stays there.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had the
ETs not communicate with you,

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.850 align:middle line:90%
they just simply disappeared?

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: They will tell
me, we're busy right now.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.410 align:middle line:90%
But that's rare.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.012 align:middle line:84%
Or they will tell me, we cannot
give you that information.

00:32:15.012 --> 00:32:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Have they done that?

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yeah,
they have done that.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.820 align:middle line:84%
I had people-- because
I have sometimes

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.270 align:middle line:84%
scientists come in and ask me
for information, to download

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.410 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And there were a couple of
times that they were asking me--

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.850 align:middle line:84%
somebody developed
this technology.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:29.708 align:middle line:90%
What is inside?

00:32:29.708 --> 00:32:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And they will not
give me the answer.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can they explain
for us the Big Bang Theory?

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: It's exactly what
I teach, the whole structure.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.570 align:middle line:84%
The Big Bang Theory is
expansion and collapsing.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how did
something start from nothing?

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: It's basically
you hear a sound.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And that sound combines
all that field.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And it collects all the
magnetic and gravitational field

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and becomes fractal
momentums of it,

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.110 align:middle line:84%
and starting to reprint
itself because it

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:02.970 align:middle line:90%
starts spinning itself.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Creates the molecule.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Then this molecule vibrates.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's so quickly that
vibrates, and when it vibrates,

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.630 align:middle line:90%
reprint itself.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And those two now
merging and start

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.610 align:middle line:84%
collecting with each other
and bump into each other.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:18.300 align:middle line:84%
In between those two, you merge
one reality and another reality

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:84%
together, it becomes
a third structure.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.210 align:middle line:84%
But that third structure ends
up like one structure again,

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and again vibrates, splits up
again, and again and again,

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:90%
infinite, infinite.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And each reality for itself
holds a reality of existence.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
use this knowledge

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.500 align:middle line:90%
to help your own life?

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, I teach quantum
manifestation based on--

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and I have examples
of manifestations.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.290 align:middle line:84%
If you put Marina Jacobi,
examples of manifestations,

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.140 align:middle line:84%
in season four I have
a lot of examples

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.020 align:middle line:84%
because they taught me to
manifest from ground zero,

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.610 align:middle line:90%
when I don't have anything.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And is actually
exactly the opposite

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.487 align:middle line:90%
that everybody is being taught.

00:33:57.487 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
your website, Marina,

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.750 align:middle line:84%
for people who want
to get a hold of you

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:02.790 align:middle line:90%
or look at more of your work?

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: My website is Marina
Jacobi, J-A-C-O-B-I, dot com.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And my YouTube channel
is The Harmonic Reactor.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Harmonic Reactor.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: Yes.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:15.977 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
books do you have now?

00:34:15.977 --> 00:34:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JACOBI: I have four.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's
your favorite one?

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.060 align:middle line:10%
>>JACOBI: I would say
"The Harmonic Reactor"

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:10%
because there is a
lot of information

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:middle line:10%
for advanced extraterrestrial
technologies,

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.480 align:middle line:10%
but also for healing.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's written in code.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So when scientists or
people are reading it,

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.969 align:middle line:84%
actually, every word creates
a sound wave vibration,

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:42.060 align:middle line:84%
sonic vibration, and activates
the person, plants a seed.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you start
tuning in more, you're

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.960 align:middle line:84%
downloading more
information for yourself.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.949 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you come across
this theory of the harmonics?

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: The Pleiadians
and the Council of Nine

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.900 align:middle line:84%
downloaded this
information to me.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.909 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why you?

00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: It was pre-chosen to
be me because I would complete

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.470 align:middle line:90%
the-- whatever I needed to do.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there was some
impending doom on the planet,

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:84%
an asteroid, let's say,
would be heading our way,

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.070 align:middle line:90%
would they tell you?

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Would they warn you?

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: It will
be parallel reality.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I was taught to think
of parallel reality

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:22.650 align:middle line:84%
because if somebody tells you,
oh, an asteroid is coming,

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.260 align:middle line:84%
or we are doomed, we're
not going to survive,

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.960 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about
specific vibrational sequence

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.250 align:middle line:90%
based on their belief system.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.930 align:middle line:90%
They're projecting that to you.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But you actually, if you
know the quantum structure,

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.668 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
say, wait a minute.

00:35:34.668 --> 00:35:35.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my own matrix.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.940 align:middle line:84%
That is your belief
system in your reality.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.780 align:middle line:90%
I can create my own.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you know how
to maneuver that,

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.900 align:middle line:84%
you believe that
planet Earth is safe.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what it
is, humanity makes it.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you stay on
that belief system,

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.550 align:middle line:84%
you will project the
frequency waveform.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And the next
momentum that you're

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.520 align:middle line:84%
going to shift
and create reality

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.050 align:middle line:84%
will be on your structure, not
in somebody else belief system.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you could make
that asteroid merely disappear?

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: It could be infinite
probabilities in the quantum

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.370 align:middle line:84%
field how this
asteroid can appear.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:84%
For you, it can never
come into fruition.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.730 align:middle line:90%
You will never see it.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody's going to say,
oh, my God, happen over there.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.420 align:middle line:90%
You never saw it.

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Or simply you saw it, but
nothing happened to you.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:21.390 align:middle line:84%
It could be infinite
probabilities of how you're

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.433 align:middle line:90%
going to experience that.

00:36:22.433 --> 00:36:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do this
with the power of your mind?

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Yes, thoughts,
minds, and emotion.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.330 align:middle line:10%
Action is necessary
to crystallize

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.120 align:middle line:10%
that magnetic and gravitational
field between your thoughts.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts become a
blueprint in the matrix,

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.410 align:middle line:90%
the way that picture we saw.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.900 align:middle line:10%
But when you include
the heart, the heart

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.090 align:middle line:10%
becomes the sound
waves and activates

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:46.020 align:middle line:10%
the thought matrix blueprint
and becomes to vibrate.

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the action through
consistency every day

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.320 align:middle line:90%
becomes crystallized.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.710 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes matter.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.087 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marina, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:36:58.087 --> 00:36:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JACOBI: Thank you
very much for having me.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.840 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's incredible
to have the power

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:10%
to create things around this
planet, to better the planet,

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.290 align:middle line:10%
to better yourself
through quantum harmonics.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
