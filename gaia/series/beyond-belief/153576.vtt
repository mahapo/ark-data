00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.350 align:middle line:10%
Our guest today, Bob Wood, PhD.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Wood is a physicist, worked
for McDonnell Douglas years

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:90%
ago--

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:84%
McDonnell Douglas, of
course, the aircraft company

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:90%
that was purchased by Boeing.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:90%
They were based in St. Louis.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Bob was always based
in the California area.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing career he
has had in the industry.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
But somehow along
the line, he decided

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:84%
to get involved in research
of extraterrestrials, UFOs,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:90%
secret documents.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
He's working now with
William Tompkins,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
who is a whistleblower
about these very subjects.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Bob, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT WOOD:
Thank you, George.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.804 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looking
forward to this.

00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:84%
How does a physicist go
from just pure physics,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:84%
working with McDonnell Douglas
corporation at the time,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
start investigating
government documents, UFOs,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:90%
and very strange anomalies?

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, that's
actually a two-part story.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:10%
It begins when my
father told me that if I

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.015 align:middle line:10%
wanted to be a
better engineer, I

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.365 align:middle line:10%
ought to get a PhD in physics.

00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:90%
So I went to Cornell.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was right.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: So I became then
an ordinary engineer

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:90%
at Douglas Aircraft Company.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And the first job that I had
was protecting the Nike Zeus

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.405 align:middle line:84%
missile against getting too
hot by putting Teflon on it.

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:39.205 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:01:39.205 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And the second job I
had was, in effect, managing

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
the independent research and
development program so that we

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:84%
could train our
scientists, engineers

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.690 align:middle line:84%
to speak well and write
well to get their scores

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
high so we could
get good indirect.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
The third job that I had was
the Ballistic Missile Defense

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Program.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And that resulted in
my having some access

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:90%
to top secret material.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:10%
And then the last one was to
work on the International Space

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:10%
Station, try to make it
cheaper, better, sooner,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:10%
or safer using
advanced technology.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.310 align:middle line:84%
But in the process,
just before I

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
started to work on
ballistic missile defense,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I was in a meeting
with some executives.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we don't
normally hear you, Dr. Wood.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Give your presentation, he said.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.572 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what you've been
doing that's been interesting.

00:02:25.572 --> 00:02:27.571 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you're
not going believe this,

00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
but the fact of
the matter is I've

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
read 50 books about
UFOs in the last year.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that's
uncertain in my mind

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
is whether we
figure out how they

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:84%
work before or after our
competitor, Lockheed.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
moment of silence.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the VPs
said, "what do you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
think it would take
to look into that?"

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And so the
net result was they

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.280 align:middle line:90%
authorized a little project.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:84%
We had about six
people working on it.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.388 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
year and a half, we

00:02:53.388 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:90%
spent a half million dollars.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.732 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Through
McDonnell Douglas?

00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:57.148 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Through
McDonnell Douglas.

00:02:57.148 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And we set up a
laboratory in a van

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and hired a guy who
knew the subject.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Was a researcher.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:90%
His name was Stan Friedman.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Know him well.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.255 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:07.629 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My first
radio interview

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
when I was 21 years
old, a long time ago.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Then we hired
detectives to interview people

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and we spun magnets
in a laboratory.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And the net result was
after a year and a half,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.170 align:middle line:90%
we knew exactly one thing.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is how fast we
were spending the money.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
But we had no idea how close
we were getting to the answer.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:90%
So we scrapped the project.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.022 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
company, rather than

00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
to tell the government what
we'd been doing with the money,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:90%
paid for it out of profits.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So the government never knew
about this little project,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
which in effect,
was unsuccessful.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So that was my first involvement
in the subject of UFOs.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.942 align:middle line:84%
And from then on, I
joined MUFON and all

00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:90%
the other UFO organizations--

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:84%
APRO-- and began to
get the literature.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At any time, were the
executives at McDonnell Douglas

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
a little concerned about this
kind of research or anything?

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.574 align:middle line:90%
Or were they in it 100%?

00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, they were in it.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
They wanted us to
keep it secret.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So we had a Douglas
private classification,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:90%
the equivalent of top secret.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.276 align:middle line:84%
And the word spread
we were doing

00:04:10.276 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:90%
a little project like this.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.988 align:middle line:84%
And some of the conventional
people pooh-poohed it and said,

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:90%
you're wasting your time.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out we
really were because we

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:90%
didn't learn anything.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:90%
Why couldn't you learn anything?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, because we didn't
have access to the craft.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the difference,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
is that when we were working on
this project in late 1968, '69,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
in my judgment, the real
people who had been recovering

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
crashed flying saucers had
been analyzing and figured out

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.865 align:middle line:90%
how they work.

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So when I was trying to
figure out how they worked,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
my guess is the government
had already figured that out.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're convinced they
had retrieved crashed saucers?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, yeah.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:90%
No question about it.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But the answer to
your question, how

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.850 align:middle line:84%
did I get involved
in authenticating

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
the documents and that sort
of thing, that was much later.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.619 align:middle line:90%
See, after I retired in 1993--

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never retire, Bob.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: [LAUGHS] I had
43 years with one company

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and I've had 25 years as
an author and a researcher.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But about a year after I
had left McDonnell Douglas,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Stan Friedman called me up.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Bob, he says, I
know you don't have anything

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:90%
to do because you're retired.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I've
got access to--

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I've got a fax of a document
that seems pretty interesting.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's a special
operations manual.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And are you interested
in authenticating it?

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, I am.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Washington,
where Don Berliner

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.290 align:middle line:84%
had this copy of the
special operations manual

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and made high quality
photographs of it,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:90%
and then replicated it.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.827 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
that I wound up

00:05:53.827 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
being pretty convinced
that it was authentic

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
because I talked to a guy who
was in the public printing

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.351 align:middle line:90%
office.

00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at it and he said,
well, based on the content,

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.359 align:middle line:90%
I'd say it's a hoax.

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Because of the title, it was
"Extraterrestrial Entities

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and Technology,
Recovery, and Disposal."

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:10%
Basically, it was
a summary of how

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.520 align:middle line:10%
we'd had a secret program,
Majestic 12, to recover

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:10%
the craft and what to do and how
to keep the public in the dark

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.471 align:middle line:10%
and where to send the
bodies and stuff like that.

00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it seem outrageous
when you were reading it?

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Well, it was exciting.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say outrageous
because I had already

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:84%
been convinced that they
were here and they were real,

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and there were probably a couple
of different kinds of them.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So I was in harmony with
the content of the document.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Figured that's
exactly what you would

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
want to do if you wanted to
keep the public in the dark.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:90%
So that was the beginning.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Then after that, Stan
Friedman called me again.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.642 align:middle line:84%
And he said he'd been
hearing from a guy

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Tim
Cooper, who said

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
he was getting lots of
documents from whistleblowers.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Was I interested in
going to interview him

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:90%
because I lived closer to him?

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:90%
He lived in Big Bear Lake.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:90%
And Stan lives in Canada.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Canada, yeah.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: So I said,
well, sure, Stan.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.369 align:middle line:84%
Your first suggestion
was interesting.

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's try the second one.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So I went and I visited
this guy, Tim Cooper,

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:84%
who showed me more and
more and more documents.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Wound up with 51 top secret
documents that he had received.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did you
authenticate most of them?

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.999 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it was hard
to authenticate any of them,

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:84%
actually, because they came
from various sources, maybe

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:84%
eight different sources,
that were making them.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And one source, he said,
guy showed up in a truck

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:90%
and had an armful of books.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
were unclassified,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
but they were just
material that clearly

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.817 align:middle line:84%
had been kept in
a vault somewhere

00:07:45.817 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and the guy wanted
to get rid of them.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were classified
and some of them were not.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If some of these
documents were fraudulent,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:90%
why would they be made?

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Who would make them
and leak them out

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.474 align:middle line:90%
into sources like Stan Friedman?

00:08:02.474 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I'd like to
answer that question

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:84%
by saying that I don't think
hardly any of these documents

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:90%
are fraudulent.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd say maybe a tenth
of a percent, though.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:84%
If I've got 51 top
secret documents,

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd say maybe one of them
is fraudulent or one of them

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.173 align:middle line:90%
might have--

00:08:19.173 --> 00:08:19.266 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:20.580 align:middle line:90%
So 50 would be authentic?

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking about
the stamps, the consistency

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:84%
with the other documents
of the same time era

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
that you can get
from the archives.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And in one case,
I have a document

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
where it's a carbon
copy, original carbon

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:90%
copy of a so-called burn memo.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And you can get, carbon
copy, you can do things

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:84%
like authenticating the
font selection and that sort

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.580 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I've hired a question
document examiner

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
to use the same techniques
you'd use in a court of law.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And I'm basically
satisfied that essentially all

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
of these documents that
came from Timothy Cooper

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:90%
are authentic.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.210 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that they're all true.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, I think that
the people who were involved

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.935 align:middle line:84%
put in special keys to let
them know who is leaking them.

00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:17.490 align:middle line:84%
In other words, put
in a special word

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
or mark to identify one
document from another.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:84%
William Tompkins, of
course, is a whistleblower.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.780 align:middle line:84%
He has talked about a
secret space program.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, he
did it on the Gaia TV

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.080 align:middle line:90%
show, "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM TOMPKINS:
It's '42, 1942.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:10%
The war is on.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:46.350 align:middle line:10%
Rico Botta, his hobby is
sending these Navy operatives

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:10%
into Germany.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:84%
They've been going
all over Germany

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're staggered
at what they found.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:84%
They found that
Hitler and the SS

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:84%
made an agreement with
reptilian extraterrestrials.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:10%
They found hundreds of different
types of advanced weapons being

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:10%
built. These included 60-foot
and 250-foot, 500-foot UFOs,

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:10%
round vehicles, OK, UFOs.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bob, is that real?

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I think it's real.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Bill Tompkins
and I met in 2009.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Because by then, I had kind of
a reputation of being a question

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:84%
document examiner and had
a reputation, apparently,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:90%
of some integrity.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd occasionally
get a phone call

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.760 align:middle line:84%
from people who want to
tell me their UFO story.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And normally, I'd
say, "hey, I'm not

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:84%
interested in what
you saw last night,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
but do you have any
documents that relate to it?"

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And I almost hung up on Bill
when he said he didn't really

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of documents.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.494 align:middle line:10%
But he did say he worked at
Douglas Aircraft Company.

00:10:56.494 --> 00:10:57.660 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, what time?

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Your ears popped up.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.926 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Yeah, that's right.

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:10%
And so it turned out
that he worked for a guy

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:10%
that I worked for, in
effect, Elmer Wheaton,

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.310 align:middle line:10%
was a VP of a group.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And Wolfgang Klemperer,
or called Klemp,

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.917 align:middle line:84%
was actually the boss
of my boss's boss.

00:11:13.917 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All legit people.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, right.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And he had copies of memos
to people that I knew.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And he claims that he was
involved in a secret think tank

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I had heard
about think tanks.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:10%
And later on, I realized
that when he told me a story,

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:10%
that apparently the secret
think tank that he was in

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.660 align:middle line:10%
was involved in
interacting with the Navy.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And Elmer Wheaton
and Klemperer were

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
the people who were
involved in this think tank.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, Elmer Wheaton
left to go to Lockheed.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.252 align:middle line:84%
Did he take some valuable
information with him?

00:11:55.252 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, we don't
know what he took,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:84%
but I do know that he
laughed in hindsight.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I would speculate that he
was the contact with the Navy

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:84%
program, and the Navy
wanted to continue it

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and Douglas Aircraft didn't
want to because I think

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:84%
their senior management
didn't know anything

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
about the level of secrecy
that they were involved in.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, there
was no question

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
but what Bill Tompkins
was genuine and real,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and had been where he
said he was at that time.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So I was interested in his
story and he told me, well,

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
he'd try to write
his autobiography.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
how is that going?

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that the
background on Bill

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:84%
is that when he
was a kid, he was

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:90%
very good at memorizing things.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And so he made little
sketches of the ships

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:84%
in Long Beach harbor,
San Pedro harbor,

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.377 align:middle line:90%
and made models of them.

00:12:52.377 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And those models were
in a department store.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Navy came by
and saw these models

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.030 align:middle line:84%
were classified because it
showed the radar locations.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.095 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
they are, right?

00:12:59.095 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.804 align:middle line:84%
So they got a hold of
him and encouraged him

00:13:03.804 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:90%
and kept track of him.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.239 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as he became 17 or
18 or whatever it was, bingo,

00:13:09.239 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:90%
he went through basic training.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:90%
He was assigned--

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They took him.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.944 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: --to San Diego.

00:13:13.944 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:10%
And after he'd been
there about a month,

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:10%
all of a sudden he
got a call to go

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:10%
be in a room with the
admiral, Rico Botta,

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the night, and
listened to stories from Navy

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:10%
spies who had spoken German and
were coming back from Germany.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So he did that for
about four years.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:90%
And his job was a career.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Basically, he was responsible
for taking the completed

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.434 align:middle line:84%
documents and deliver them
to other Navy installations,

00:13:42.434 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:90%
as well as the universities.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these documents
purported exactly what?

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.531 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Each one
was a separate one.

00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they were dealing
with extraterrestrials?

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.872 align:middle line:84%
The story, of course, is as you
say, well, it's beyond belief.

00:13:57.872 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is beyond belief.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what he
was hearing firsthand

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.730 align:middle line:84%
from these spies,
was that the Germans

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:84%
had made a deal with some
aliens in the '30s, late '30s.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they believed
that this was going on?

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.825 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Well, the admiral
didn't believe a word of it

00:14:16.825 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:10%
and neither did the spies.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.942 align:middle line:84%
They said, I can hardly believe
this, but this is what I saw.

00:14:21.942 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:90%
This is what I thought.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:90%
So they were all written up.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And he would deliver
these to various people.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the people
he delivered them to

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.070 align:middle line:84%
was a think tank at Douglas
Aircraft Company, which existed

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:90%
right after the Battle of LA.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And what he told
me was he thought--

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I can't prove this--
but he thought

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.530 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the Battle
of LA, where we shot down

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:84%
a couple of UFOs, I think
it's been concluded,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that after that, there was
information given to Donald W.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Douglas, who was in charge.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And they set up this
little think tank

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:04.450 align:middle line:90%
to deal with the issue of UFOs.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, Bill Tompkins
was, on one occasion,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:90%
at least--

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:84%
he's had several-- he
delivered these documents

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:90%
to that facility at Douglas.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And then later, 10 years
later when he came back

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:84%
to work at that
same think tank, he

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.639 align:middle line:84%
saw some of the same stuff he
had delivered 10 years before.

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Being developed?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that's the gist
of why his story is

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:31.167 align:middle line:84%
so exciting, and at
least up to that point

00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:90%
when he was at Douglas Aircraft.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.958 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's so
compelling, Bob,

00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that government
working in collusion with some

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of the companies and
corporations on some

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:84%
of these technologies
and documents

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and stuff, why would the
Nazis lose the war if they

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
had that kind of relationship
with extraterrestrials

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.860 align:middle line:84%
who are giving them
feedback and information?

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And then what does that
tell you about the ETs who

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.650 align:middle line:84%
would deal with the Nazis
and all the atrocities

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:90%
that they had done?

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, that's an
excellent question because most

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
people I talk to,
including my wife,

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
have great difficulty believing
me that the Nazis lost the war.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And actually the
part of the Nazis

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:84%
lost the war,
Hitler never really

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
had inside access to the
UFO programs in Antarctica.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:84%
They told him they had a safe
place for him to go in case

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:90%
he got captured.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But they were developing
400-passenger submarines,

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:84%
according to Bill, to
take the technology

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and everything relating to the
UFO technology to Antarctica.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.827 align:middle line:90%
And that was the Navy.

00:16:42.827 --> 00:16:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was the German
Navy, not the Nazi Navy.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.144 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:46.144 --> 00:16:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The German
Navy was really

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.120 align:middle line:84%
the ones who were in
charge of the program.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And they decided, whether or not
they liked the people or not,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:90%
as they got to escape.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: If they didn't like
them, then they didn't go.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
possess ETs that

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:84%
were supposed to be
benevolent to deal with people

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:11.120 align:middle line:84%
like the Nazis, who killed off
six million Jews and things

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.744 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't these ETs know, who
are we dealing with here?

00:17:14.744 --> 00:17:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, the one thing that
impressed me about Bill's story

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.959 align:middle line:84%
is it clearly, he said,
there were two kinds of ETs,

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:90%
the good guys and the bad guys.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.666 align:middle line:84%
And the Nordics
were the good guys

00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
and the Reptilians
were the bad guys.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they were the
ones dealing with the Nazis?

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The
Reptilians, ultimately,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:84%
were the ones the Nazis were
in best partnership with.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.211 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
that makes sense.

00:17:31.211 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Because the Reptilians'
goal and the Nazis' goal

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.680 align:middle line:90%
were analogous in a way.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Reptilians, according to Bill,
want to conquer other planets

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and induce slavery,
whereas the Nordics really

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:84%
want to make the
world a better place.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.921 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think
Bill Tompkins went public?

00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I think there's
two possibilities.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:84%
One is, I think he may
have been encouraged

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.550 align:middle line:90%
to go public by the Nordics.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
He sort of claims
that he still has

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:84%
occasional interaction,
psychically perhaps,

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:90%
with the Nordics.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But also, I think
the Navy League

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:84%
has a position that
is, in some ways,

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:84%
maybe more powerful
than the Navy.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:84%
My judgment is that
the people he's

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.820 align:middle line:84%
been dealing with
in the Navy League

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
have contacts that are
more powerful than what

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.130 align:middle line:90%
the normal Navy has.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Navy, yeah.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: For example, Bill
claims that the Navy has

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:90%
an annual meeting in San Diego.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And he goes to
this all the time.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:90%
And he signs up.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:84%
He's shown me his
badges for admission.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And he says when he goes
there, he sometimes, he

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:84%
gets into a top secret meeting
without people challenging him

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:45.550 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.966 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
somehow, he's been

00:18:46.966 --> 00:18:48.675 align:middle line:84%
approved to go into
the top secret stuff.

00:18:48.675 --> 00:18:50.007 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know how that works.

00:18:50.007 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
endorsed him already.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, somebody does.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think the
answer has two parts.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I think Nordics may
be encouraging him.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:90%
And I think that--

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still?

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: --and the
Navy League has.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.854 align:middle line:84%
And I think he,
personally, like me,

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:84%
believes that the whole
truth should come out.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:90%
My goal is to get the truth out.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.973 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I do what I do,
is I'm interested in the truth.

00:19:11.973 --> 00:19:14.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what it is.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At this
point, because you've

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:84%
been doing this
for so many years,

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:84%
what would you
conclude about what's

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
happening here in this
entire field of ufology?

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I was on the
MUFON board of directors

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:90%
for about 24 years.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.692 align:middle line:90%
And last year was my last year.

00:19:28.692 --> 00:19:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, I've got to get off
and do what I want to do.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.115 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:32.115 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me,
did I have an opinion?

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I think we ought

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to have a conference where we
focus on what the truth might

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.755 align:middle line:84%
be and forget focusing
on the lights in the sky.

00:19:42.755 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if there
are aliens here,

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
let's find out why they're
here, how many are there,

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:90%
or what do they want.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Are we-- should we be scared?

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And there were rumors that might
have been secret space program.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:84%
What I've concluded is
that without any doubt

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
in my mind, after we started
to get the parts in 1942,

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:84%
we began the process of
reverse engineering them.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And we were amazingly
more successful in that

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
than most people
think because we

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
had help from some of the
Nazis who really knew it--

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:84%
one guy, who helped build the
first one in 1924 in Germany.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Geez.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Who actually
came over on Paperclip

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and was assigned the
Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was with the Wernher
von Braun group, I guess,

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That's right.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the Paperclip group.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think we've
been vastly more

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:84%
successful in reverse
engineering them

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.400 align:middle line:90%
than most people realize.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that's consistent with
what Bill Tompkins said when he

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:90%
was in this think tank in 1954.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:10%
He was drawing sketches of one,
two kilometer-long cigars that

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:54.270 align:middle line:10%
were supposedly going
to be built by the Navy.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From alien technology?

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:90%
They figured out how it worked.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
really I think was remarkable

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
simple and simplistic,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:84%
is that Bill says
that the first craft

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to go into orbit using alien
technology was a submarine.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.362 align:middle line:84%
What they did is they took
out the nuclear power plant

00:21:15.362 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:84%
that they had and replaced it
with anti-gravitational power

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:90%
plant.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Closed it all
up, turned on the juice.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And off they went.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Off they went.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:90%
So that's what he says.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remarkable.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And I think
it's quite possible

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that they did that way before
the Air Force and the CIA

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and the other people ever got
their stuff going at Area 51.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No wonder
McDonnell Douglas

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
wanted to get to the
bottom of this stuff, huh?

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right, right.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's so much fun to
hear these direct statements

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and imagine there's some
possibility that they're

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:47.565 align:middle line:90%
exactly true.

00:21:47.565 --> 00:21:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you convinced
at this time, Bob,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that we have a secret
space program going on?

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh yeah, I am.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm more and more convinced
because of the fact

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.910 align:middle line:84%
that a recent book, two
books by Michael Salla,

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be highly
correlated with the work

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:90%
that I did--

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.980 align:middle line:84%
or the book that Bill
Tompkins published,

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:90%
"Selected by Extraterrestrials."

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And Bill said he
thought that he was

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
going to be the
first one to release

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
the story of the
secret space program

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
when he was on Gaia
TV with David Wilcock.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So when this other book
came out by Michael Salla,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I bought an extra copy,
just pushed the button.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.430 align:middle line:90%
He says, you know.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.610 align:middle line:90%
So I mailed it to him.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.345 align:middle line:90%
And he opened it up and read it.

00:22:34.345 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And he called me up a couple
of days later and said, wow.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720 align:middle line:90%
He says, this is amazing.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.303 align:middle line:84%
He says, because I
thought I was going

00:22:39.303 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
to be the first one to reveal
the secret space programs.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he
and Corey and David

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:90%
started comparing their notes.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:84%
The thing that intrigues
me is the claims

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that have been made
in books recently

00:22:55.890 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:84%
that we got to Mars with the
Russians in 1962 and 1964.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:90%
We had a successful base.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And the obvious question
that struggles in my mind

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:84%
is, well, how did we
bypass the CIA and the KGB

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and get that done?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Unless they are in
cahoots with us.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's one possibility
that the KGB and the CIA

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:22.080 align:middle line:84%
were able to just have their
counterintelligence people do

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.348 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With people
like Tompkins,

00:23:24.348 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:84%
who are known
whistleblowers, how

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.720 align:middle line:84%
are they allowed to do
that without something

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:90%
nefarious happening, let's say?

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: There are
some whistleblowers

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.920 align:middle line:90%
who do get stopped.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for instance,
Linda Moulton Howe

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:90%
was talking to anonymous.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And after she began
her conversations,

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:84%
in what, 1999 or so, she started
to get phone calls saying,

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.440 align:middle line:90%
don't do this.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Strange calls, that's
right, threatening calls.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, threatening calls.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it depends on
the person, the situation.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Bill Tompkins
claims that none

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.660 align:middle line:84%
of the data that
he ever delivered

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.600 align:middle line:84%
was classified or
stamped with a caveat.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
The Navy decided not to
stamp it, it was so secret.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So they just delivered
it, unclassified pages.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it's possible
that if you take the oath

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and go through the
process of being approved

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:20.640 align:middle line:84%
for a specific
program, that you are

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:84%
under greater
control and scrutiny,

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:25.080 align:middle line:84%
with respect to
leaking your story.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would
you say that based

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
on your career investigating
this, that this is absolutely

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
authentic, that we have had
crashed material we've reverse

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.390 align:middle line:84%
engineered, there may be
an ongoing relationship

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:42.992 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials, and
we're being visited today?

00:24:42.992 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, actually, you
had four parts in that comment.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] First, I
would say, yes, there's

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.539 align:middle line:84%
no question that we've
had crash retrievals.

00:24:50.539 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:10%
And my son, Ryan
Wood, actually wrote

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:10%
a book called "Majic Eyes
Only," identified 74 of them.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.899 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good book, by the way.

00:24:56.899 --> 00:24:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: With respect
to whether there

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:84%
have been successful
reverse engineering,

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I would say yes, for the reasons
of the various testimonies

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.290 align:middle line:90%
and witnesses that we've had.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:11.190 align:middle line:84%
With respect to whether or not
we have created a secret space

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:16.410 align:middle line:84%
program, that's a little
more beyond belief

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:84%
because there is a problem of
how many people would have been

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:21.330 align:middle line:90%
involved in building the stuff.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.962 align:middle line:84%
You must have had
1,000 or so people.

00:25:23.962 --> 00:25:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thousands of people.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.420 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, the argument's

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.470 align:middle line:84%
been made that the Manhattan
Project had 130,000 people

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and none of them leaked
the story effectively.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they were able
to keep it secret.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a process of
keeping secrets, actually.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the paper I'll be giving
at the upcoming MUFON meeting,

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:43.379 align:middle line:90%
is how do they keep it secret?

00:25:43.379 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not easy.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.545 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, that's right.

00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a
seven-step process.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.190 align:middle line:10%
First, you hide the money, using
your unacknowledged special

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:10%
access programs.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.521 align:middle line:84%
Second, you make it illegal
to be able to testify.

00:25:53.521 --> 00:25:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Act of 1978 comes in.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.720 align:middle line:84%
If you want to tell your story,
you have to go to a court

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.690 align:middle line:84%
where the proceedings
are secret.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, they compartmentalize
it so that what goes on here

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:84%
is separated from
what goes on there.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Then, they do some
pre-selection of whether or not

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.730 align:middle line:90%
they're going to clear you.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:84%
They ask your neighbors, what
kind of a person is this?

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So they make sure that
you're an honest person.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you get signed
up, you sign a document saying,

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I understand it'll be a $50,000
fine or 10 years in jail

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:90%
if I leak any of this.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.895 align:middle line:84%
And besides that, when people
sign up to this, as I did,

00:26:38.895 --> 00:26:40.530 align:middle line:90%
they have a loyalty.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.770 align:middle line:10%
Basically, they are totally
honest when they say,

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to tell anybody
what I've been working on.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.180 align:middle line:10%
And then finally, there is a
process of a series of threats.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.102 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:26:53.102 --> 00:26:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Goes all the way
down to assassination.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are men and
black threats or more than that?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.549 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, I
don't really have

00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:84%
any good information
about the authenticity

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:90%
of the men in black.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
But I think there are people
who are maybe less bizarre,

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:84%
who are straightforward guys
who give threats and try

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to convince people that it's
unwise to be a whistleblower.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our friend,
Stanton Friedman, of course,

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
has been working on leaked
documents, MJ-12 documents,

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and he spent a lot
of time doing that.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TOMPKINS: But Jamie got
a roll of film in the mail,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
on which were two sets of eight
negatives each, 35-millimeter--

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:40.700 align:middle line:84%
you remember film before
this digital world.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.230 align:middle line:84%
You got negatives and you
got to make prints and stuff

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.270 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And those pages had a
copy of a briefing report

00:27:52.130 --> 00:28:00.010 align:middle line:84%
for President-elect Eisenhower
about Operation Majestic 12.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And what it says in
there, seven pages,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
is that he was
going to be briefed

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:90%
before he became president.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:84%
It said in there that
President Truman established

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:84%
a group called Operation
Majestic 12, accountable only

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:19.110 align:middle line:84%
to the president, mind you, and
named the members of the group.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And it went over the
history of Kenneth Arnold's

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:26.165 align:middle line:84%
famous sighting, that Roswell
happened, bodies were found.

00:28:26.165 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were those documents
authentic, in your opinion,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:90%
MJ-12 documents?

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:84%
He was alluding to the
Eisenhower briefing

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.340 align:middle line:90%
document, the first famous one.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:39.839 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I have the original
of that in my possession.

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keep that close.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.740 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
they're authentic.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
There's some argument about
one of the crash locations

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.500 align:middle line:10%
But I think it's
possible that it

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:10%
could be 99% authentic with
an occasional word different

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:10%
so they can figure out
where the leak came from.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:04.145 align:middle line:10%
Furthermore, Timothy Good had,
I think, a slightly different

00:29:04.145 --> 00:29:04.945 align:middle line:10%
copy.

00:29:04.945 --> 00:29:06.320 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing
that puzzled me.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I never figured that out,
how he got a different copy

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.860 align:middle line:90%
than the one that--

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.818 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That Stan had.

00:29:10.818 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That Stan had, yeah.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:18.070 align:middle line:84%
But that's a beautiful example
of the process of leaking.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And the other one, of course,
is special operations manual,

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:23.210 align:middle line:84%
where the leaker
just photographed.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the leaker
trying to accomplish?

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, there's
two possibilities.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.360 align:middle line:84%
One possibility
is that they feel

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that the work that's being
done is unethical, somehow,

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.490 align:middle line:90%
and that the public should know.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.899 align:middle line:84%
And they just feel that
way for whatever reason.

00:29:40.899 --> 00:29:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They think
they're patriots.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.730 align:middle line:90%
They need to get it out.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The other
possibility is that the leaks

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:51.050 align:middle line:84%
are intentional so as
to keep our minds away

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:51.970 align:middle line:90%
from the real secrets.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It has occurred to me
that maybe these leaks that

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:84%
started in 1984 of
the Majestic program

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
were intended to keep us from
looking into the secret space

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.080 align:middle line:84%
program that was possibly being
built. Because in '84, you see,

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:84%
that's roughly when
Corey Goode was

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.520 align:middle line:84%
being trained to potentially
do a 20 and back.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the
thing that the people

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:20.090 align:middle line:84%
in charge of the program would
want to keep really secret.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So you could leak
some Majestic 12 stuff

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.640 align:middle line:90%
because that was history.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.465 align:middle line:84%
And we already have
all the craft we need.

00:30:28.465 --> 00:30:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are documents, Bob,
still being leaked, new ones?

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.184 align:middle line:90%
Or has that stopped?

00:30:34.184 --> 00:30:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, the
most recent leak

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.119 align:middle line:90%
was just a couple weeks ago.

00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do we have?

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, we have 48
pages, allegedly from--

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:84%
47, maybe-- allegedly
from the DIA,

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:84%
which is a series of briefings
approved by the president.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:57.050 align:middle line:84%
It's clearly a set of
four sets of documents

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.970 align:middle line:84%
from different times
in the Majestic 12.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Authenticity
questionable?

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, let me
answer that in a second.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:84%
The scope of this,
clearly, is designed

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.210 align:middle line:84%
to bring on a new person
into the MJ-12 program

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to explain to them
the background

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:90%
and history in multiple ways.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.590 align:middle line:84%
One of them is 10 pages of
summary of what one of the EBEs

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:27.750 align:middle line:84%
found, extrabiological
entities found and said.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:32.130 align:middle line:84%
The authenticity of the
document is questionable.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Several people in the
last couple of weeks

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.850 align:middle line:84%
have claimed that
it's not authentic

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:40.680 align:middle line:84%
because of the classification
markings and other things

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.970 align:middle line:90%
that I regard as trivial.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm in the process
of trying to make up my mind.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I've got an appointment to talk
to somebody next week who's

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.170 align:middle line:90%
a question document examiner.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you on the fence
or you just don't know yet?

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.154 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I'm on
the fence, but I'm

00:31:53.154 --> 00:31:54.779 align:middle line:90%
leaning towards authenticity.

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Because if you read the
words in these documents,

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.210 align:middle line:84%
there's new stuff that it
sits in a large discussion

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:04.400 align:middle line:84%
of the backgrounds of
the 12 original guys.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And in some of the
testimony of the interaction

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:84%
with this alien that they
recovered from Aztec crash--

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.470 align:middle line:90%
and the Aztec crash is new too--

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.170 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I think that the content
of this document,

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.890 align:middle line:84%
which has not been
analyzed, offers

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:84%
more than issues and
speculation on the authenticity

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.870 align:middle line:84%
than does the security
markings and stuff like that.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things, as I
read what the alien allegedly

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:84%
said for 11 months
of interviews--

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.740 align:middle line:84%
there were 10 pages
of what he said.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at one
of his paragraphs

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and there were two sentences
that were so exciting to me

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.930 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to quote them.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like to quote them--

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Please.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: --right now.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: All right.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.030 align:middle line:84%
"Knowledge is only
good when spread

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.030 align:middle line:84%
like seeds from which
wisdom might grow,

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and faith has purpose only when
it is not created of fear."

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:84%
The inference being
that religions

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that are based on fear
are not constructive.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.260 align:middle line:84%
The other quote I thought
was close to my goal

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:23.540 align:middle line:84%
is that, "Our god is change and
our religion is understanding.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.540 align:middle line:10%
Searching for truth is our
greatest social challenge

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.720 align:middle line:10%
and purpose."

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.386 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the ET
species saying what drives them.

00:33:31.386 --> 00:33:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a creed,
one of their creeds.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And so this is new stuff, in
the sense that I don't think any

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.270 align:middle line:90%
of this has ever been released.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the question
is, well, if this

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:44.330 align:middle line:84%
was a real interaction with an
alien for 11 months from Aztec,

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and they were really
asking what did he think,

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:53.060 align:middle line:84%
why not look at his answers and
ask whether they might apply?

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
case, he happened

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.976 align:middle line:84%
to say something
that appealed to me.

00:33:56.976 --> 00:33:58.100 align:middle line:90%
That's why I wrote it down.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Clifford
Stone, a whistleblower,

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
has had some work in the
area of crash retrievals.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.450 align:middle line:90%
And he's very good at that.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CLIFFORD STONE: Then,
I got up to the berm.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.141 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the
berm, I looked in.

00:34:14.141 --> 00:34:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked in,
it had a canopy on it.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
kidney-shaped hatch--

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:25.810 align:middle line:84%
for the better word-- that was
right up against the canopy,

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:90%
but opens to the side.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And halfway out was this
little creature, once again,

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.179 align:middle line:90%
typical gray.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell
you whether it was

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:39.949 align:middle line:84%
three foot, four
foot, five foot,

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:90%
but it was half out and half in.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell
that it was dead.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.556 align:middle line:84%
I started to say, excuse me,
I need an officer up here.

00:34:49.556 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:84%
And he says, just tell
us what you see, son.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying back
to them, you know what?

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.679 align:middle line:90%
You don't understand.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.740 align:middle line:90%
I need an officer up here.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And he said, just tell
us what you see, son.

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, it's not from this
world and you guys know that.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I said, why the
hell are we lying?

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:14.407 align:middle line:84%
Why are we telling people that
these things aren't happening?

00:35:14.407 --> 00:35:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why was he
so emotional, Bob?

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, I think
Clifford Stone's testimony,

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:22.780 align:middle line:84%
there is a perfect
example of what

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.460 align:middle line:84%
people want to say
when they've been

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.400 align:middle line:90%
involved in these recoveries.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember
which one that was,

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.197 align:middle line:84%
but it might have been the Aztec
crash, which is kind of new.

00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was shaken up.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:36.883 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
gotten that emotional

00:35:36.883 --> 00:35:38.090 align:middle line:90%
about this topic?

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that's one
of the things that,

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I guess, I've avoided, is
I've been approaching this

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.920 align:middle line:84%
in analytical point
of view all my life.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I've ever seen one and
never want to see one,

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.770 align:middle line:84%
based on the reports
that I get from those

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:54.820 align:middle line:90%
who've been abducted.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But it's intellectually
stimulating to me

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.130 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand the truth,
and to understand the processes

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:07.495 align:middle line:84%
whereby we are able
to keep these secrets.

00:36:07.495 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:84%
There's so many things that
you're covering on your show,

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:13.470 align:middle line:90%
"Beyond Belief."

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:18.300 align:middle line:84%
That's where I want to go, is
to understand the processes why

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:84%
whereby these genuine
secrets are kept

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and the things that
motivate people

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:84%
to do like Clifford Stone did
and try to tell his story.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will we get the
answers that you're looking for

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.070 align:middle line:90%
and that I'm looking for?

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: I think we will.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I think we're on the verge
of really understanding

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.120 align:middle line:84%
what's been going on
because we're uncovering

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.730 align:middle line:84%
the secret space program and
all the subtleties associated

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:43.660 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.500 align:middle line:84%
The key is how do
they keep it secret?

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
I think I haven't really

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.990 align:middle line:84%
emphasized enough is the control
that the mainstream media has

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:55.274 align:middle line:90%
and what the public hears.

00:36:55.274 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in one of the
documents that we had,

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.860 align:middle line:84%
the first annual
report, it said,

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.190 align:middle line:84%
the most important problem
would be to control the press.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.560 align:middle line:90%
And that was 1951.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And they took on that
challenge of the government

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:08.816 align:middle line:90%
controlling the press.

00:37:08.816 --> 00:37:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they did
a good job doing it.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:11.358 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And they've
done a beautiful job.

00:37:11.358 --> 00:37:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your
opinion, what do you

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:84%
think is actually going
on with these visitations,

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.870 align:middle line:84%
with what may be happening
from other planetary systems?

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:23.925 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
here on this planet?

00:37:23.925 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Well, I would say--

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I have to begin by saying that
I have concluded, tentatively,

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.070 align:middle line:84%
that there are quite a number
of different civilizations

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.832 align:middle line:84%
that are involved
that come and go.

00:37:34.832 --> 00:37:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And have been.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And have
been over the years.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.970 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that I think
is so important that I just

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:48.680 align:middle line:84%
realized, really accomplished,
is superluminal travel.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So we can go there, go 86 light
years or so in 45 minutes.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.790 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And so
that's why I think

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:06.480 align:middle line:84%
the T3B, that allegedly is one
of the interstellar transport

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.180 align:middle line:90%
systems, can do that.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:14.490 align:middle line:10%
So I think that if you
remove one assumption

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:17.250 align:middle line:10%
that all the scientists who've
been studying this problem

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:10%
have made, the
whole world changes.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:84%
That assumption is you
can't travel faster

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.370 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand
the physics

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:32.030 align:middle line:84%
behind that false assumption,
then you'll be able to do that.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
you'll be able to have

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:35.900 align:middle line:90%
an interaction with time.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think time travel and
space travel are interconnected.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.352 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
extraterrestrials our gods?

00:38:43.352 --> 00:38:46.010 align:middle line:90%


00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:51.890 align:middle line:84%
When you read the Bible and
it depicts things, Genesis,

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.550 align:middle line:84%
fallen angels, are we talking
about extraterrestrials

00:38:55.550 --> 00:39:01.720 align:middle line:84%
who seeded us, as Zecharia
Sitchin has said in his books?

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The answer
is, I don't know.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.960 align:middle line:10%
But I do believe that there
is excellent argument.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think Nick
Redfern just wrote

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:84%
a book that claims
that some of the manna

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.950 align:middle line:84%
might have been involved
with some of the gods.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's perfectly
plausible that some of the gods

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.640 align:middle line:90%
were extraterrestrials.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you are
convinced we're being visited?

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced
we're being visited

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.737 align:middle line:90%
by multiple civilizations.

00:39:29.737 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bob, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.130 align:middle line:90%
We appreciate it.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Bob Wood, physicist, devoted his
entire career after many years

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:41.800 align:middle line:84%
with McDonnell Douglas to
investigate documents, crash

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.590 align:middle line:84%
retrievals, and to
answer that question,

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.290 align:middle line:90%
are we alone in the universe?

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:50.290 align:middle line:10%
Well, as you just
heard, he's convinced

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:52.000 align:middle line:10%
that we are not alone.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to give
people the information.
