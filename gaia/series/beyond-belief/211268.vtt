soul travel through dreaming.

Fascinating subject, Samantha,
and welcome to the program.

00:00:34.277 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SAMANTHA FEY: Thank you.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to be here and
talk about dreams and everything

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.415 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.772 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in interpreting

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:90%
and exploring dreams?

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, it really for
me all started back in 2005.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.040 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I was married
to a police officer.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:10%
And I started having these
dreams just over and over

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.150 align:middle line:10%
and over for a
period of about two

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:10%
or three weeks where I saw just
a bullet impacting someone's

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:10%
neck.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.742 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, it was terrifying.

00:01:01.742 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:90%
I never saw a face.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I just saw the hand
coming over the neck.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, being
married to a police officer,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:90%
I thought this was trying to--

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That it was him.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Right, trying
to tell me something.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So I kept telling him to
wear his bulletproof vest

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.473 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, be very,
very vigilant and careful.

00:01:16.473 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:90%
But you know how police are.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:90%
They think they're invincible.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.337 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the dream
came true, and he was--

00:01:22.337 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yeah, he was shot
in the neck while trying

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:90%
to apprehend a criminal.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And he was in a coma
most of that summer.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:90%
It was-- but he made it.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But I remember sitting there
with my sisters and my friends,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and I had told them all
about this recurring

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:90%
dream I kept having.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:90%
And they said--

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.008 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Precognitive, right?

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:42.965 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, and
they said, you've

00:01:42.965 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
got to do something
with this Samantha.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
You've been having
precognitive, intuitive dream

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:90%
experiences your whole life.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:90%
And so I--

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: --started on this
path of really starting

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.180 align:middle line:84%
to pay attention to
my dreams and seeing

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:90%
where it can take me.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And then I started researching
it and listening to--

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I have a podcast,
and I ask listeners

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:90%
to submit their dreams.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And I started realizing that
something really magical

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:90%
is happening when we sleep.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:90%
We're not just always dreaming.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very powerful.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is the police
officer doing better?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, yes, he does
have an anoxic brain injury,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:90%
so there are some limitations.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.545 align:middle line:84%
But he is doing
much, much better.

00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, our prayers
go out to him, Samantha.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Thank you.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the dreamscape?

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I feel like
when we are sleeping,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.438 align:middle line:84%
some nights we just dream
because our body needs to rest

00:02:28.438 --> 00:02:29.355 align:middle line:90%
and our subconscious--

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: --needs to release some
things, fears and whatnot.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But I think that many
times when we sleep,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:84%
we do enter this dreamscape
where we can encounter

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:90%
loved ones on the other side.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:84%
We can maybe encounter our
spirit guides and angels.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:84%
We can get information on
problems we're seeking.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Rudolf Steiner
called the dreamscape

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
a third state of being
where actually something

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.220 align:middle line:90%
really mystical is happening.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens when
we generally dream, anyway?

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the
physical process is,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:90%
or is it a physical process?

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, I do think
it is a physical process.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's why some people
report sleep paralysis,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:84%
you know, where they wake
up but their body is--

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can't move.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: They can't move,
and it's so scary.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So our body is naturally going
to paralyze itself so that we

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:90%
don't act out our dreams.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think that many times,
when we have these dreams,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
our soul is leaving our
body so that we can have

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.883 align:middle line:90%
these wonderful experiences.

00:03:22.883 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us more
about soul travel.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, soul travel
is a form of astral travel,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
except astral travel is more
something that people do

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:90%
on purpose--

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:84%
you know, where
they'll meditate,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and they really work on it,
they take classes in it--

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.125 align:middle line:84%
whereas soul travel
is spontaneous--

00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It just happens.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.488 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: --astral travel.

00:03:39.488 --> 00:03:40.510 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and you find
yourself in sometimes what

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I call the other side
of this other dimension.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to get so
much information and insight

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:84%
on problems you're having,
or meeting up with someone

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
you've lost that you just
want to see one more time.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How powerful
is soul travel?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I think it can
be very, very powerful.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
You can use those
experiences to gain insight

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.260 align:middle line:84%
into challenges happening
in your life right now.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.030 align:middle line:90%
You can use it to heal grief.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
You can use it to--
people have reported

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.600 align:middle line:90%
having past life dreams.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:84%
There's-- Dr. Ian Stevenson
wrote about announcing dreams.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:84%
And he recorded them,
amazingly with detail,

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
of people who would announce to
either their mom-- future mom

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:84%
or dad in a dream that they
were going to come to Earth.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now a lucid
dream is knowing

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:90%
that you're in the dream?

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.397 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can actually
alter the dream--

00:04:30.397 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: While you're in it.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --while you're in it.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like you're
writing your own movie script,

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.480 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great tool,
especially for creative people

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
because you can use that
lucid dream to really get

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.880 align:middle line:84%
some wonderful ideas for a
project that you're working on.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think lucid dreaming
can happen on purpose.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
You can try to train your
brain through different methods

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:90%
to have a lucid dream.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
But any time that
you realize you're

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
awake and aware
in a dream, that's

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:90%
an aspect of lucid dreaming.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Or have you ever had a dream
where you're watching yourself

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:90%
as George doing something?

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I don't do that.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm always like here,
like I hold up my hand,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:90%
I can see my hand and stuff.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
My dreams are always
that perspective.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Right, OK,
well, that's great.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people have a dream
where they're that perspective

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're watching
themselves do whatever it

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:90%
is they're doing in the dream.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I almost
dream like real life.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Right.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.913 align:middle line:84%
So that's a sign
of high intellect.

00:05:27.913 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some dreams, I'm going
to have you interpret some

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:90%
of them as we get into this.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Did your-- do you
get any assistance

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:90%
from spirit guides or anything?

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, I think--

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I know I do, and I think
many of us do as well.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's something
that we can rely on.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious mind cannot
handle an unanswerable

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you fall asleep
with a problem you've

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:84%
been worried about
or thinking about,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
very often the answer will
come to you in a dream.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But I've had so many
dream experiences

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:84%
where there is a guide with me
and will help me and tell me

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:90%
what I'm supposed to be doing.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, I'll
have these dreams

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
where I'm encountering
a being, a human, who

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:90%
has just recently died.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're not aware
that they have died.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And my job is to be
the medium for them,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
to serve as a bridge
from here to there,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and let them realize
that they have passed on.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.088 align:middle line:84%
And I will always
have a guide with me

00:06:24.088 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
who's kind of telling
me a little bit

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.172 align:middle line:84%
about their background
and telling me

00:06:27.172 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
what to say so that I
can help them move on.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
historical psychiatrists,

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
like Sigmund Freud,
Carl Jung, what do

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.513 align:middle line:90%
they say about the dream state?

00:06:36.513 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, Sigmund
Freud and Carl Jung

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:90%
differed a little bit on that.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.408 align:middle line:90%
Carl Jung had--

00:06:40.408 --> 00:06:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They argued
about it, didn't they?

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yeah, yeah, Sigmund
Freud believed most dreams,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
or really, I guess, I
could say, all dreams,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
he believed were symbolic
representations, whereas Carl

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Jung was more willing to look at
dreams in a multi-layered way.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.740 align:middle line:84%
He always said that
everyone in your dream

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.240 align:middle line:90%
is a representation of yourself.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you're dreaming about
a boss yelling at you,

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:84%
well, what part of you is being
critical of yourself, right?

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
But he also, especially
in his later life,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
became much more free and
open to talk about some

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:90%
of his soul travel dreams.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
He believes he dreamt about
World War I before it happened.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:84%
He had a dream that he
wrote down in that book--

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: --that made him rethink
the afterlife because he dreamt

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:84%
about his father coming
to him and saying,

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, your mom's going
to be joining me soon.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My daughter
had a 911 dream--

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:90%
9/11 dream.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Wow.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Weeks
before it happened.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.380 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea what
it was except she

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:84%
called me up and said, dad, I
just had this strange dream.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this big city,
I don't know where,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and this cloud of dust
and dirt is falling on me.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And I look down at
my feet, and I'm

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.510 align:middle line:84%
in 6 inches deep of this stuff
all over the city, what is it?

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Wendy,
I have no idea.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:90%
9/11 hits.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Boom.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we see
the stuff falling--

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yep.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was--

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Just like her dream.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the studies
on the precognitive

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
dreams that happened
before 9/11 are

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:90%
fascinating to look through.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
statistics of those airplanes

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that those poor people were on,
they were about 20% capacity.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:84%
They weren't full planes
which leads one to wonder,

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
did some of them have
a precognitive dream

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that made them cancel
their flight that day?

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.422 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some people did.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Right, so I think
that's interesting.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a doctor in
England in the 1960s.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:84%
He started the
Premonitions Bureau

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
after they had this
terrible coal mining

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:90%
landslide in South Wales.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:10%
And he started reading
newspaper reports

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.590 align:middle line:10%
where so many people had
dreamt of this horrible event

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.010 align:middle line:10%
happening weeks beforehand,
including some of the children.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:84%
The landslide happened
with the coal mine,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:90%
and it covered a school.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, a
lot of little children

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.290 align:middle line:90%
passed away as well.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:84%
But when they looked back
through the drawings,

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
many of the little children
had drawn just that.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So he actually started
this whole research project

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:84%
called the Premonitions Bureau
to research precognitive

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:90%
dreams.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
something that is giving us

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:84%
these intuitive dreams,
sending the information to us?

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: You know, I don't know.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
full answer to that.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
the remote viewing

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
program, the Stargate
Program, and you

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
look at all of
their findings, they

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that all
the information that we

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.580 align:middle line:90%
need to know is out there now.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:90%
It's available to all of us now.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can dip into that
collective consciousness

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
of all knowing
through meditation

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:90%
or through your dreams.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So it makes you think
is it always out there,

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and we just have to quiet
our brain to get there?

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Samantha,
at age 39, you

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:90%
had a bout with breast cancer.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, and it was--

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:90%
all was helped by a dream.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I had this really
powerful experience.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in my bed, but I
knew I was still dreaming.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And I heard this loud
bang in my living room.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I rushed out
to my living room.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And there was my mother-in-law
who had passed away

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:90%
five years before.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:90%
And I loved my mother-in-law.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And there she is
in my living room.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Maggie, what
are you doing in my dream?

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:10%
And she said,
Samantha, help me up,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:10%
that took more energy
than they told me.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:90%
I said, what took more energy?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And she said, breaking
into your dream.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Help me up, I don't
have much time.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:90%
So I helped her up.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: And she held
my hands, and she

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
said, listen to me, honey,
listen, it means nothing.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you hear me?

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It means nothing.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be OK.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're going,
what is she talking about?

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I had no idea what
she was talking about.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and tell
Grace congratulations.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And Grace was her grandchild
from my sister-in-law's side

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:90%
of the family.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So I woke up and I told my
husband, Mike, at the time.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.645 align:middle line:84%
I said, I just had this
dream about your mom.

00:10:50.645 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it means.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.577 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
let me call my sister

00:10:53.577 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and see if anything
happened to Grace.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:84%
If nothing happened to Grace,
then it was just a dream.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: So he calls
up his sister,

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and her daughter, Grace,
had just made the ski team.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And so then I thought, uh-oh,
what is she trying to tell me.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And later that night, I
found a lump in my breast.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, no.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: And so I did go and find
out that I had breast cancer.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But luckily, I
caught it in time.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:90%
And Maggie was absolutely right.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:90%
I was fine.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I got through it, and
it didn't mean nothing,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.240 align:middle line:90%
It definitely meant something.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.050 align:middle line:84%
But I got through it, flying
colors, perfect health.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had you not
had that dream about it,

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.647 align:middle line:84%
and the years
would have gone by,

00:11:32.647 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:84%
it could have been
a disaster for you.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: It could have
been a disaster.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.843 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
spent that process,

00:11:38.843 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:84%
going through all
those, you know,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:84%
the doctor's appointments,
and the waiting,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and let's get this
test and this,

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I would have spent that
process in a mess of nerves.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But I kept hearing her voice
from that dream in my head.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:90%
It means nothing.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.090 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be OK.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your father
had Alzheimer's.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.167 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about that.

00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, so my dad
was just an amazing man.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.847 align:middle line:90%
He just passed away in May.

00:12:00.847 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sorry to hear that.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Oh, that's all right.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:84%
He was in advertising
and just very creative

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and a true intellectual.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.270 align:middle line:84%
So to watch him leave us
in those steps and stages

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:90%
was really hard.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.308 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, of course,

00:12:13.308 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: And we couldn't have
conversations with him.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:84%
He could say one word towards
the end of his life, which

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.400 align:middle line:90%
was wonderful.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So we had this moment
together, he and I,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of perfect lucidity
where he was able to talk

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to me about this phenomenon
that was happening to him.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, on a
nightly basis, where

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:84%
he dreams and he goes
to the other side

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:90%
and he sees his father.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:90%
And he says, I'm there as well.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And we're helping him to
get ready to cross over

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:90%
to the other side.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was just amazing
because we never

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:90%
had that lucidity after that.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you recorded him.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes, I recorded that.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have it.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.135 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Oh, let's hear it.

00:12:53.135 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DAD: I go up, up in
the air around 6 o'clock.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:90%
I've got two places.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:90%
It will happen, but not today.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Not today.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
What's the other
place look like?

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.660 align:middle line:90%
You say, you live in two places.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.960 align:middle line:84%
What's your other
place look like?

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DAD: No one hurts me.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:90%
They feel something about me.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting-- I'm
getting very close.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: You're
getting very close?

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.756 align:middle line:90%
>>DAD: Yeah, I've got two of me.

00:13:32.756 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Two of, two Me's.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Soul goes out, goes out.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: You'll stay here, and
then your soul will go there?

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DAD: Yeah, I don't know
what to do or anything.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: They haven't told you?

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.733 align:middle line:84%
>>DAD: No, I get it
when I'm sleeping.

00:13:48.733 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: When you're sleeping.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DAD: Sleeping.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:14:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DAD: After 8:00 or so,
maybe 9:00, I go to sleep.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
bang, I'm there.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: You're there.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DAD: Yeah.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DAD: This whole place,
at night, there's you.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Me?

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm there?

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DAD: Yeah, and my father.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:90%
He said you're going over there.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:90%
What time is it?

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Almost 5 o'clock.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>DAD: 5 o'clock?

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:90%
So, that's when it starts.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.163 align:middle line:90%
And he told me.

00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: What did he tell you?

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.010 align:middle line:10%
>>DAD: He'll take everything off
of me, everything, all of this,

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:10%
and put me in over
there some place.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:90%
I just went to him.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: You went to him?

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.495 align:middle line:90%
And what did he say?

00:14:53.495 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DAD: I have a
great place for you.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about things.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Good.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DAD: Yeah.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for me
to walk and talk.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I asked my father, why
are you doing this?

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DAD: Yeah.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: What did he say?

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DAD: Be nice to the people,
and don't worry when it comes.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
subtitles helped a lot.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, definitely does.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.582 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does that make you
feel when you hear him again?

00:15:38.582 --> 00:15:41.320 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Well, it makes me feel
emotional but also just so

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:10%
happy because he was
almost having his life

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.070 align:middle line:10%
review before he passed away.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And that recording is actually
about 45 minutes long.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I mean, he just
wanted to keep talking

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:90%
about this the whole afternoon.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And I just find it very,
very comforting because he

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
would say that, at night,
he would see a staircase.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And I would be at the bottom,
and his dad and his dog,

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Slugger, would be at the top.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And I had to ask my cousins,
I'm like, who's Slugger?

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was his childhood dog.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And you know how Alzheimer's
is, I thought it was amazing

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.697 align:middle line:90%
that he recalled that name.

00:16:18.697 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, they're trying to
get him to go up the staircase.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle line:90%
But he isn't ready.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Other than speaking
softly, he sounded pretty--

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.733 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --together.

00:16:26.733 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, and it was like
this little magical window

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.650 align:middle line:84%
open for that day, you
know, and it closed.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so happy I
remembered to record it.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you had dreams
about him since he passed?

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: No, I have not.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And it really bothers me.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that unusual?

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes, and no.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when
you pass from something

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
like Alzheimer's,
what I've been told

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and what I've heard
from other people

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:84%
is it takes a long time for them
to acclimate to the other side.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:84%
My youngest daughter is way
more intuitive than I am.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And about a month after
my dad passed away,

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.480 align:middle line:90%
my daughter had a dream.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said, she was
flying with her angel.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And she saw all these what
she described as clouds

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:84%
with these lights
waving over the clouds.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:90%
And in each cloud was a person.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:90%
And they're flying over.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And she sees her grandfather.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:90%
She called him papa.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And she says to her
angel, that's my papa,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:90%
I have to say hi to him.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And the angel said, no, you
can't, he's still healing.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think very often
when we cross over,

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:84%
our mind has been so muddled,
either from Alzheimer's, or

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:84%
dementia, or maybe
a coma, I think,

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:90%
it takes them a while to--

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do you
think, Samantha,

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:90%
generates the visitation?

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Us to the dying,
or the dying to us?

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I think, generally, it's
the dying who generate that.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
have to do that.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And what I've been told in
many of these dream experiences

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I've had with my
guides, they have

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
to be given permission
to come in our dreams.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Because think about
it, if they were

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:84%
able to come into our
dreams any time they wanted,

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
it would hinder our grief
process, our ability

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:90%
to move forward.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And it might hinder them
too because they miss us

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:90%
just as much as we miss them.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the past
four years, I've

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.300 align:middle line:90%
had three close friends die.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not one has visited
me in my dream state,

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'm beginning
to, like you, wonder

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.193 align:middle line:90%
what's taking them so long.

00:18:19.193 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, where are they?

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.815 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But do we
really need that anyway?

00:18:22.815 --> 00:18:23.615 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Well--

00:18:23.615 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A visitation.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.992 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I do think that
sometimes we don't, especially,

00:18:27.992 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:84%
if you have the belief and
the faith that they're OK,

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:90%
you don't.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.272 align:middle line:90%
But I still think it's nice.

00:18:32.272 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I love that book
"Postcards from Heaven".

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:90%
I just love the title.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.125 align:middle line:90%
Just give us a postcard.

00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: A little dream
that just says--

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little sign.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: --I made it,
I'm here, I'm OK.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let us
know you made it.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yeah, sometimes, they
can't come in our dreams

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:84%
because we're so grieving
that it kind of puts up

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:90%
walls and barriers.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And they can't enter
our dream state.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So I always tell people,
tell your loved one

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, you have
permission to come in a dream

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:84%
to a friend, or a family member,
who's not grieving as much.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I have a story in the book of
a dream where a neighbor was

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
walking by and said tell my
wife that Tweety said hello.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
recounted the dream,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:84%
it turned out that it was
just a neighbor I didn't know

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
very well, but it
turned out that that

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:90%
was his nickname for her.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to come to
me in a dream but not to her

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.460 align:middle line:84%
because she was so
actively grieving.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you told
her this, was she freaking?

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: A little bit but
not-- but not as much.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I think the little nickname
that no one really knew

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:90%
that he called her, I guess--

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
sign right there.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yeah, yeah, she said
that she did talk a lot

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.390 align:middle line:84%
so that's why he
called her that.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.682 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is there an afterlife?

00:19:39.682 --> 00:19:40.765 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: I believe there is.

00:19:40.765 --> 00:19:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe I haven't
been visited because maybe

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.277 align:middle line:90%
there isn't any.

00:19:44.277 --> 00:19:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, I mean,
that could be it.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:90%
It could all be here right now.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But I, in my heart, I
believe that there is, I do.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You hope there
is or you know there is?

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I don't think we know
anything until we get there.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think if you
look at the phenomenon

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:84%
of near-death
experiences, or you

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.380 align:middle line:84%
look at just some of the
amazing research that's

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.320 align:middle line:84%
been done into these
soul travel dreams,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be
something out there.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
night worker, Samantha?

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, a night worker
is someone who works during

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:84%
the day as a light worker,
so you might be a healer,

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
or an intuitive, or just
genuinely working to be kinder

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and bring some
goodness to the world--

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An active, alive human.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, yes, and
a lot of those people

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:84%
have these experiences
when they're

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:84%
sleeping of doing what I
call night work where they're

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.200 align:middle line:84%
offering healings to other
people living or deceased,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.420 align:middle line:84%
or they're helping
cross over a ghost,

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:84%
or they're helping
people do a life review.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So I've had wonderful
dream experiences.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream where we were
in this like movie theater.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And we were all sitting
around this man named Oliver.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And I knew in the dream
that he was contemplating

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:53.960 align:middle line:90%
taking his own life.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, jeez.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: And I knew he--

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he a real person?

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:90%
And I knew he was alive.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:90%
And there was a movie screen.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were showing
images of his life.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:10%
And there were two angels
around him on each side,

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.630 align:middle line:10%
and then us humans
were standing behind.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:10%
And Oliver kept saying,
Oh, I didn't know--

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:10%
I forgot I did that, or I didn't
know that lovely gesture I did

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:10%
meant so much to that person.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it was as though the
angels, and I guess us as well,

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.040 align:middle line:84%
these humans that
were in the dream

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.690 align:middle line:84%
were trying to
tell him your life

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:84%
is so important and
worthwhile and stay here.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that's part of being
a night worker where you're

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.540 align:middle line:84%
helping people who are here
on Earth to really understand

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that
they're doing good work

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:90%
and they have a purpose.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your dreams are
pretty vivid, aren't they?

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: They are,
not all the time.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And I do stress
that in the book.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
not going to have--

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I think they say on average
we have seven dreams a night.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.827 align:middle line:84%
And very few of us are
going to remember all seven.

00:21:45.827 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, if at all.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: If at all, and
a lot of those dreams

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:84%
are just going to be
those typical stress

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:84%
dreams of showing up late for
an exam, or what have you.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But I do think a small but
very significant and important

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.870 align:middle line:84%
percentage of those
dreams are giving us

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:90%
a glimpse into this afterlife.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
different types of dreams

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.250 align:middle line:90%
are there, Samantha?

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:90%
We know there's precognitive.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:90%
We know there's--

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.998 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: There's several.

00:22:07.998 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:90%
There's precognitive.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:09.888 align:middle line:90%
There's lucid dreaming.

00:22:09.888 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:90%
There's astral travel dreaming.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.280 align:middle line:90%
There's past life dreaming.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:90%
There's announcing dreaming.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:15.830 align:middle line:90%
There's--

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:16.663 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nightmares.

00:22:16.663 --> 00:22:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Nightmares, yes, which
are terrifying, obviously,

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:84%
but incredibly instructive
because nightmare dreams tell

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:90%
us what we're worried about.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So often, throughout our
day, we push down our fears.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
think about them.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:90%
We ignore our stresses.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:84%
We ignore what our inner
voice is trying to tell us.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And nightmares are
a really great way

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:41.693 align:middle line:84%
when we're asleep and relaxed
for our conscious to tell us,

00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:84%
hey, pay attention, this
is what you're really

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:90%
thinking and worrying about.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a
strange dream once.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I was expecting a package.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had to be home to
sign for it in real life.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm dreaming,
and I'm dreaming that I'm

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:90%
waiting for this package.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm asleep.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
the doorbell rings,

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:90%
wakes me up from the dream.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a UPS guy with the package.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Now how in the world
does that happen?

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, that
just goes to show--

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:84%
I always teach people
what I teach about dreams.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you're doing or
thinking about during the day

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
reflected at night.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you're worried
about something

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:84%
like getting a
package, it's going

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:90%
to show up in your dreams.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But it could also be
more symbolic than that.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
trying to tell you

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
about something that you need
to pick up in your own life

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:90%
and sign for,

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.093 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a
numerologist on the radio

00:23:34.093 --> 00:23:35.340 align:middle line:90%
show, Glynis McCants.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Glynis
McCants, I love her.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.012 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's one of the best.

00:23:37.012 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Does numerology tie
into dreams at all?

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes, I think so.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
If you know a little
bit about numbers,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and you have any numbers
that show up in your dream,

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:84%
it can really tell
you more about what's

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:90%
going on in your life.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend, for
example, she was

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.588 align:middle line:84%
having a dream about
all these birds,

00:23:53.588 --> 00:23:55.630 align:middle line:84%
kind of like Alfred
Hitchcock, you know, flying--

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like "The Birds".

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: --over her.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and she said to this
person standing next to her,

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:90%
there must be hundreds of birds.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:90%
And the man was very stern.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, there are 23.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:90%
And at the time--

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just that.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Just that, very 23.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, she was
considering a relationship

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:90%
issue.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And so she called
me and she was like,

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I can't make sense
of this dream.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.462 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, the number 2
is about partnership and love,

00:24:19.462 --> 00:24:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and the number 3 is
about communication.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you put it
together, 2 plus 3

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:26.570 align:middle line:84%
is 5, that's the
number of change.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So I told her, I said,
I think that dream

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:84%
was trying to tell you
that you and your partner

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.330 align:middle line:84%
need to communicate
so that there

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.210 align:middle line:84%
can be a positive change
in this relationship.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So it can be really
interesting if you look at --

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
there's a house number in
your dream, or someone--

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:84%
there have been stories,
and I include some of them

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
in the book, of people who
have dreamt lottery numbers

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:90%
and then won the lottery.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: I know.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.830 align:middle line:84%
That has not happened to me,
but there are documented stories

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:90%
of that happening.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
don't remember their dreams?

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Quite a few don't
remember their dreams.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.555 align:middle line:90%
But most people--

00:25:00.555 --> 00:25:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And why not?

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:05.198 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, I think, for
the main part, it's stress.

00:25:05.198 --> 00:25:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
the amount of emails

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I got from people during
the COVID lockdowns who

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:84%
were telling me they were
not remembering their dreams.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
science behind that.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.950 align:middle line:84%
A lot of cortisol is
released when we sleep.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you're building up a
lot of cortisol in your day

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:84%
through stress, it's going
to inhibit your ability

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.690 align:middle line:90%
to recall your dreams.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you have an
unhealthy sleep cycle--

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you won't
remember your dreams.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Exactly.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:90%
We only dream in our REM cycle.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got to
get to that deep sleep

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.880 align:middle line:84%
before you can
recall your dreams.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you're getting up a lot
at night to use the bathroom,

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.700 align:middle line:84%
or if you're waking
up because you

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:84%
have a little
infant, or a puppy,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:84%
or you're waking
up because there's

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.973 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stress going
on in your life,

00:25:45.973 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
recall your dreams.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
precognitive dreams,

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:84%
like your breast cancer, and
like so many people have,

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.510 align:middle line:90%
what causes that?

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:90%
What causes that dream?

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I think it goes back to a
fascinating debate of free will

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:90%
and destiny.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, how much free will
do we have here on Earth?

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And how much of our
life is predestined?

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, personally,
just my opinion,

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe before we come
to Earth that we create

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:90%
with our guides our soul plan.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.220 align:middle line:84%
That kind of just says, you
know, OK, well, at this age,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
be in Saint Louis.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.540 align:middle line:84%
At this age, you're going to
get on this amazing show "Coast

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:90%
to Coast."

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.062 align:middle line:84%
At this age, you're going
to have these children.

00:26:23.062 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:84%
That just marks out the big
parts of our life, right?

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we have a scary
big mark in our life or a very

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:35.180 align:middle line:84%
happy one, oftentimes, our
subconscious remembers it

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.100 align:middle line:90%
and will recall it in a dream.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
certain incidents,

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.560 align:middle line:84%
like my former husband getting
shot in the line of duty,

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.200 align:middle line:90%
I believe that was predestined.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at the
events that surrounded that,

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:90%
there was no getting out of it.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:90%
There were so many--

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could it have
been changed and altered?

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I don't believe
that it could have.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I really
don't because there

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:84%
were, for example, the ambulance
was on scene that night

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.853 align:middle line:84%
because they had been called out
to a house just a block away.

00:27:04.853 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fortunately, right?

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yeah, by a
prank call, and they

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.700 align:middle line:90%
don't know who made that call.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:84%
I became very good friends
with the ambulance man

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:90%
who assisted him at that night.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know where
the call originated from.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the
prank call basically

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.072 align:middle line:84%
save your husband's
life at the time?

00:27:20.072 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: I believe so.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:21.800 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if we had
not been there on scene,

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.910 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't have lived
because he coded twice

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.380 align:middle line:90%
on the way to the hospital.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.448 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: And when they
got to the hospital,

00:27:29.448 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:84%
the thoracic surgeon-- he
needed a very particular

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
thoracic surgeon,
and he happened

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:84%
to have been there because he
was called in for another case

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:90%
and was leaving.

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.630 align:middle line:84%
He was keys in hand
Dr. David told me

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.580 align:middle line:84%
he was getting ready to
go home for the night,

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.870 align:middle line:90%
and he was there.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And he needed an entire
blood transfusion,

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:52.052 align:middle line:84%
and the exact type of blood
they needed was in that ER.

00:27:52.052 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everything
worked for him.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Everything worked out.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.312 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything worked out.

00:27:55.312 --> 00:27:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: It was so wild.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think some things
in our life are destined.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
they're that big,

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes we recall them
in these dream experiences.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there some
entity, some thing

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:90%
that feeds us these dreams?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Possibly.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I think really it's the
collective consciousness.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is this web
woven within and around all

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:90%
of us that connects us all.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.420 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the Princeton
EGG random computer

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:84%
generating experiments
that have been done.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't that tend--

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Roger Nelson.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yeah, doesn't that tend
to prove this idea that we're

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.263 align:middle line:90%
all in this together?

00:28:30.263 --> 00:28:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I call it
the wireless internet.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're all hooked up.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm hooked up to you.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.870 align:middle line:90%
You're hooked up to me.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Tom, our producer, is
hooked up to somebody else.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's how it works.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and that's why like if
you're thinking about Tom,

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.530 align:middle line:90%
like, Oh, I've got to--

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell him that we got
to get this person on the show,

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:84%
he'll call you
within five minutes.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, Oh, I was
just about to call you.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.368 align:middle line:90%
That's that wireless network.

00:28:53.368 --> 00:28:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There have been moments
where I'll tell him something,

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and he's writing it
down before I tell him.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.907 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Wow.

00:29:00.907 --> 00:29:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, how
does that stuff happen?

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: I know.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's
how all of this happens.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's how these
precognitive and soul travel

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.697 align:middle line:84%
dreams occur is that
we're all connected

00:29:10.697 --> 00:29:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and the information is all
there, past, present, future.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the astral school?

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: The astral school,
this happened to me

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.390 align:middle line:84%
when I was early on-- so
it's shortly after 2005

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.765 align:middle line:84%
when I realized all these
precognitive dreams were coming

00:29:23.765 --> 00:29:24.565 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:29:24.565 --> 00:29:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I need
to figure this out.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:84%
So I was taking a lot of
intuitive development classes

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.510 align:middle line:90%
during the day.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But at night, I kept
having these dreams

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:90%
where I was going to school.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was learning how
to be more intuitive, how

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.050 align:middle line:84%
to do healing work, how to
send and transfer energy.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.110 align:middle line:84%
There were the same
people in these dreams.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:90%
We were friends.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, I don't know,
it was kind of strange,

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.400 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't really
share it with anybody.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But I enjoyed them and I
learned a lot from their dreams.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I read
your aunt's book,

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.580 align:middle line:90%
"Breakthrough to Creativity."

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And she has at
least two chapters

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
on what she calls
the astral school.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was all these friends and
colleagues of hers that she--

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Brilliant work.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: It was such
a brilliant book.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.190 align:middle line:84%
She interviewed all these
friends and colleagues

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.160 align:middle line:90%
who talked about--

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.120 align:middle line:84%
one had an MBA, and she at
night would go to school

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and learn more business things.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.610 align:middle line:84%
One of her friends
was a doctor, and he

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.290 align:middle line:84%
would go to this
astral school and learn

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.670 align:middle line:90%
different medical techniques.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.555 align:middle line:84%
And this was written in the
late 1960s, if my memory--

00:30:24.555 --> 00:30:25.355 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:30:25.355 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, so he
couldn't really go

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:84%
around telling his
colleagues like I'm having

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:90%
these astral school dreams.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.030 align:middle line:10%
And he'd get into the office,
his patients would come in,

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.520 align:middle line:10%
and suddenly, he was
seeing their aura

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.050 align:middle line:10%
with his physical eye.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to see
the illness in their aura.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.262 align:middle line:84%
And so your aunt wrote
beautifully about that

00:30:44.262 --> 00:30:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and how he couldn't
really talk about it,

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.070 align:middle line:84%
but how it helped
him in his diagnoses.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, she devoted her
entire psychiatric practice

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:55.060 align:middle line:84%
to the paranormal,
telepathy, dreams, all that.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.810 align:middle line:90%
She was fascinated by that.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: But she kept
it very grounded--

00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And scientific.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yeah, scientific
and very intelligent.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.125 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:31:02.125 --> 00:31:02.925 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:31:02.925 --> 00:31:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: And that
really made me feel

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.870 align:middle line:84%
more confident about sharing
some of those experiences

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.730 align:middle line:90%
on my podcast and with friends.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
getting emails

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.078 align:middle line:84%
from people saying that
happens to me, too.

00:31:14.078 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know how she died?

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: No.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:19.383 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was in the tub
and a radio fell in the tub.

00:31:19.383 --> 00:31:20.425 align:middle line:90%
And she got electrocuted.

00:31:20.425 --> 00:31:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Oh, that's terrible.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.270 align:middle line:90%
How old was she?

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, she must
have been in her 60s.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Oh, too young.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.082 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I mean
what a way to go.

00:31:27.082 --> 00:31:28.575 align:middle line:90%
How bizarre, huh?

00:31:28.575 --> 00:31:29.950 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Especially
with her brain,

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:10%
can you imagine what else
she could have shared?

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God, she would
have come up with more stuff.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we had Uri
Geller on the radio show

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:90%
some time ago.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.382 align:middle line:90%
He's a genius.

00:31:41.382 --> 00:31:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Oh, yeah, he is.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.990 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Very powerful
and spiritual.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: And he's a
great example of how

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:84%
fear is the killer of all
this intuitive soul travel

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:50.770 align:middle line:90%
dream stuff.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fear shuts
you down, doesn't it?

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:55.962 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Remember when he showed
up on Johnny Carson and, yeah.

00:31:55.962 --> 00:31:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He thought
it would destroy him.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.878 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: It didn't, thankfully.

00:31:58.878 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It ended up making his
career even more of notoriety.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, as it should.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But I use that as an example
a lot to people who say,

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm too afraid to learn
about intuitive things.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm too afraid to
embrace my dreams.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Fear is the killer
of so much good.

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when people
hear this show and watch it,

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and tonight they go
and have a dream--

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --can they
control that dream?

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.910 align:middle line:10%
>>FEY: Yes, they
can with practice.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:24.730 align:middle line:10%
But I think, first
what you need to do

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:10%
before you want to
control your dream

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:10%
is focus on remembering
your dreams.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been
a lot of research

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.930 align:middle line:84%
into how we can work
to do that better.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things is
looking at the two hours

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:37.940 align:middle line:90%
before you go to sleep.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So many of us are on our phones,
or we're falling asleep to TV,

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.580 align:middle line:84%
or we've got blue light from
a Wi-Fi router in our room.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.680 align:middle line:84%
All of that stuff is
going to really affect--

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're being
bombarded by that.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:49.465 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: We are.

00:32:49.465 --> 00:32:49.750 align:middle line:90%
And we--

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Charging your phone.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it charged, are my AirPods,
is my Apple Watch charged,

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:90%
all of that.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.340 align:middle line:84%
You've got to put that
all away, if you really

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
want to recall your dreams
because the blue light and all

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:84%
that tech coming at us
it affects your melatonin

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:03.840 align:middle line:90%
production.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And melatonin is what
helps us recall our dreams.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.290 align:middle line:84%
So I always tell people,
look at the two hours

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.200 align:middle line:84%
before you go to sleep and
try to do something calming,

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.740 align:middle line:84%
some light yoga, meditation,
journaling, some prayers,

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.210 align:middle line:90%
whatever suits you.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:19.120 align:middle line:10%
And then fall asleep with
a thought or a question

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.933 align:middle line:10%
on your mind, you're much more
likely to recall your dreams.

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, one
of the things I

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:84%
used to use in my
earlier days when

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I wanted a specific
job was to concentrate

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:34.240 align:middle line:84%
before I went to sleep on that
individual who did the hiring.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:38.500 align:middle line:84%
I would find out who it was, I'd
get a little picture of them,

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and I'd just concentrate and
concentrate and concentrate

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.640 align:middle line:84%
about getting that job
and sending messages

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.080 align:middle line:90%
to that person's head.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And like the next
day, after I woke up,

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I'd get a call from the company.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So-and-so would like you to
come in for an interview today.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.408 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:33:56.408 --> 00:33:58.825 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: That's the wireless
network you were talking about.

00:33:58.825 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Isn't that fascinating?

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I put my thoughts into
that guy's head and got hired.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:04.917 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, I love that.

00:34:04.917 --> 00:34:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've done
that several times.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.417 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, it works.

00:34:07.417 --> 00:34:10.670 align:middle line:84%
It's actually that technique
is going viral on TikTok

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.480 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.531 align:middle line:10%
And young people are
acting like it's brand new.

00:34:13.531 --> 00:34:14.989 align:middle line:84%
They call it the
whisper technique,

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.489 align:middle line:90%
but it's been around forever.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon Hill wrote about how
when he was researching how men

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:84%
became successful to write
his famous book "Think

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and Grow Rich," he
had this routine down

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.170 align:middle line:90%
when he was falling asleep.

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.739 align:middle line:84%
And he created a bunch of
people he admired and respected.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:32.210 align:middle line:90%
He called it his dream team.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And he would visualize himself
sitting at a conference

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:84%
table with them and
talking about this book

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.659 align:middle line:90%
and this project and this idea.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was all these
people that he admired.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
Abraham Lincoln.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it all
happened in his imagination

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.250 align:middle line:90%
just as he was falling asleep.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And he'd imagine
what they'd say back.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.520 align:middle line:90%
And so he wrote the book.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.150 align:middle line:90%
It became a big hit.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.090 align:middle line:84%
He didn't do the
dream team anymore.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.219 align:middle line:84%
And he had a dream one
night where Abraham Lincoln

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.740 align:middle line:84%
came to him and said, why
did you stop the dream team

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.725 align:middle line:90%
meetings, we miss you.

00:34:59.725 --> 00:35:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm going
to tell you a funny story.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: OK.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
dream related directly

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.740 align:middle line:84%
but it's about this
wireless network we're in.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I used to produce a television
show back in Detroit

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:13.650 align:middle line:90%
back around 1976, '77.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:17.190 align:middle line:84%
My anchorman was a fellow by
the name of Ken Thomas, changed

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:90%
his name for TV.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.680 align:middle line:84%
He'd come in with
his little son.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Little kid, must have
been 5 or 6 years old.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:25.530 align:middle line:84%
The kid would run
all over the studio,

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:28.020 align:middle line:84%
look at the camera lights,
and stuff like that.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And Ken was with us
for a couple of years.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.380 align:middle line:90%
He ended up leaving.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And he moved his family
to the West Coast.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Jump ahead, I'm being
interviewed for the job

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:90%
at "Coast to Coast."

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm with the
president of the network.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a picture
of the anchorman

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.110 align:middle line:90%
on his desk whose name--

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.120 align:middle line:90%
real name was Ken Kitchen.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.730 align:middle line:84%
The guy who hired me
was Craig Kitchen.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:53.840 align:middle line:90%
He was the little boy.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: The little
five-year-old boy.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
make that stuff up.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: You can't make that up.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I told him
that story, and he--

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:06.370 align:middle line:84%
it dawned on him right away who
I was after I told him that.

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:07.890 align:middle line:90%
And I got hired on the spot.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.015 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Of course, wow.

00:36:09.015 --> 00:36:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we've been doing
it for 20 plus years now.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.270 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Isn't that fascinating?

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.730 align:middle line:84%
That's part of those things that
I feel are kind of predestined.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:20.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, like that was
a part of your soul plan.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But who's doing that?

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Me, him, or something else?

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I think it's
a collaboration.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are people
that we agree to incarnate

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.790 align:middle line:90%
with at a certain time.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:90%
And you can call them soulmates.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.460 align:middle line:84%
You can call them soul
friends, what have you.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.180 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
this elaborate plan that

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.790 align:middle line:84%
comes into place before
we come to Earth.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there's a lot of free
will that comes in with that.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.160 align:middle line:90%
One of the things my--

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.430 align:middle line:84%
the audio was so poor when
I was recording my dad.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things he
kept saying is that they were

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.870 align:middle line:90%
telling him there are two me's.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.275 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I stopped
listening to myself.

00:36:57.275 --> 00:36:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: And so I
think sometimes what

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.920 align:middle line:84%
happens is we have
this soul plan,

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.200 align:middle line:84%
it's all elaborate and
planned out beautifully,

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.840 align:middle line:84%
like effortlessly
meeting your friend's son

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.260 align:middle line:90%
and getting the job.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.260 align:middle line:84%
But if we stop
listening to ourselves,

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, we don't fall
into sync with that plan.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had another episode
where I was driving literally

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:23.380 align:middle line:84%
coming up on a four lane
intersection with four lights.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.820 align:middle line:90%
They were all over the place.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a green
light, so you go.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Right.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
tells me don't

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:29.800 align:middle line:90%
go through the green light.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't go through
the green light.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.010 align:middle line:90%
And I've got cars behind me.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm going what are you nuts?

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Don't go through
the green light.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.850 align:middle line:90%
So I pulled over to the right.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:84%
At the moment I would have
gone through the intersection

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
with my green light, a car
comes through its red light

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and would have broadsided me
right on the driver's side.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Wow.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.138 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What creates that?

00:37:53.138 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: What creates that?

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I think
it's part of dreaming.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Precognition.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all together.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, and I think it's all
part of our team, your guides,

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.450 align:middle line:90%
your angels, what have you.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:04.500 align:middle line:90%
I think it's all--

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:08.100 align:middle line:84%
we have all these invisible
helpers around us all the time.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.870 align:middle line:84%
When my oldest
daughter was little,

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.750 align:middle line:84%
she woke up one morning,
she was three years old,

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and she said, mommy, did you
know I have a guardian angel?

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And I said, sure, honey, we
all have a guardian angel.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, mine
visited me last night.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:90%
And his name is Odin.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, Odin, like how could
a three-year-old come--

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Odin.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: I'm going through
like all the Disney movies--

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a Viking name.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Right, and so
I'm thinking that's odd.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So anyway flash forward to
when she's eight years old,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.090 align:middle line:90%
and in school--

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.570 align:middle line:84%
my kids went to
parochial school.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So she had to write a project
on her guardian angel.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And she's reading it to me
as we're driving to school.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And she says, my guardian
angel is a beautiful woman

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:90%
named Brittany.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And she's telling me about this
pretty hair that her angel.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Olivia, that's not--
that's not your angel's name.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.590 align:middle line:90%
You told me it was Odin.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Oh, I would
never have a boy as an angel.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're at a stoplight, and
there's this white Porsche

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.625 align:middle line:90%
next to us revving its engine.

00:39:06.625 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
anything of it

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.813 align:middle line:84%
because Porsche's often
rev their engines.

00:39:09.813 --> 00:39:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: But the light turns
green and the Porsche takes off

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and the license plate
said Odin number one.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: And I said, Olivia, look,
that's proof that your guardian

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.940 align:middle line:90%
angel is named Odin.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Oh, I don't want
a boy for a guardian angel.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a call
on the radio show

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.220 align:middle line:84%
years ago from a lady who
said her little girl would

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.380 align:middle line:90%
dream about a playmate.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And the playmate and her
would talk all the time.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just found
it a little strange

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.650 align:middle line:84%
she kept dreaming
of this little girl.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And then one day she
came in and said--

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and let's call the
little girl Julie.

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:84%
She said, mama, I had a
dream about Julie last night.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And she told me she
died in this house.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:90%
And she's buried here.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And the mother went, what?

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Now she's getting
concerned, right?

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She said, yes, they
buried her bones right here.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:06.240 align:middle line:84%
She takes her in a room and the
mother just decided at a whim

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.760 align:middle line:84%
to call police and they
came and dug up the floor

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and found the bones
of a little girl.

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Oh, my gosh.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How does that happen?

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.467 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: How does that happen?

00:40:15.467 --> 00:40:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Something similar
happened to us.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:18.970 align:middle line:84%
One of my daughters kept
dreaming about a girl

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:21.190 align:middle line:90%
in a blue dress in our house.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, uh-oh, we
hadn't been there long.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.120 align:middle line:90%
I thought this is not good.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I had some friends over
who were really intuitive.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.500 align:middle line:90%
And they did sense her as well.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I did this prayer
and I asked her, I said,

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:84%
it's not my job to tell you
where you can and can't go,

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.540 align:middle line:84%
but don't come into our
house and scare my children.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So just do not
come in the house.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.278 align:middle line:84%
And two days after that, my
other daughter who had not

00:40:46.278 --> 00:40:48.070 align:middle line:84%
heard about the dream
because I didn't want

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.440 align:middle line:84%
to scare my other
kids said, mom,

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.110 align:middle line:84%
do you see that girl
standing in the cul-de-sac?

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:55.030 align:middle line:90%
She's wearing a blue dress.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.278 align:middle line:84%
So she was still there,
but she was listening

00:40:57.278 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:90%
and wasn't coming in the house.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
mentioned Abraham Lincoln.

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He had a dream.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
in the White House

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.860 align:middle line:84%
and was walking
through the state room

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and saw soldiers there
with their rifles standing

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:90%
over a casket.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.100 align:middle line:84%
He looked in, and it
was a casket of him.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.733 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's exactly
how they laid him out.

00:41:16.733 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Exactly how-- and
you know that again, those

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.620 align:middle line:84%
examples, because he had
several dream experiences.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And his wife had
seances in the home.

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:27.147 align:middle line:90%
And they were very open to this.

00:41:27.147 --> 00:41:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mary was
her name, wasn't it?

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yes, Mary Todd.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell
people, if you want

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to engage your dreams in
this soul travel kind of way,

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:39.200 align:middle line:84%
it really does help to be
open to this during your day.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And so luckily,
he was open to it.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he had so
many dream experiences.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly, he even
appeared to Winston Churchill

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.110 align:middle line:84%
when he was visiting
the White House.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:50.785 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah, he was--

00:41:50.785 --> 00:41:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find,
Samantha, that creative people,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.820 align:middle line:90%
successful people dream a lot?

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Yes, yes,
right-brained people

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.800 align:middle line:84%
tend to have better
dream recall and are

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.620 align:middle line:84%
able to get a lot more
information and insight.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole
section in the book

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.420 align:middle line:84%
on just famous people who
have come up with insights

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.950 align:middle line:90%
from their dreams.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Paul McCartney, I
think, pretty much

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:16.310 align:middle line:84%
everyone knows that he
dreamt the whole lyric

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:18.530 align:middle line:90%
melody to "Yesterday."

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And he thought he stole it
because it was so perfect.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And it just came
to him in a dream.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he realized,
nope, this is just mine.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.890 align:middle line:90%
So there are so many.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Billy Joel recently
said that all his music

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.940 align:middle line:90%
has come to him in a dream.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Stephen King dreamt the
entire concept of "Misery"

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:37.303 align:middle line:90%
while flying to London.

00:42:37.303 --> 00:42:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating to look
at the creative people that

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.320 align:middle line:84%
have come up with things
we consider classics today

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.160 align:middle line:90%
from their dream.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
artist Keith Richards?

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Oh, he was
in a hotel on tour,

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and he was just strumming
on his guitar as you do.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And he liked to record himself
just to see if it sounded OK.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing that,
and he fell asleep

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.460 align:middle line:90%
with the guitar in his hand.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And he woke up in
the morning, and he

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.150 align:middle line:84%
saw that the tape
had gone to the end.

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And he was like,
well, that's weird.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And so he played
it and somehow when

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.410 align:middle line:84%
he was sleeping and dreaming,
he had played all the chords to

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:10.870 align:middle line:90%
"Can't Get No Satisfaction."

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about that?

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: Yeah.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.688 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are dreams things
that will be, or could be?

00:43:16.688 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FEY: Well, that's a
really good question.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that if you have a
dream and it feels very, very

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:25.380 align:middle line:84%
precognitive, it could
be a will be situation.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.940 align:middle line:10%
But if it's a situation that
repeats where you have it

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:32.130 align:middle line:10%
over and over, like my dream
with the neck and the bullet--

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:32.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>FEY: That to me is will be.

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.300 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to believe
we all have free will.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Samantha, where do
we get this incredible book,

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.050 align:middle line:90%

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.600 align:middle line:84%

00:43:51.535 --> 00:43:54.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The next time you
dream, be it tonight, remember

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.860 align:middle line:10%
it, write it down in a
journal, and track it,

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.600 align:middle line:10%
and just see what happens.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
