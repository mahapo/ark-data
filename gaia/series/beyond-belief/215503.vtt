>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:10%
JJ Brighton with us is a light
language channeler and creator

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.560 align:middle line:10%
of the multi-dimensional
soul integration

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:10%
modality, which facilitates
a rapid soul evolution.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And today, you will hear
her riveting channel

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:90%
of the Andromedan star mothers.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Lots to get into.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, JJ.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JJ BRIGHTON: Hello, George.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Such a pleasure to be
here with you today.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did this
all start for you?

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Wow.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.100 align:middle line:90%
It has been a journey.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:10%
Like most spiritual people,
I started the day I was born,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:10%
tuning in to things that you
don't see with your eyes,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:10%
feeling energies.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And throughout that time,
I've evolved, obviously,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:84%
into a place where I connect
with interdimensional beings,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and ascended masters,
and all kinds of energies

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
that are here to assist us
through the ascension process.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you teach yourself,
or did you have a helper?

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I'm
mostly self-taught,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of
unique, but I do

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
consider all of my
beautiful spirit team

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.337 align:middle line:90%
to be my teachers as well.

00:01:20.337 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
deal a lot with what

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:90%
is called light language.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:84%
What is that, and
how does that work?

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Well, light
language is a lot of things.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:10%
But to put it
concisely, I would say

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.330 align:middle line:10%
it is a multidimensional
form of communication that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:10%
allows us to be able to transmit
and communicate frequencies

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:10%
that regular languages, like
English, for instance, can't do.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: JJ, what are the
three types of light languages?

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: So you have
spoken light language, which

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:90%
is most familiar to people.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.070 align:middle line:84%
You have written light
language, like sigils, symbols,

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:90%
sacred geometry.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you have hand
or body light language.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the hand or body,
is that people expressing

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:90%
themselves when they talk?

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Yeah.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.139 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it could come out that
way when you're intentionally

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:84%
doing it with light
language, oftentimes, you're

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.260 align:middle line:90%
moving energy.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they
call it light languages?

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Well, in my opinion,
language implies something

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:90%
that you're communicating.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:84%
You're using communication
forms to transmit

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:90%
different frequencies.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And light is
frequency, and that's

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
what we're intending to do when
we transmit light language.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find that some
leaders use light languages

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
in certain ways to
influence people?

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I would say there
is a lot of nonverbal kinds

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:84%
of communication that
you could consider

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
to be a language
like light language

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:90%
that people use all the time.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We do it consciously and
sometimes, even subconsciously.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
science behind this?

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: There are
absolutely researchers

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
who have studied the idea of
sounds and prelinguistic sounds

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
in particular, which is where
light language is grounded in.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.935 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look into
linguistic research,

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:84%
for instance, with the
spoken light language,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
but even the
development of language

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning of
time, anthropologists,

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
different researchers
have absolutely

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:90%
seen how it has evolved.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
to note that the roots

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:84%
of those languages oftentimes
have a common thread.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: JJ, are there
various learning styles

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.960 align:middle line:90%
that tie into light languages?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And what are they?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So I tend to be
a visual learner.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So for me, writing light
codes or light language

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
down as symbols is the way
that I'm most prone to do it.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But for those people
who are more auditory,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:84%
they might find themselves
speaking the light language.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And for people who
are kinesthetic

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
or learners that learn
through movement,

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:84%
they may find themselves moving
the hands to do light language.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
know what you might be?

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.258 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I would
say if you go online,

00:04:01.258 --> 00:04:03.967 align:middle line:84%
there are lots of tests that you
can take that will just tell you

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
what kind of learner
you are, and it's

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:84%
a great resource, not
just for light language,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
but anybody who's wanting
to learn how to channel.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is any one
better than the next?

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Well, no.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.887 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're all here
carrying our unique frequency

00:04:16.887 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
of divinity, and we
all have something

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:90%
to share with the world.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had an
incredible spiritual awakening

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:90%
back in 2018.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: That is correct.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:90%
It was big.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, what
happened is I got to a point

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
where I was in organized
religion and an organized belief

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
system, you could say, that
had made up most of my life.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I began to realize

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.110 align:middle line:84%
that there was a ceiling
almost in that belief system,

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to
expand beyond it.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do
that, I essentially

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:84%
had to deconstruct
everything that I

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:84%
knew to be, quote unquote,
true, and allow myself

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
to entertain ideas that I
had never before thought of.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should I ask you
what religion that was?

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Christianity.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And was it
dramatic that you

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:90%
had to make that change?

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: It
was very dramatic.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:90%
It was very dramatic.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was it emotional?

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: It was
very emotional.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I actually went
through an entire year

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.130 align:middle line:84%
where I feel like I sort of just
detached from all spirituality,

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a
little moment of just

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
unplugging to reset and reboot
everything that I believed in.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I had been very spiritual
up until that point.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I had always felt like
I could communicate

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle line:90%
with angels and with God.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, for that time,
I just tuned everything out,

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:90%
allowed myself to go within.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I was able
to get to where I am today.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: JJ, what is the
phrase, speaking in tongues,

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:90%
mean to you?

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Well, that is
a phrase that is commonly

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:90%
used in Christianity.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
found in the Bible.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And in my personal opinion,
speaking in tongues

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
is very similar
to light language

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:84%
because it allows you to
convey those frequencies

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:84%
that normal language, like
English, for instance, limits.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.917 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually how I got
my start with light language.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, a friend introduced
you to galactic beings

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:90%
and light language.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:84%
That was taking it
to the next level.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So going from
connecting with angels

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
to interdimensional beings
was quite an adventure.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, what we did
was I was introduced to her,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and she was, I would say, a more
advanced channeler than I was.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
She was connecting with
these offplanet beings

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.670 align:middle line:84%
from other dimensions,
beings of light

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:90%
that were aligned with my path.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And we would hop
on a phone call,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and then we would just
start going back and forth

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and sharing what was
coming through for us,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and we created this
synergy that opened up

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.308 align:middle line:84%
a whole world of
different connections.

00:06:59.308 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the ones that
stands out for me most

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.050 align:middle line:90%
is the Ninth Density Arcturians.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Later, toward the end,
JJ is going to do a channeling.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Stick around and
make sure you watch

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:90%
that because that's incredible.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Now you created a
podcast as well.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: I did.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
It was actually in
the midst of COVID.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:90%
And I just had to speak.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I needed to share what
was happening with me.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge part
of the processing,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.680 align:middle line:84%
of the deconstruction
of all my beliefs.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.450 align:middle line:90%
So I still remember this.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
kids, a big family.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't really record at my
house, so I would get in my car,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and I would drive
somewhere quiet,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and I would actually
record on my phone.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's how my
podcast started.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: While driving?

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: No, no.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:90%
I would park the car.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:90%
I would park the car.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
hear this podcast?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I
honestly don't know

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.290 align:middle line:84%
how people found me
because nobody knew

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.542 align:middle line:90%
who I was in my regular life.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you call it?

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Activations with JJ.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I first started, I
shared it with one person,

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and then I started
sharing on social media,

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:90%
and people would just find it.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
The energy of it, I
imagine, attracted them

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:90%
to what they needed.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's just
grown exponentially.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.132 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful now.

00:08:16.132 --> 00:08:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big
is your following?

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: So I have
40,000 on my YouTube.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.560 align:middle line:84%
That's the predominant
platform for me.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you really?

00:08:23.015 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Thank you.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And again,
they can find you by?

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Well,
activationswithjj.com.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:90%
The podcast is on YouTube.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:84%
It's also on Spotify,
Apple Podcasts,

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:90%
all the podcast platforms.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
basically try to teach people?

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Wow.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.549 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm
less of a teacher,

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like I'm more
of a friend and a guide

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that is co-creating this
ascension journey with people,

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
where I feel-- you know,
when I record the podcast,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I can actually feel the
presence of the people that

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:90%
will be listening later.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I step
outside of time and space,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and I'm able to just feel like
we're sitting around a campfire,

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:90%
chatting about these things.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And it allows me to
get over my own self

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and my fears to
express whatever I feel

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
would be in alignment
to help all of us who

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:90%
are on this journey together.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:90%
We're doing this together.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:90%
This is collective ascension.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not individual.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
We are banding together and
helping each other on this path.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.482 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: JJ, how many beings
and entities do you channel?

00:09:27.482 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: That's
a great question

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
because I was thinking about
that before I came on today.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And it would be fun
for me to count.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.554 align:middle line:84%
But I tend to consider myself
a starseed linguist in that

00:09:41.554 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:84%
in my regular education,
I actually studied

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:84%
linguistics and learned
multiple languages,

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:90%
and I do the same now.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't
even have a number.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Dozens upon dozens of
beings have come forward.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I feel like an
interdimensional radio station.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, give me a ballpark.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I
would say over 100.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Different channelers?

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes,
Different beings.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And where are they?

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Where are they channeling from?

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: They are from
higher frequency locations.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that my
frequency signals what

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:90%
frequencies I'm calling in.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So I never have to worry about
who and what wants to connect,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and all of them have messages
to support the ascension process

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.040 align:middle line:84%
for humans, whether
they be angelic beings,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional star
beings, ascended masters,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:90%
even elemental frequencies.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I once channeled the
minerals of the earth.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are any dead humans?

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I have
done mediumship.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I have connected with
different people that

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.280 align:middle line:84%
have lived on the planet in the
past, and that's always fun.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:84%
That happened at the
beginning of my journey.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But now, I tend to be connecting
with more off-planet beings.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have ascended
masters dealing with you?

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: I do.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I love connecting with Saint
Germain, Sanat Kumara, Mary

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene, Yeshua.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Mary Magdalene?

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about Jesus?

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You deal with Jesus?

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I connect
with him frequently.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do he is who he is?

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: I feel it.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:21.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not a knowing.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't think this
entity is tricking you or trying

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:90%
to deceive you?

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: No.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does he want?

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: He wants
us to feel supported

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:90%
and to enjoy this journey.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.963 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does he ever talk
about his crucifixion?

00:11:40.963 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Well, that's
an interesting thing.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:84%
I have tuned in about his
history and what I have found,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and I've heard other channelers
mention this before as well.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But there are actually
multiple timelines of his life,

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:84%
just like there are
multiple versions

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:90%
of you living your life.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
We're all living these
multiple parallel lives.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.652 align:middle line:84%
And so depending on the version
of his life that you tune into,

00:12:05.652 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:84%
depending on that
frequency, you're

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.943 align:middle line:84%
going to get a little
bit different history.

00:12:08.943 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you might notice
that there are channelers who

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:84%
have told his story and tuned
in to see what happened,

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:90%
and they're different.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sure you've
asked him about God.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: I have.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does he say?

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: He said we
are God, and God is us.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have to ask
him about the Big Bang

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.970 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't found one
physicist yet on my radio show

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.170 align:middle line:84%
to tell me what
the Big Bang was.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: In the
beginning was the word.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why language
is so important.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.403 align:middle line:84%
Vibration and frequency was
what created everything.

00:12:47.403 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we're going
to do some channeling

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.200 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the show,
but how quickly do

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:90%
you get into that mode?

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Well, that's the
fun thing about light language

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is that it is a
technology that can

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.340 align:middle line:84%
assist you to connect with
different frequencies very,

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.300 align:middle line:90%
very rapidly.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:90%
So I can do it pretty quick.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if I wanted
to chat with Jesus through you,

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:90%
could we do that?

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Sure.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can you do it now?

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that the presence of
both Jesus and Mary Magdalene

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:84%
want to come through
together as a divine union.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I will talk to her too.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:90%
So what's the process?

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.150 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I'll start
with some light language

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.630 align:middle line:84%
to help both of us
calibrate to the message.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

knew her mission.

for her expansion.

wisdom, growth, and expansion.

Homo luminous is
the evolved human.

>>NOORY: What is
the evolved human?

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: We are
beings of light.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Our frequency is higher.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.780 align:middle line:90%
And so we resonate.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And we are made of
light, essentially,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
as we transition into this,
what's called the New Age.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
We are absolutely holding
a higher quotient of light.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we are releasing
some of the denser energies

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.470 align:middle line:84%
that you could say are part
of Homo sapiens in order

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:84%
to transition into a different
kind of body, quite frankly.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about Earth's
ley lines, hotspots?

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Would they exist?

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Ooh, absolutely.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they help
you in your work?

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: They do.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting is
that the transition

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:10%
that Gaia is going through
herself as a celestial being

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:10%
and a celestial body is
mirroring the transition

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:10%
that our physical bodies
are going through.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So she has ley lines,
meridians you could say,

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:84%
just like our body has
meridians and ley lines.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.340 align:middle line:84%
As we activate ours
through different methods

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:84%
like light language, they
are being reflected in Gaia.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And as we assist Gaia in
activating her ley lines

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and energy nodes, that's going
to resonate within our body.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.320 align:middle line:90%
We will feel it.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does a
ley line mean to you?

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: For me, a ley line
is an energetic throughline

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that forms part of an
energetic grid or conduits,

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:90%
set of conduits of light.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the
light language that we

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:84%
deal with on a
regular basis, does

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.080 align:middle line:90%
that affect our consciousness?

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: It 100% does.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Light language, I've been
told time and time again

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:84%
by my galactic guides,
many of my star family,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.030 align:middle line:84%
my Arcturian family,
my Pleiadian family,

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:84%
that light language
and all of its forms

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:37.020 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
powerful technologies

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.960 align:middle line:84%
we have on the planet
to make the quantum

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.130 align:middle line:90%
leaps that we are now making.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we need
it to make that leap?

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I think that it will
become very indispensable to us

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.280 align:middle line:84%
because the frequencies
are ramping up

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.830 align:middle line:84%
at such a high velocity, that
without it, it will become

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:90%
very uncomfortable for us.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you very intuitive?

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: I would say yes.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think I am too.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.650 align:middle line:84%
How does that play
a role in this?

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Well,
intuition is a great way

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.730 align:middle line:84%
to explain how we even
speak light language.

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I feel like light language is
just intuitive soul language.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're intuitive,
you can absolutely

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.155 align:middle line:90%
speak light language.

00:24:24.155 --> 00:24:24.955 align:middle line:90%
If you feel like--

00:24:24.955 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone's
intuitive, but if you

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
feel that your
intuition is heightened,

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
then light language will
be very, very easy for you.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: JJ, what is a
multiple timeline convergence?

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Oooh.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a period of
a cycle of evolution.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
what we're looking

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:84%
at is along with an
ascension process,

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.400 align:middle line:84%
you have the expansion
and the contraction.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's been a bunch of
expansion in multiple timelines,

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and we are entering a zero point
phase where all of the timelines

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.990 align:middle line:90%
are converging.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And the 888 portal of
2024 was the marker point

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:90%
of that timeline convergence.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I spent that time
at Mount Shasta.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was receiving
a lot of information

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:84%
from my galactic guides,
my galactic team,

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:84%
ours, essentially, that all
of the timelines of our DNA,

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:84%
of our star families, were
being woven back into one,

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:34.080 align:middle line:84%
so that we could reconcile and
shift into this golden timeline

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.360 align:middle line:84%
together, not just
on a planetary basis

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.760 align:middle line:90%
but as the entire galaxy.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often are
you channeling, JJ?

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Every single day.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Every day?

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.028 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For how long?

00:25:47.028 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Oh, goodness.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.173 align:middle line:84%
I feel like everybody's
channeling all the time.

00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we're channeling
consciously and unconsciously

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.390 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But consciously channeling
interdimensional beings,

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.460 align:middle line:84%
I would say two to three
hours a day minimum.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intense.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: It's fun.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You feel
energized afterwards?

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: I do.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:90%
I feel-- I enjoy it.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
what they tell you?

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's one of the
most profound things they've

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:90%
told you?

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.970 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: That's a
hard question, George.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I think I can
articulate something.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Can I share something
in light language

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.926 align:middle line:84%
before I share it in
English, would that be OK?

00:26:29.926 --> 00:26:30.726 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:26:30.726 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: OK.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Of the most profound
messages I can convey,

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll share it first
in light language.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.386 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:26:39.386 --> 00:26:45.907 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.907 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:84%
The message that
wants to come through

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
is something I say at the
end of every single podcast.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It is profound but simple.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.866 align:middle line:84%
I am you, and you are
me, and we are we.

00:26:58.866 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And we are one is what I'll add.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The language you
speak, how understandable is it

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:90%
for most people?

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: That depends on
the level of play and intuition

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that they allow
themselves to step into

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and if they're listening with
their heart or with their mind.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
light language speakers?

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:26.873 align:middle line:90%
How do they pick up on you?

00:27:26.873 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I would
say people who

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
speak light language are
self-calibrating enough

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:84%
with the light language that
their ability to interpret

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:90%
and receive is expanded.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So absolutely, if you
have two light language

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
channelers together, it's going
to be a fun party for sure.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How fun?

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.502 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Yeah, so we got
to get you speaking, right?

00:27:48.502 --> 00:27:50.310 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.308 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would never
understand those words.

00:27:52.308 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: You don't have to
understand them with your mind.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.475 align:middle line:84%
You'll understand
them with your heart.

00:27:56.475 --> 00:27:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a
universal language?

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: It is absolutely
a universal language.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So think about the story
of the Tower of Babel, OK?

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're told in the Bible that
there was a period of time where

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
God made it so that people
couldn't understand each other.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, in my opinion,
the time before that

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.020 align:middle line:84%
was actually a time of
pure light language,

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.680 align:middle line:84%
where our souls were able
to express themselves

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
in the way that was
most conducive for them

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:90%
and that we understood.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So both the transmitting
and receiving was expanded,

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and the confounding of languages
basically put us in boxes

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.890 align:middle line:84%
to divide us as a collective,
so that we couldn't communicate

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.980 align:middle line:90%
heart to heart anymore.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that was something

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:90%
that an outside source did.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that's something
we manifested as humanity

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.710 align:middle line:84%
because we wanted to
experience what it

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:90%
would feel like to be separate.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.788 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does your family
speak light language with you?

00:28:58.788 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: A little bit.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they understand it?

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes, I have
some little ones that--

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I find that children are more
open to speaking light language.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
people that I assist

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.440 align:middle line:84%
in activating their light
language, that told me

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.700 align:middle line:84%
that they sound
like something they

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.200 align:middle line:84%
spoke when they
were four years old.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So my kids will
speak it with me.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's something
we feel more than understand

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.590 align:middle line:84%
consciously, but it's
a beautiful to be

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:90%
able to do that with them.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
take it to school?

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: No, no.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.310 align:middle line:84%
My kids know how to
bring information

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.490 align:middle line:90%
when people are ready.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So they understand
and are very intuitive

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and aware of the
environments where that fits

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes not.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of
like Harry Potter.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.142 align:middle line:84%
When you are in Hogwarts,
you do one thing,

00:29:49.142 --> 00:29:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, when you
go to the Muggle world,

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:90%
you do another thing.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people who do not
know you hear you speak it?

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Like people
in my everyday life?

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: No.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't really use it.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do it in
a supermarket or something

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.520 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I do
under my breath.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you get angry?

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Do I get angry
about life, about anything?

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Is the light language
a wholesome language,

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:90%
or is it also argumentative?

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Well,
I don't necessarily

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.110 align:middle line:84%
judge my emotions
as bad or good,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.510 align:middle line:84%
but light language can be
used to convey any emotion

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.080 align:middle line:90%
because it's a frequency.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So it can be used to convey any
kind of sadness, happiness, joy,

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.360 align:middle line:90%
anger.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did your
family say about this?

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Not your kids but your family.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Well,
a lot of my family,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.380 align:middle line:84%
to be completely
honest with you,

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:84%
probably doesn't know the extent
to which I'm doing it, but--

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They will after
they watch Beyond Belief.

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: They
will after they do.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:84%
I think when people
know your heart

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and they can feel that you are
absolutely embodying your soul

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:11.520 align:middle line:84%
purpose, that it softens their
hearts to know and understand

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.070 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing exactly what
you came on this planet to do,

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
feel like I'm doing.

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you tell somebody,

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:84%
JJ, if you were at the foot of
their bed, and they were dying.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.450 align:middle line:90%
And they're scared.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.750 align:middle line:90%
What do you tell them?

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: I would probably
speak light language.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And if it's OK, I'd like to
share a message that I would

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:90%
give them in light language.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:90%
And then interpret it for us.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: OK.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.415 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:46.415 --> 00:31:55.710 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:90%
You are loved.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.710 align:middle line:90%
You are worthy.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.230 align:middle line:90%
It is safe to go to the light.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And do you think they
would go happily, without fear?

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: I would hope so.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I would absolutely hope so.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever dealt
with somebody that just didn't

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:90%
get it, didn't understand it?

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: That's an
interesting question

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:84%
because I feel with
light language,

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:30.700 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of disarming
in that people

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:84%
can try to combat you when it
comes to thoughts and logic.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:40.690 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to the
heart, when you speak something

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.040 align:middle line:84%
like light language,
the conscious mind--

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.940 align:middle line:84%
it just bypasses
the conscious mind.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:52.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, there's nothing
you can say to come against it.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just
received with wonder.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.330 align:middle line:84%
It's received with
childlike wonder.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is light language
coming from the soul?

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.457 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:33:02.457 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: It does.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:07.940 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a place that
originates in the soul.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And that is purely
frequency based

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:16.270 align:middle line:84%
outside of the constructs
of our standard languages

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and our standard forms
of communication.

galactic beings?

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: All the time.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From where?

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Anywhere and
everywhere you can think of, I

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:29.950 align:middle line:90%
have channeled--

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I started with the Arcturians
and the Pleiadians.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I've channeled the
Lyrans, the Andromedans.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I've channeled other less
common interdimensional beings

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.600 align:middle line:90%
like Polarians, Hadarians.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I've channeled many
different beings

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.720 align:middle line:90%
from the Orion constellation.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.515 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, just all
over the universe.

00:33:52.515 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: All over.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I really am a galactic
radio station sometimes.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
Andromedan star mothers?

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Well, as you
can imagine from the name,

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.090 align:middle line:84%
they originate in the
Andromeda galaxy--

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.515 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: --which
a lot of channelers

00:34:07.515 --> 00:34:11.360 align:middle line:84%
say, and I believe the
same, is our future selves,

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.750 align:middle line:84%
is the more evolved
version of the Milky Way.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, you
can look up online

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.870 align:middle line:84%
that astronomers have
noticed that the Milky Way is

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.380 align:middle line:84%
getting closer and closer
to Andromeda, like they're

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:90%
overlapping.

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:84%
And so I see them as
our future selves.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But outside of time and space,
we exist simultaneously.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And being more evolved
at a higher frequency

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:37.090 align:middle line:84%
than we are currently,
they're able to support us

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:38.420 align:middle line:90%
through this process.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.107 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like going back
in time to tell yourself

00:34:41.107 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:84%
all the things that you
wish you would have known,

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.989 align:middle line:84%
and of course,
being star mothers,

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:48.190 align:middle line:84%
they are representing
the frequency

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.670 align:middle line:90%
of the divine feminine.

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:84%
And you could see it as if
we are like children to them,

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and we have come on
this planet being

00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:59.660 align:middle line:84%
seeded by a beautiful
variety of star mothers.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
the mothers of ETs?

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.240 align:middle line:84%
You could absolutely
see it that way.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we channel one?

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes,
I would love to.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.287 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So how do we
begin with this one?

00:35:11.287 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: I would do the same.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I would bring, and I
would calibrate myself

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:90%
with the light language.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll be
ready to answer

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.820 align:middle line:90%
any questions you might have.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:29.230 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.120 align:middle line:84%
We are a council of
Andromedan star mothers,

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.170 align:middle line:84%
ready and willing
to commune with you

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.720 align:middle line:90%
and communicate with you.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of the human race?

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: We love them.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And we are so
proud of where they

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:51.400 align:middle line:84%
are in this particular
cycle of ascension.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We are, however, a
very warring race of humans.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:35:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Many of the timelines have
expressed themselves through

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:05.290 align:middle line:84%
conflict, separation, and
war, and they have done this

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:08.860 align:middle line:84%
intentionally in order to
understand what it means to be

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:12.280 align:middle line:84%
not separate for without
understanding separation,

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.070 align:middle line:90%
you cannot understand union.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what we are meaning?

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe in God?

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: For us,
the concept of God

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:84%
is a little different
than from you.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes, we see
God as source, as light,

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.750 align:middle line:84%
flowing in, around,
and through all things.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:37.330 align:middle line:84%
That beingness from which
all life sprung forth.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a divine creator?

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:43.542 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: Yes, you
could see it that way.

00:36:43.542 --> 00:36:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
other humans that look

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:48.280 align:middle line:90%
like we do on other planets?

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Many.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many?

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: Countless.

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to the Mayans?

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: The Mayans
still exist on your planet,

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:01.960 align:middle line:84%
but they are vibrating at a
different frequency that you

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.870 align:middle line:84%
cannot see with
your physical eyes.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do so many
people on this planet

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:12.910 align:middle line:84%
not want to disclose
the existence of ETs?

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: This is
a collective fear,

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and the collective
fear is creating

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.120 align:middle line:90%
the reality of not knowing.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And when the
frequency of humanity

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:28.070 align:middle line:84%
shifts to one of openness and
love and unity consciousness,

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:30.940 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge will
flood in in waves,

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:35.600 align:middle line:84%
in ways that are potentially
difficult for you to understand,

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.730 align:middle line:84%
but it will be a joyous
time of expansion.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does
reincarnation exist?

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BRIGHTON: It does.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When a human
dies and it reincarnates,

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.730 align:middle line:84%
do they go to another planet,
or do they come back to Earth?

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIGHTON: All is
based on choice.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.870 align:middle line:84%
If they choose to go
to another planet,

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:01.210 align:middle line:84%
they can absolutely do that
for their soul journey.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.800 align:middle line:84%
But if they choose to
stay on the planet Earth,

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.120 align:middle line:90%
they can do that as well.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Some of this is determined
by the contracts they have

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.040 align:middle line:90%
with the different planets.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's an old saying,
what goes around, comes around.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.220 align:middle line:90%

however they decide to see it.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:11.900 align:middle line:84%

with the
interdimensionals, the goal

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:04.940 align:middle line:84%
is the collective
evolution of humanity,

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:09.520 align:middle line:84%
although there are
different ways to get there.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.420 align:middle line:84%

>>BRIGHTON: In one timeline.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you choose to be in
that timeline at a later date,

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.970 align:middle line:90%
it will occur in your timeline.

for you to do that?

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:10%

exhausting, but it

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:10%
does take practice to be able to
channel for longer time periods.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of what you do

>>NOORY: Channeling
an Andromedan star

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.500 align:middle line:90%
mother was fascinating.

something I'll never forget.
