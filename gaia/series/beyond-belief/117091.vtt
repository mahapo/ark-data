00:00:06.032 --> 00:00:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.682 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.270 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.350 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Gosh, the wonderment

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids--
they've fascinated me

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:10%
since I was a little boy and
with us on "Beyond Belief," Dr.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Carmen Boulter, who
has produced, written,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and directed, "The
Pyramid Code" and what

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
an incredible, incredible
documentary you've worked on,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Carmen.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the program.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARMEN BOULTER:
Thank you, George.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Very nice to be here.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How'd you get
interested in pyramids?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: Well, I started
having past life memories

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.884 align:middle line:10%
as a little girl and it was
all focused around Egypt.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:52.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: And so I
went there in 1977

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:10%
and I had planned to go
there from the time I was 12.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think
in another life--

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're believers
in reincarnation--

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.054 align:middle line:84%
that you may have
been an Egyptian?

00:01:04.054 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Absolutely.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm pretty sure of it
because when I'm there,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:10%
I just feel a lot of things.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:10%
And when I hear the tour
guides talking and telling

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:10%
a story that doesn't
seem right to me,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:10%
I just feel like I'm
going to pass out.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's something inside me
that knows a different truth

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.841 align:middle line:84%
than what we were told in
school about the pyramids

00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:90%
and the Egyptians.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.506 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a shame.

00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:25.730 align:middle line:84%
The recent developments in
Egypt these days I think

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
are really putting a damper
on tourism, which they

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:90%
can't afford to lose, can they?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: No but
since the revolution,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.554 align:middle line:84%
the tourism has
not come back up.

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all?

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.803 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: No.

00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:90%
I was there in April.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Things are normal and
quite safe but these events

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
keep happening and
scaring people away.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.661 align:middle line:90%
So tourism is way down.

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even though when
people think about pyramids,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.510 align:middle line:84%
they think about the
Giza pyramids in Egypt

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
but pyramids are
being discovered now

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
all over the
planet, aren't they?

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: They sure are
and it's quite surprising.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Bosnian pyramid has
achieved somewhat a notoriety

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and what you'll notice is it's
got three to four feet of soil

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:90%
over the top.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So to me, that speaks to the
idea of them being prediluvian,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:90%
before the flood.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when the water receded
after the great flood,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:84%
there was enough to--
enough soil to grow trees.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
at these pyramids,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
the trees are all
different heights.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it doesn't look like
a straight-sided pyramid.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So now, there is
much more openness

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.940 align:middle line:84%
to finding pyramids that
are covered in soil.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So they just found one in
Indonesia, Gunung Padang.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be going
there in a few weeks.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.470 align:middle line:84%
They're finding them in
Antarctica, all over-- Serbia.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But many, many, many
different countries now

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:90%
are coming up with pyramids.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
they, the ancients,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:84%
come up with that
architectural design

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:84%
to make the pyramids
the way they are?

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I find that
fascinating, that they're

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:90%
sprinkling all over the planet.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.422 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the same
architect did all the work.

00:02:57.422 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, it
certainly makes you wonder.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.328 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: If Egypt sprung
up in full magnificence

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and other countries-- other
civilizations, the Sumerians,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.830 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans, the east
Indians, and the Egyptians,

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
they really didn't seem to
be talking to one another.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're now thinking about
the third-party hypothesis,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.710 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps they all
had similar ancestors

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and similar teachers and
highly-evolved beings that

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
perhaps were seeding
all of these pyramids.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that that came
from another time and place,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:84%
where pyramids were
put on the grid,

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
on the telluric grid of
the planet for a purpose

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.399 align:middle line:90%
and that's why they're similar.

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Are you finding that where
the pyramids are located,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.935 align:middle line:84%
that there's some kind of
geographical similarity

00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:90%
all over the world?

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.912 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, I think
it's more telluric currents--

00:03:49.912 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that--

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.786 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: That cross.

00:03:51.786 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's energy in the
earth and there's places

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.199 align:middle line:90%
where these energies cross.

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ley lines?

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Ley lines, dragon
lines, you could call them,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and that seems to be where
the pyramids are located.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.099 align:middle line:84%
But there's other things that--
there's characteristic features

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:90%
of the straight-sided pyramids.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
They have water,
aquifers, underneath.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
There are strategically
placed chambers in all of them

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and there's also
different kinds of stones

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
that would conduct a
kind of magnetic energy,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:90%
magnetic resonance.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
There's quartz under pressure,
the double helix of quartz.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And so when these pyramids
are being examined,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.126 align:middle line:84%
we're finding that there's
many similarities in them.

00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Christopher Dunn
believes that the Great Pyramid

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.442 align:middle line:90%
is a power source.

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that's possible?

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: I sure do.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I sure do and some
people will talk

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
about how them being
in a closed system

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.519 align:middle line:84%
would help that
power be stronger

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and that opening the
pyramids wasn't a good idea.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:90%
That's one perspective, as well.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:84%
But now, there's new pyramids
being built, too, in Russia,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:90%
in Tomsk, Russia.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And Valery Uvarov is
someone who has really

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:84%
understood the science of
the quartz under pressure

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and how the different
chambers make resonant fields

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and that it's not necessarily
the angle of the pyramids.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
There's things that
don't matter as

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.844 align:middle line:84%
much, like the different--
like most pyramids in Egypt

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:90%
are a different angle.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Right?

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that's not the
characteristic feature

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
that dictates whether
or not they're

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:90%
going to be a power source.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But instead of
electrostatic energy,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.489 align:middle line:90%
it's electromagnetic energy.

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: And that's different.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've looked
at a lot of pyramids

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:90%
all around the planet.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:84%
You've been to how many
different countries now?

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: 57.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 57 countries.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: And counting.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you come
up with your own theory

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:84%
on how these
structures were built?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well it
seems that anti-gravity

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.090 align:middle line:90%
would have been used.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.659 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like floating
the blocks into position?

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Somehow
and when you see--

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing--

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: In Tibet, they have
those big horns that they blow

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:90%
and it's like a sound--

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sound resonance--

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Sound resonance,
sound and light technology.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And so in looking
for an understanding

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
of high-level
initiates and those

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.810 align:middle line:84%
that had power, some
kind of abilities,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:84%
we see that they
were telepathic.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:84%
They could bi-locate, teleport,
all these kinds of things.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And so anti-gravity is
a form of levitation

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and I think that all
of these were fields

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:90%
within fields within fields.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So they were using
the human energy

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:84%
of the high-level
initiates so that they

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.040 align:middle line:84%
were like human
divining rods, in a way.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So just the way the
synapses don't touch

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.952 align:middle line:84%
and they shoot a
hormone across, I

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:27.410 align:middle line:84%
think that the
high-level initiates

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:84%
were able to take cosmic energy
and ground it into the Earth

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and take the telluric
energy from the Earth

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:90%
and send it into the cosmos.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a human function.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you talk
about dating the pyramids,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look at a clip
from "The Pyramid Code."

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
You're-- you're
going to love this.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>Even Egyptologists agree
that the Giza Plateau

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:90%
has a unified ground plan.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:84%
How does the Great
Pyramid display

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:90%
evidence of this correlation?

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>I do think when it was what
we would call partially built,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:84%
it was used as a
astronomical observatory.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.400 align:middle line:84%
The grand gallery perfectly
aligned north-south,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.110 align:middle line:84%
opening to the
southern sky-- would've

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.410 align:middle line:84%
made a wonderful observational
tube, essentially,

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.097 align:middle line:90%
looking up into the sky.

00:07:15.097 --> 00:07:18.506 align:middle line:84%
>>We have shots pointing to
certain stars, Orion's Belt

00:07:18.506 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:84%
series-- we know the
stars because they're

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:90%
mentioned in the text.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:84%
We therefore can use
processional time

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.490 align:middle line:84%
to place the stars back in
alignment with these monuments,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.548 align:middle line:84%
in this case, the
pyramids, for example.

00:07:33.548 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>The Great Pyramid
stands exactly

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
at the center of the largest
land mass on the planet yet

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.210 align:middle line:84%
we had no idea of the
position of continents

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:90%
until 600 years ago.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.244 align:middle line:90%
How could they have known?

00:07:48.244 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, Carmen,
that's a great question.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.650 align:middle line:90%
How could they have known?

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:90%
How did they know this?

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.710 align:middle line:84%
How did they have this
kind of knowledge?

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Either we've lost it over all
these centuries or somebody

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:90%
told them.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, and it's a
very, very interesting question

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and of course, we're always
going to be speculating.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:84%
There's no one that's
going to come and tell us

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
where it all came from, where
the information came from.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:10%
But I'm starting to think
that the Atlanteans had

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:10%
a lot of this information
and that there were actually

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:10%
in the texts three different
catastrophes, not just one.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about
processional time,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:84%
which was just
mentioned in the clip,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that's 26,000-year cycles that
go from the Golden Age down

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:90%
into the Iron Age.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And so Atlantis had time to go
around several of these cycles.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we can't just
take one picture of it

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and say that's exactly
what Atlantis was.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:84%
There was enough
history in it and time

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.167 align:middle line:84%
to have known that there
were more disasters coming.

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're working
on a new documentary

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:90%
called "The New Atlantis."

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: I sure am.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.273 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aren't you?

00:08:48.273 --> 00:08:52.999 align:middle line:84%
And with that tie-in into
the Egyptian pyramids,

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.290 align:middle line:84%
we're going to bounce around
a little bit between Egypt

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:90%
and Atlantis.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But what do you think
Atlantis was at that time?

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: OK, so it was a
worldwide seafaring culture

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and I always want
to ground something

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:90%
in something that's verifiable.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And so there are texts that
talk about an asteroid hit.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:10%
And so the prediction was
"when the head of the crab

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:10%
hits the heart of
the lion," which

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:10%
is speaking to the idea of the
Cancer constellation colliding

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:10%
with the Leo constellation.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: Well, how
could that have happened?

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems that the axis
of the Earth used to be straight

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.689 align:middle line:90%
and it knocked it to 14 degrees.

00:09:30.689 --> 00:09:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: And that's what
the Egyptians were mapping

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:10%
with the causeways in
front of the Great Pyramid

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:10%
and the second pyramid
being at 14 degrees.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems like
they had the ability

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:84%
to predict that there was
going to be a catastrophe.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.315 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding
from the text

00:09:46.315 --> 00:09:49.167 align:middle line:84%
is that there was
one in 17500, one

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:90%
in 58000 BC and another 13660.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.876 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we have
humankind at that time?

00:09:54.876 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.850 align:middle line:10%
It seems that
there was evidence.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:10%
And so this is a very big story
and I'm piecing it together

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:10%
in another series.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:10%
But if they knew--
and imagine that we

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.910 align:middle line:10%
were on a committee knowing
that within 50 years,

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:10%
there was going to be some
kind of an asteroid hit.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.447 align:middle line:10%
What would we do?

00:10:12.447 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:10%
Like, if we had to
preserve our technology--

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.760 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I'm going
deep under fast.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.885 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: Well, we had to
preserve our technology.

00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:10%
We wanted to save the people.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:10%
So could it be that there
was a worldwide colonization?

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:10%
And now, the other thing is
that we want a one right answer.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.744 align:middle line:10%
And so it was Santorini.

00:10:27.744 --> 00:10:28.410 align:middle line:10%
No, it was here.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:10%
No, it was there.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: Well, what if
it was all of the above?

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And so Plato did speak a lot
about different characteristic

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:84%
features of Atlantis
but there is nowhere

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about that has come up

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:90%
with all of the features.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you see documentaries
on Atlantis, they'll say,

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.732 align:middle line:84%
well, there was no
evidence of elephants.

00:10:47.732 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:10%
Well, there couldn't have
been elephants in Santorini

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:10%
so it can't be Atlantis.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:51.564 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:51.564 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But you see the
shape of the circular cities.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But if we compare our
cities, LA, New York,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.886 align:middle line:84%
we build our cities
the same way.

00:10:59.886 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And so why wouldn't they build
their cities the same way?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So if they were worldwide
seafaring, they could come in.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The boats could come in,
go around the circle,

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.849 align:middle line:84%
drop off their cargo,
continue, pick up more cargo,

00:11:10.849 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:90%
and go out the other way.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:10%
So it was this continuous way
that there would be these round

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.184 align:middle line:10%
circles and they have found
them in several places

00:11:17.184 --> 00:11:18.766 align:middle line:10%
and Santorini is a
candidate for that.

00:11:18.766 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting, OK.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.506 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: Yeah.

00:11:20.506 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:10%
So it could be that
they went and colonized

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.440 align:middle line:10%
all these different places
and then built pyramids.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.171 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's making
a lot of sense now.

00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the pyramids,
a lot of the pyramids

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:84%
were built because of
the stars and the way

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:90%
the constellations were.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a quick look.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.820 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>The rituals of
ancient Egyptians

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:90%
were dictated by the stars.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
For example, the ancients
tracked the movement

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:84%
of the most prominent star
in the night sky, Sirius.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Through watching night after
night, season after season,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:84%
they realized that this star
would drop below the horizon

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and remain out of sight
for 70 days each year.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Its return was awaited
with anticipation

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.755 align:middle line:84%
because it coincided with
the flooding of the Nile.

00:12:11.755 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I'm just
amazed at how the ancients just

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
understood this, kept
track of things like this,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:90%
like the star system, Sirius.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And wasn't that the star system
where the Dogon tribe claimed

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
dual binary star

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.904 align:middle line:84%
system that we never found out
about until much, much later?

00:12:30.904 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Yeah, it's
really quite fascinating

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and the field of
archeoastronomy is really

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.280 align:middle line:90%
gaining strides in this.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:84%
But I've made a discovery with
the "band of peace," I call it,

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
from Abu Rawash, which
would align with Sirius.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked in
Starry Night Pro

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
to see which star system goes
with which set of pyramids.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems that
Abu Rawash is Sirius

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and Robert Bauval gave us
that Orion would be Giza.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But then, the Pleiades--
that's in "The Pyramid Code,"

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
as well-- could
have been Abusir.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you keep going,
Cygnus would be Dahshur.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was I worked
with the Extragalactic Grid

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
in the program,
Starry Night Pro.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And do you know that this
configuration holds together

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and if you keep going through
the spinal cord of Cygnus,

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.170 align:middle line:84%
the bird, you come to
the galactic center?

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But this configuration doesn't
fall apart all the way back

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.789 align:middle line:90%
to 33000 BC--

00:13:25.789 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were good--

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.246 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And all
the way forward

00:13:28.246 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:90%
to 13500 or something AD.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But I never figured
out what Saqqara is

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and so I've tried many,
many different star

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.170 align:middle line:90%
systems in there.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And they blow out.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Like if you run the movie back
and forward, if it's wrong,

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't stay in
that configuration.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:84%
That means they
understood something

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:90%
from outside the galaxy.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.352 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without telescopes.

00:13:48.352 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Well--

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.601 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We think
without telescopes.

00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, they
have found lenses.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.696 align:middle line:84%
They found lenses
but the thing is

00:13:53.696 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
is that there's evidence of
them using diamond drill bits.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.422 align:middle line:84%
But go find the bit
after two world floods.

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: You may not find it.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean they didn't
have sophisticated equipment.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.301 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, Michael
Cremo believes,

00:14:05.301 --> 00:14:09.230 align:middle line:84%
of course, that humankind
is much older, maybe

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
100 million years older,
and that civilizations

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
were obliterated or catastrophes
occurred and just wiped out

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:84%
any remnants of who
or what they were.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, that could
explain some of the technology.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Absolutely.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
evidence would be gone.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I just spoke at a conference
with Michael Cremo, the Modern

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge Tour.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.101 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great guy.

00:14:32.101 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Yeah but he has
existed in a bit of isolation

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and mainstream
archaeology doesn't

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.750 align:middle line:90%
want to go along with that.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And so there's-- but it doesn't
mean that the evidence that

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:90%
he's found isn't true.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we really,
really have to think

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:90%
in much much, much older terms.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of
course, the pyramids

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
could be much, much older,
then, based on that.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>The Egyptians themselves,
in at least one stone tablet

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and one papyrus, tell the
story that ancient Egypt

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
is much, much older than the
Egyptologists think it is.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>Where the Great
Pyramid sits, I believe,

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:90%
is on a much more ancient site.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Under the Great
Pyramid to this day

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.360 align:middle line:84%
is the descending passage
in the subterranean chamber.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
very good evidence

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that that was carved
out in what we

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.120 align:middle line:90%
would call "predynastic" times.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:84%
That goes back to a
very ancient date.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Based on the hieroglyphics
that we have,

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
the second pyramid
was in many ways

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:84%
regarded as the primary
pyramid on the Giza Plateau.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Actually, from many angles
on the Giza Plateau,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:90%
the second pyramid is dominant.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:84%
The structure underneath
it or the base of it

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
was older than even
the Great Pyramid.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Carmen,
so they look old.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.500 align:middle line:90%
They look really old.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was noticing some of the
crumbling going on, of course.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I assume the pyramids,
when they were finally

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.106 align:middle line:84%
built and completed, it
was much smoother, right?

00:16:04.106 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And the Giza
Plateau was used as a quarry.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they built a lot
of the mosques in Cairo

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:84%
with the casing stones
and they took them off.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And there were actually more
pyramids there that disappeared

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they've been
damaged, for sure.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is a
puzzlement, isn't it?

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Yes and we
keep finding new research.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So lately, there's
been articles published

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:84%
by-- let me get the name
right-- Menachem Parkhomenko

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and they acknowledge
Klaus Dona's work

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and John Anthony
West and Robert Shaw

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:90%
for the redating of the Sphinx.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But now, they're
saying that it could

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%
have been the Calabrian
phase all the way back

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:90%
to 800,000 years ago.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.777 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 800,000.

00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:51.402 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: 800.

00:16:51.402 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.018 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
beginning to make

00:16:53.018 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:90%
Cremo's theory more palatable.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But when I first
started spending a lot of time

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:84%
inside the Sphinx and
around it, before they

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:84%
did the restoration, it was
like sand that just crumbled.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're suggesting that the
Sphinx was actually underwater.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:84%
Well, we talked
already in a radio show

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:84%
about the labyrinth of Egypt and
the huge depth of this place.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And we've been finding
maps, ancient maps,

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.249 align:middle line:90%
which are clues to something.

00:17:20.249 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Why would you make a map
if it didn't look like--

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If it didn't
lead you somewhere?

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.518 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Right.

00:17:24.518 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So Lake Morris, which
is still there now,

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:84%
which is absolutely huge,
could have gone all the way

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:36.660 align:middle line:84%
from Hawara to Giza, which would
have put the Sphinx underwater.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is just
Earth-shattering,

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.700 align:middle line:90%
mind-boggling, and--

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which tells you
the Sphinx is even older.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.070 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: Even
older and it seems

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:10%
like all of us, as we do more
research, are creeping back.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And so this archeomineralogy
is what they're using.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:90%
And so the jury's not out.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:84%
There still needs to
be more research done.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.239 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like the more we
dig, the older everything gets.

00:18:03.239 --> 00:18:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: It is amazing.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is and
the technology that

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:84%
was used-- can we build pyramids
today the way they built them

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well,
Valery Uvarov has

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
built a pyramid in
Tomsk, Russia and it

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.212 align:middle line:84%
has all the characteristic
features and people have

00:18:21.212 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous healings
in there and they're

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:90%
building a site of four more.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big is it?

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.398 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: It's not as
big as the Great Pyramid

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:30.830 align:middle line:84%
but his conviction is that
the size isn't what matters.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.280 align:middle line:90%
I forget now how tall it is.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
It's probably about a third
the size of the Great Pyramid.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.387 align:middle line:84%
And so yes and they're
using poured stone.

00:18:38.387 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:90%
And this is Joseph--

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poured stone.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: This is
Joseph Davidovits' work.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at the temple walls,

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.680 align:middle line:84%
you can see how there's
a structure underneath

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and they probably poured what
looked like frescoes that we

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:90%
thought were carved.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So over the years of looking
at pictures and going,

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to
notice that there's

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.547 align:middle line:84%
the same frescoes in
different places, which

00:18:57.547 --> 00:18:59.630 align:middle line:84%
speaks to the idea that
there could've been molds.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.213 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of course,
if they poured it,

00:19:01.213 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
they probably brought in
huge cement trucks, right?

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, trucks or
they talk about natron, which

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:90%
they used to dry out mummies.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.676 align:middle line:84%
And the number of days,
70 days, is when Sirius

00:19:11.676 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:90%
would be below the horizon.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.880 align:middle line:84%
That's how long it
took them to mummify

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and this material was
pulling the moisture out

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and they used that in
order to dry the stone.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is evidence that if
you pour stone or if you carve

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.230 align:middle line:84%
stone, that it doesn't-- you
can't tell the difference.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's Joseph
Davidovits' work.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:90%
And so that's how they did it.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:84%
They poured the casing stones
and it's almost like fondant

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.737 align:middle line:84%
icing, where you put
it on and it's liquid

00:19:36.737 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and then it hardens.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.673 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And that's
how they did it.

00:19:39.673 --> 00:19:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And they have a real crystal
pyrimidine at the top

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and I've got the photographs
of 14-foot crystals,

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:84%
quartz crystals that came from
Brazil, taller than the cons--

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.582 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 14 foot-- huge.

00:19:49.582 --> 00:19:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Taller than
the construction workers

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
but that what's needed is
the quartz under pressure.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.889 align:middle line:84%
And so they're building
pyramids now in Russia.

00:19:57.889 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:84%
We're interactive here,
Carmen, so let's go

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:90%
to a few phone calls for you.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm Sarah
in Madison, Wisconsin

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to ask Carmen
what her best-guess theory is

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.041 align:middle line:90%
on how the pyramids were built.

00:20:10.041 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Carmen, a
generic question,

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:84%
of course, but something that
we constantly talk about.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.645 align:middle line:90%
How were the pyramids built?

00:20:15.645 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, I think it
was high-level initiates that

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:90%
had-- they were engineers.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:90%
They were scientists.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.240 align:middle line:90%
They had a lot of skill.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that it
was slaves dragging stones

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:84%
on rollers because they tried
that and it didn't work.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So I think that they were using
sound and light technology.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:84%
I have visions of two different
devices, lifters and nudgers

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and that they would work
fields within fields.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.712 align:middle line:84%
And so there'd be groups of
high-level initiates working

00:20:42.712 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
with the sound and
light technology

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and they would literally
be picking up the stones

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.590 align:middle line:84%
with an anti-gravity something
that worked with that.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've just come back
from filming at Coral Castle.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ah, and
Ed Leedskalnin once

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.512 align:middle line:84%
said he knew the secrets of
how the pyramids were built.

00:20:57.512 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Right.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we filmed
and he has-- it has

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:90%
to do with magnetic resonance.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And he actually used these
little magnets, it seems,

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and he's got a device that
is not unlike those crystal

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.730 align:middle line:90%
bowls at Abu Ghraib.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems that it
was somewhat mechanical,

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.274 align:middle line:84%
like there's a room
of tools that he used.

00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he kept
everything secret right

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:90%
until his death.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:84%
But he definitely
understood something,

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:84%
that it's plausible, not within
the context that we think

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
of things but if you can let
yourself go into another time

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and space and different value
system and different energy

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:84%
fields, I think they were
able to levitate the stones.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we experimenting
with that kind of magnetics

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:84%
now to see if we
can even do that?

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Yes and if you go
online and search on YouTube,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:84%
you can see all kinds of
things that are being suspended

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:90%
through different fields.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it is possible and I've
always thought that, actually.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they create
a field around whatever

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:84%
object you want to move and
it just kind of like floats,

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Well, it floats.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It's riding on sound waves.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
There's sound, there's
light technology,

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's somehow interfacing
with the molecules

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.965 align:middle line:90%
of the object.

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But then, there's
the other thing

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:84%
of taking frames and actually
pouring stone like concrete

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.665 align:middle line:84%
and then removing the frame and
moving along and continuing.

00:22:21.665 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's go to another call.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:24.768 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi, Carmen.

00:22:24.768 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:84%
My name is Brett and
I live in New Jersey.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know if you
think it was possible

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians used some
kind of wheel pulley device

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:90%
to build the pyramids.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: If you look at
Edward Leedskalnin's tool room,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
he got a lot of his
equipment from trains,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.850 align:middle line:90%
from railway yards.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are all
kinds of pulleys there.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And so he had devices that
would allow for leverage.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.457 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had a big
triangular tripod pulley.

00:22:50.457 --> 00:22:52.165 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Three of
them but the thing is

00:22:52.165 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:84%
is that he built two stories
on the site and everything

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:84%
was higher than the tripods
that he was working with

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and I've got
photographs of that.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
combination of all of it.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
pulleys perhaps could

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.840 align:middle line:84%
have been used but I think
it's a little bit more

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:90%
magical than that.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.999 align:middle line:90%
I think they had abilities.

00:23:09.999 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:84%
The most amazing
part for me, Carmen,

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
is the lost technology,
the lost knowledge,

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:23.620 align:middle line:84%
as if something so catastrophic
happened where none of this

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:90%
was passed on to us.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we see pyramids and
we're finding pyramids

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But the technology
of what happened--

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:90%
how to build them-- it's gone.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.760 align:middle line:90%
There's no transition.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Life is a transition.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:42.510 align:middle line:84%
We know that when we
landed on the moon in 1969,

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:84%
you can catalog what
happened and how

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:90%
we got there, where we are.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:90%
This is gone.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:90%
There's a separation.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:84%
What do you think happened
with that separation?

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, we
have to think, too,

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
of the patriarchy as
it exists right now

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and the influence
of 6,000 years.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why Michael Cremo
has had a lot of trouble

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.524 align:middle line:84%
because everything was supposed
to have happened in 6,000 years

00:24:08.524 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
that's possible.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, not at all.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.758 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But I've always
said that the agenda

00:24:12.758 --> 00:24:15.540 align:middle line:84%
of the patriarchy has been to
erase evidence of everything

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:90%
other than itself.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got
the witch trials

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and we've got-- if you had
any idea about tarot or herbs

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.260 align:middle line:84%
or any of those,
they'd burn you.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, once they
finished that, they

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:84%
went into the missions and then
they'd go to other countries.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been a
lot-- a concerted effort

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to erase all of this
information and to have

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.020 align:middle line:84%
anybody who thinks outside
the box be chastised

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and conspiracy theories
and all that, which

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:90%
is just a catch-all phrase.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But I think there are
fragments of the technology

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.700 align:middle line:84%
and the answers but
they're not accepted

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:84%
because we've got a
different value system now.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Erased?

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Erased or did they put it in
the Hall of Records somewhere?

00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Well, there you go.

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.327 align:middle line:84%
And if it was us,
knowing that there

00:25:02.327 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
was going to be a
disaster, what would

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:05.030 align:middle line:90%
we do with the technology?

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:90%
What would we do with the stuff?

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're finding
is older is-- well,

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:84%
we know in archaeology
that older's deeper

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and there are some very,
very deep reservoirs of we

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.800 align:middle line:90%
don't know what.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.090 align:middle line:84%
But Klaus Dona's got this
scanning technology that

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.740 align:middle line:84%
goes six kilometers
into the Earth

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.800 align:middle line:84%
but it's a 3D map
of 20 meters down

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and 40 meters down that
is logarithms working off

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.980 align:middle line:84%
live satellite feeds now that
Klaus Dona has access to.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the
sophisticated technology

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.720 align:middle line:90%
is now being verified.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And so in Egypt,
they've decided to do

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.584 align:middle line:84%
scans of two pyramids at
Dahshur and two at Giza.

00:25:42.584 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
That just is a
recent announcement

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.090 align:middle line:90%
in the last two weeks.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
sophisticated technology.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.910 align:middle line:90%
That only goes four feet deep.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got to
really understand

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:90%
what is available to us now.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.990 align:middle line:84%
But other countries
seem to be more

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:84%
open to going and investigating
what these scans have shown.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So Klaus has told me they've
scanned 200 sacred sites.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But then, you
don't go and verify it

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the
countries won't allow that.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But he's just come out
of the Philippines.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
They found some--
it's top secret still

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.770 align:middle line:84%
but they're finding
things and they're going

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and digging and
X marks the spot.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:23.002 align:middle line:84%
And where he says and what
depth and what the elements are

00:26:23.002 --> 00:26:24.450 align:middle line:90%
are being verified.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So as time goes by, the
validity of these tests

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.225 align:middle line:90%
are getting stronger.

00:26:29.225 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Edgar Cayce, the
great American prophet,

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.940 align:middle line:84%
once said that the
Hall of Records

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.710 align:middle line:84%
were contained in three areas,
somewhere in Central America,

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:84%
somewhere around the
Bimini area, and then

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:90%
the base of the Sphinx.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that if we can
get down there, we can find out.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think that Zahi
Hawass has already dug it up

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:84%
before he was ousted
as head of antiquities

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.487 align:middle line:84%
and knows what was in
that Hall of Records.

00:26:58.487 --> 00:26:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Well, I--

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a guess.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: There's a
certain amount of denial

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.540 align:middle line:84%
that goes on with all of
that because he insists

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:90%
that there's nothing at Hawara.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But I've also just
come back from Bimini

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.122 align:middle line:84%
and we had underwater cameras
and we filmed the Bimini Road

00:27:10.122 --> 00:27:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and there is a lot of
interesting energy there.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something's
going on there.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: But what I found
the most interesting of that--

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.420 align:middle line:84%
we took a cruise ship
to go over with my crew

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and no one on the boat knew
anything about the Bimini Road.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's like the collective,
where it's not acceptable.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:84%
The collective doesn't accept
the Bosnian pyramids, either.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.462 align:middle line:84%
But everyone on the
island knew all about it.

00:27:29.462 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all know.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Yeah and there
was a kid from Montreal who

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:84%
actually had a boat
who took us out there

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:90%
and we actually filmed.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:90%
And there's something to it.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:84%
But you can't just
say that Bimini's

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.045 align:middle line:90%
the only place, like you say.

00:27:43.045 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
there's three areas.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.554 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: There's
more places than one

00:27:45.554 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:84%
that would have had
some of these records.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But looking at the idea of Lake
Morris and Hawara being close

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and there being only water
between Giza and Hawara,

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.820 align:middle line:84%
which we still have
to investigate,

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
but that speaks to this
idea that maybe it's

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:84%
beneath-- in front of
the paws of the Sphinx

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.595 align:middle line:84%
but at a distance, across
a body of water-- could be.

00:28:07.595 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And so I'm starting
to warm up to the idea

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:17.040 align:middle line:84%
that the records could be
near a different pyramid, not

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:17.790 align:middle line:90%
the Great Pyramid.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That'd be interesting.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And that's all
that researchers have to say,

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.392 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid when
it's a different pyramid.

00:28:22.392 --> 00:28:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, everybody goes
running to look there.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.944 align:middle line:84%
And I have to admit, I spent
five years doing field work

00:28:26.944 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:84%
around the Great Pyramid looking
in and out of the tunnels

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
because I figured there
was something down there

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and there is.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:90%
There's--

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what's amazing,
too, Carmen, is over the years,

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:84%
over the millennia, how the
planet covers things up.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.481 align:middle line:90%
My gosh.

00:28:40.481 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: That's right.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.802 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could be
hundreds of feet down there.

00:28:43.802 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, and you
think that scuba diving only

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.752 align:middle line:90%
started in 1954.

00:28:47.752 --> 00:28:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, there
are things that are

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:84%
so deep off the coast
of Cuba that you can't

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.290 align:middle line:90%
send a human, no matter what.

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:84%
It has to be
submersibles that go

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're finding
structures down there.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And so once we start
putting all this together,

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:84%
it's a much bigger picture,
it's a much older picture,

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:90%
and it's a connected picture.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And so in a couple of
weeks, I'm going to Java

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and there's several points that
Plato talked about, elephants,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.020 align:middle line:84%
the fact that they had
dolphins, what they ate,

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.820 align:middle line:84%
the fruit the seasons, the
harvests, the waterways,

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.770 align:middle line:90%
And there's charts now.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Danny Iwato has made
them and Danny Hillman,

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.390 align:middle line:90%
who's an archaeologist.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And Santorini has a
certain number of them

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and other places have a
certain number of them.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.569 align:middle line:84%
But in Java, every single
point is verifiable.

00:29:35.569 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's listen in
on another question.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My name is
Mary and I heard a theory

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.595 align:middle line:84%
that ancient aliens
were involved

00:29:42.595 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:84%
in the building of
the Great Pyramid.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.951 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that's possible?

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, of course, I've
been on the History Channel's

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.470 align:middle line:84%
"Ancient Aliens" program
for eight years now

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.405 align:middle line:84%
and that's always
been a great theory.

00:29:54.405 --> 00:29:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, Hakim,
who's the indigenous wisdom

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.170 align:middle line:84%
keeper in "The
Pyramid Code," says

00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:90%
we didn't need it to be aliens.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, perhaps, we were connecting
with higher-level beings

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.710 align:middle line:84%
that were disincarnate,
that sort of thing.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But in a way, it's
too easy an answer.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that it
really was high-level,

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:14.640 align:middle line:84%
well-developed people with
abilities that were trained

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.140 align:middle line:90%
that--

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From this planet?

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.857 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: Yes but when you
start thinking about it,

00:30:18.857 --> 00:30:20.440 align:middle line:10%
when you're "Beyond
Belief" and you're

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:10%
open to different things,
we're all star seed.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:10%
Where did the first
of us come from?

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.985 align:middle line:10%
And so in a way,
we're the aliens.

00:30:28.985 --> 00:30:31.170 align:middle line:84%
We've traveled-- it's
a difficult concept

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.110 align:middle line:84%
to talk about because
the collective says

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.560 align:middle line:90%
no to all of it.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
it was spaceships

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and little gray beings that
were building the pyramids.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:41.700 align:middle line:90%
I just don't think that.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened,
Carmen, this catastrophe

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.300 align:middle line:90%
that occurred on the planet?

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably been
numerous catastrophes.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But when they talk about
the deluge, the flood,

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:57.189 align:middle line:84%
and the sinking of Atlantis,
you think it was that asteroid?

00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well,
like I said, there's

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:84%
three different
disasters and they

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:04.220 align:middle line:84%
caused huge tsunamis and the
cracking of the continents.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that would erase
a lot of evidence.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, I think that there
was an impact on the Earth

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and that it shook things
and changed the water levels

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.582 align:middle line:90%
and we're seeing that.

00:31:13.582 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:90%
And there's evidence of that.

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But this
was huge, wasn't it?

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.396 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Huge,
the whole planet.

00:31:17.396 --> 00:31:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, there was just a few
people, perhaps, that survived.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.500 align:middle line:10%
And so when you think of
the "cave to the swimmers"

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:10%
from "The English Patient"
and there's a high plateau

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.750 align:middle line:10%
called Gilf Kebir in Egypt.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And it could be that a few
people survived and swam

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.204 align:middle line:84%
and pulled themselves
up onto the plateau

00:31:34.204 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and then started again
with the markers.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you think about
Ireland and the British Isles

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and different water
levels, as well,

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:84%
there seems to have been
a frenetic amount of stone

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:90%
circle-building.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And James Swagger out
of Ireland talks about

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that and that 75% or
something of the stone circles

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.370 align:middle line:90%
on the planet are in Ireland.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And so we were
talking and it seemed

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.620 align:middle line:84%
like there was an
urgency and it's

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:84%
almost as though the
survivors of Atlantis

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.630 align:middle line:84%
were trying to put
the records back.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's come up with all
kinds of archeoastronomical

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.420 align:middle line:90%
alignments of tracking things.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they were seafaring
and they had the stars

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.732 align:middle line:84%
and they had their
boats, they would have

00:32:14.732 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:90%
to have understood the stars.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And so
this whole mechanism

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.150 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps was
destroyed and went down

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:26.900 align:middle line:84%
could have been charted back in
that area using stone circles.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was an
old movie of Atlantis

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.500 align:middle line:84%
that dealt with a massive
crystal that they had.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was a weapon
or what, I don't know.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Do you think they possess
that kind of technology?

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, the legend is
Lake Titicaca at 14,000 feet

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.225 align:middle line:84%
or so in Bolivia,
saltwater lake--

00:32:50.225 --> 00:32:53.280 align:middle line:84%
the local people
that have been there

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.894 align:middle line:84%
think that the Atlantean
crystal's down there.

00:32:55.894 --> 00:32:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yes and then--

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.814 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why would
they say that?

00:32:58.814 --> 00:33:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, who knows
where all that started?

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think there
would have been more than one.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And so right where
the Bimini Road--

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.720 align:middle line:84%
they call it "Paradise
Point" or something--

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:84%
is the center of the Bermuda
Triangle and all kinds

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.334 align:middle line:90%
of shipwrecks, compasses going--

00:33:16.334 --> 00:33:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything haywire.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Everything
haywire and so

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that would have been
another central point.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we use crystals
in everything now.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Crystals are in ethernet cables.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.360 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And so again,
they're teeny tiny.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But if you can
imagine huge crystals

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.171 align:middle line:84%
and what they could have
done to the energy fields,

00:33:35.171 --> 00:33:36.670 align:middle line:84%
it starts to make
sense, doesn't it?

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure does.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:38.111 align:middle line:90%
It sure does.

00:33:38.111 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And add to it, though, the
extraterrestrial presence,

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:84%
which you're not
too convinced of.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But let's assume for a
moment that they came here,

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.900 align:middle line:84%
they helped us, they
provided information,

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.660 align:middle line:84%
they provided knowledge,
they provided the ability

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.560 align:middle line:84%
to anti-gravity these
blocks of stones,

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and then they just took it
back with them and left.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Now, it's not
that I'm opposed to the idea

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.080 align:middle line:90%
but it's unverifiable.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And so everything I
do, I want it grounded

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.730 align:middle line:90%
in something that's real.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.199 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're in science.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:11.865 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Yeah.

00:34:11.865 --> 00:34:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't prove
that and so that's

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.090 align:middle line:90%
why I don't make a claim to it.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that, of course,
I've been looking

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.330 align:middle line:84%
at things about UFOs
since I was a little kid

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.449 align:middle line:84%
and so been quite
convinced about it.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:28.019 align:middle line:84%
But how they interfaced
with us, what they left--

00:34:28.019 --> 00:34:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and the other thing
is that we're all

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
driving in our vehicles
and our little skateboards

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.389 align:middle line:84%
and everything and so we assume
that they're all in spaceships.

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:35.389 align:middle line:90%
But they can shapeshift.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:36.054 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:34:36.054 --> 00:34:37.929 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: So they can
just be walking around

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:39.637 align:middle line:84%
and take over someone's
body for a while.

00:34:39.637 --> 00:34:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of ways
that are unexplained

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's a big challenge
to try to explain it.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not against the
idea but I don't claim it

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:90%
because I can't verify it.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
drives you, Carmen?

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Past life
memories-- I know things

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.430 align:middle line:90%
that I have no business knowing.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:01.059 align:middle line:90%
And so I--

00:35:01.059 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are those
past life memories

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.084 align:middle line:90%
drawing you into all this?

00:35:04.084 --> 00:35:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Absolutely
and I had evidence of 85

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.070 align:middle line:84%
of my own past lives
by the time I was 33.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 85.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: And then,
I stopped counting.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I think I'm just
going and picking up

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.039 align:middle line:90%
bits of what I knew before.

00:35:15.039 --> 00:35:16.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe you
were Cleopatra.

00:35:16.455 --> 00:35:19.189 align:middle line:90%


00:35:19.189 --> 00:35:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: She came
much later in the game.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
we go in the future?

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.760 align:middle line:84%
What's the next few
years going to do for us?

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Well, that's
a very good question.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.557 align:middle line:84%
I think we need a model
for an empowered humanity

00:35:29.557 --> 00:35:31.015 align:middle line:84%
because everything
about patriarchy

00:35:31.015 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
is disconnect, disempower, power
over, and that sort of thing.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.194 align:middle line:90%
How can we empower ourselves?

00:35:37.194 --> 00:35:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
religion was doing

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:84%
is give your power
to the priest,

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:41.720 align:middle line:90%
all these different things.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So how can we come
to our own truth?

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And in our society right
now, truth is an option

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and people stand up and say,
it's true because I said so.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.308 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Right?

00:35:51.308 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And the news and teachers
and movies and all that stuff

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:84%
is giving us-- feeding us
these ideas that disconnect us.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So if we can leave that
and not drink the Kool-Aid

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and come back into
our own deep knowing,

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.926 align:middle line:84%
I think that we
will address values

00:36:06.926 --> 00:36:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that have more to do
with consciousness

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.640 align:middle line:90%
instead of profit.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people watch
"The Pyramid Code" and "The New

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis" DVD that
you're working on?

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.880 align:middle line:10%
>>BOULTER: "The Pyramid Code"
is on Vimeo on pay-per-view

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.680 align:middle line:10%
and we've spent a lot of
time taking it off YouTube

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.920 align:middle line:10%
because it was all over that.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.330 align:middle line:10%
It's on Netflix
and Hulu, as well.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:29.899 align:middle line:10%
And "The New Atlantis" should
be finished by July of next year

00:36:29.899 --> 00:36:31.440 align:middle line:10%
and we'll be doing
pre-sales of that.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:90%
Good luck, Carmen.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BOULTER: Thank you.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.774 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:36:34.774 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BOULTER: Thanks
so much, George.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The pyramids-- the
next time you look at a story

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.960 align:middle line:10%
or see it on television and
think about how were they

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:10%
constructed, how
were they built,

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.490 align:middle line:10%
just think about this
and this discussion

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:10%
because it's very
possible sound resonance

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.880 align:middle line:10%
did that with technology
that we have simply lost.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.516 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
