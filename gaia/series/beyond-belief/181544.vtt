>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEOGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.880 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:10%
And our special guests today
will be John Martineau.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:84%
He's a British philosopher
and a publisher,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:84%
including his book "A
Little Book of Coincidence

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.910 align:middle line:90%
in the Solar System."

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:90%
John, welcome to the show.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN MARTINEAU: Thanks
very much for having me.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
interested in the solar system?

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little
bit more about you.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEAU: Right.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:10%
That really begins
with my grandfather,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.490 align:middle line:10%
who's called Anthony Ashton.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:10%
And he was very interested
in the anthropic principle,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:10%
as it was then known
in the 1970s, which

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:10%
was when the problem of
the finely tuned universe

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.932 align:middle line:10%
first came along.

00:00:59.932 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I went to live in
Wales, quite near to him,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and we used to go and
walk the dogs every day

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:90%
on the Welsh borders.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And he would describe
this problem to me.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And I became quite hooked
and very interested in it.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was a genius.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: He was just
following the work of others

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.196 align:middle line:84%
really, but he had
some ideas of his own

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:18.300 align:middle line:84%
which I think I've been
able to develop slightly.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, I'm not a
believer in coincidence.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I think everything
happens for a reason.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:90%
And you do too, don't you?

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Yes, I
think coincidences is

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:90%
a much maligned word actually.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.720 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, science
is built on coincidences.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So if something happens once,
no one takes any notice.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
If it happens twice,
three times, four times,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:90%
then you've got a pattern.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And science is the study
of patterns in nature.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.062 align:middle line:84%
And a coincidence
is simply two things

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:84%
happening at the beginning
of a pattern, if you like.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of those words that,
if you really think about it,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:84%
it's got a lot more embedded in
it than it's throwaway meaning.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, tell us a
little bit about your "Book

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:90%
of Coincidence."

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: My "Little
Book of Coincidence"

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:84%
which was published in 2001
now, quite a long time ago,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:84%
was simply an attempt to look
at the geometry and harmony

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:90%
of the solar system.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen a plate in a book by
a chap called Joachim Schultze.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And he published a picture
of the motions of Venus

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth, this
lovely pentagonal picture

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.170 align:middle line:84%
which I think we may
be coming to later.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was really taken by it.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to
study it some more,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
try and find out what other
geometries and harmonies there

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:90%
were in the solar system.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.002 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually
published all my findings

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
in this book, "Little
Book of Coincidence

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:90%
in the Solar System."

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things I
discovered at that time

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:84%
are now very well
understood, particularly

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.336 align:middle line:84%
with the recent discoveries of
lots of other solar systems,

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:50.460 align:middle line:90%
exoplanetary solar systems.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're all
the same, aren't they?

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.336 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: They've all
got these resonances.

00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:55.195 align:middle line:84%
In fact, resonances
seems to be built in.

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But the particular ones that
we've got going around Earth

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.528 align:middle line:90%
are very, very special.

00:02:58.528 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things that I've carried on

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.670 align:middle line:90%
with looking at in my work.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
things, I think,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.168 align:middle line:84%
that presently my "Little
Book of Coincidences"

00:03:08.168 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:90%
have not been explained.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you will be able to
talk about those a little bit

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.514 align:middle line:90%
more in this program.

00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is geometry
so important in the scheme

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:90%
of things?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Well, that's
a very good question.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
My publishing
house, Wooden Books,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.900 align:middle line:84%
we've been publishing the
seven liberal arts, all seven

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of the seven liberal
arts, in two volumes

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:90%
now for a few years.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:10%
We just last year
published the "Trivium,"

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:10%
which is logic, rhetoric,
grammar, poetic meter,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:10%
and form.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And the book we did before
that was called "Quadrivium."

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And that was the book on
numbered geometry, harmony,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and my contribution on
geometry and harmony

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:90%
in the solar system.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to
the ancient Greeks,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and we look at why they thought
these subjects were important,

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
you can see that they were
called the liberal arts

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
because they were supposed to
liberate a person, as opposed

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.042 align:middle line:84%
to the servile arts which
had a function, if you like.

00:03:59.042 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So servile arts might have been
something like accountancy.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Or anything that had a
real use in the world

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:90%
was one of the servile arts.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:84%
But liberal arts alone
have no real use,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:84%
as such, according to the
Greeks were seeing it any way.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.280 align:middle line:84%
They are, in fact, quite
useful for building things.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, they help you
understand the way that number

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:90%
operates in the world.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So particularly with
geometry, you've

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
got the fact that number
in space is geometry,

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and you've number
in time as harmony.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to be so
much order to the universe.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what baffles me--

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
how the principles stay the
same throughout the entire--

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the order
of the universe

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely brilliant.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Who developed this?

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: The order of the
universe is quite brilliant.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:84%
The thing about the
order of our universe

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
is that it is
very, very special.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.430 align:middle line:90%
That brings us on to the--

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unique or special?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Well, it is
unique because we have only

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:90%
got the one universe to study.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:90%
But it is also doubly special.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.569 align:middle line:84%
And what scientists began
to realize in the 1970s,

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:84%
particularly with the
publication of a book

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:84%
called "The Cosmological
Anthropic Principle,"

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
an early work by a chap
called Brandon Carter,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:84%
was that our universe is
very, very, very finely tuned

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:84%
to optimize the chances
for biological life.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And the more scientists
have looked at the universe,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:84%
the more eerie and strange
this fine tuning has seemed.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, people thought
they could just explain it away

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:90%
as a series of coincidences.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:84%
But now, and particularly in the
last 15 years as more and more

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and more of these fine
tunings have been discovered,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
it begs the question of what's
caused these fine tunings.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
How did our universe come
into being absolutely,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
completely, and utterly
optimized all of its dials

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:90%
fine-tuned.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
say it's perfect?

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: It is pretty much
as perfect as you can get it.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can show
lots of examples

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.109 align:middle line:84%
where if you fiddle
with any of the dials,

00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
you increase the
mass of the electron

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
or reduce the force of
gravity slightly or change

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.350 align:middle line:84%
any of nature's
constants in any way

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
really, that life as we know
it just really couldn't exist.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even that you
could get a universe really

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.381 align:middle line:90%
where very much happens at all.

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:90%
You might get no chemistry.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.687 align:middle line:84%
You'd have only hydrogen
or helium or just

00:06:20.687 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:84%
a universe of millions
of black holes.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've got it all.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: It is
so finely tuned.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of these parameters,
if you change them

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:33.356 align:middle line:84%
by a factor of naught point--
.000000000001, nothing works.

00:06:33.356 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:84%
They're really, really,
really, finely tuned.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.362 align:middle line:84%
Others have a range
that they work within.

00:06:38.362 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's find out a
little bit more about this.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yes.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:10%
>> From galaxies and stars,
down to atoms and subatomic

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:10%
particles, the very structure
of our universe is determined

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:10%
by these numbers.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:84%
These are the fundamental
constants and quantities

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.466 align:middle line:10%
Scientists have come to
the shocking realization

00:06:59.466 --> 00:07:01.340 align:middle line:10%
that each of these
numbers has been carefully

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:10%
dialed to an astonishingly
precise value, a value that

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:10%
falls within an exceedingly
narrow, life-permitting range.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
If any one of these numbers
were altered by even a hair's

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:84%
breadth, no physical
interactive life of any kind

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:90%
could exist anywhere.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:10%
There'd be no stars, no life,
no planets, no chemistry.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Consider gravity, for example.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
The force of gravity
is determined

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:90%
by the gravitational constant.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:84%
If this constant varied by
just 1 in 10 to the 60th parts,

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.110 align:middle line:90%
none of us would exist.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:84%
To understand how exceedingly
narrow this life permitting

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:84%
range is, imagine a dial divided
into 10 to the 60th increments.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:84%
To get a handle on how many
tiny points on the dial

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:84%
this is, compare it to the
number of cells in your body

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:84%
or the number of seconds that
have ticked by since time

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:90%
began.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
If the gravitational
constant had been out of tune

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:84%
by just one of these
infinitesimally small

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:84%
increments, the universe
would either have expanded

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and thinned out so rapidly
that no stars could form

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and life couldn't
exist, or it would

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:84%
have collapsed back on
itself with the same result--

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
no stars, no
planets, and no life.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Or consider the expansion
rate of the universe.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
This is driven by the
cosmological constant.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.585 align:middle line:84%
A change in its value by a mere
1 part in 10 to the 120th parts

00:08:31.585 --> 00:08:33.090 align:middle line:84%
would cause the
universe to expand

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:90%
too rapidly or too slowly.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.100 align:middle line:84%
In either case, the
universe would, again,

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:90%
be life-prohibiting.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Or another example
of fine tuning--

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:84%
if the mass and energy
of the early universe

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:84%
were not evenly distributed to
an incomprehensible precision

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
of 1 part in 10 to
the 10 to the 123rd,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
the universe would be
hostile to life of any kind.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, our
universe permits

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
physical interactive
life only because these

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and many other numbers have been
independently and exquisitely

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:90%
balanced on a razor's edge.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, what are
the odds of that happening?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: That was a
great clip, by the way.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: They are
really, really small.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
The latest book on
the subject, which

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:84%
is co-authored by
Geraint and Luke Barnes,

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
fantastic book published by
Cambridge University Press,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:84%
you just get the
sense of this thing

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.585 align:middle line:84%
being almost
impossibly unlikely.

00:09:28.585 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's unbelievable.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: It's unbelievable.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
It is beyond belief,
it really is.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Which then brings us to the
question of how it's achieved.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.992 align:middle line:90%
How does this come about?

00:09:40.992 --> 00:09:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because this
is not an accident.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:90%
This is not random.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: It's clearly
something going on here.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Some people think it is a
combination of randomness

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.362 align:middle line:90%
and infinity.

00:09:53.362 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I can't accept that.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: No, but it's
the standard response.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:84%
The problem is what they
call the multiverse.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And there are various
different kinds of multiverses.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Some are linear, and
they go on forever.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Some universes have babies.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Others pop out of a sort of
bathtub and they all connect.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, the
idea with those solutions

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to the problem of all
this beautiful fine tuning

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle line:84%
is that you've just gotten an
infinite number of universes.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.374 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
live in the one

00:10:19.374 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
where it's all
very, very perfect.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.395 align:middle line:84%
As I hope to show in a
moment, that doesn't really

00:10:24.395 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:84%
hold water when
we look at what's

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:90%
going on around the Earth.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Because although for life,
there's a necessary--

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ingredients.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU:
--necessary conditions,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.496 align:middle line:84%
what we see going around
the Earth is not necessary,

00:10:36.496 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:84%
but it still appears finely
tuned for beauty, in fact.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there are all sorts of
other solutions to the problem

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:84%
as well, which range from Elon
Musk's favorite belief on this

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.925 align:middle line:90%
is that we live in a simulation.

00:10:49.925 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So the reason
everything looks so

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.585 align:middle line:84%
beautiful is that it's
essentially a simulation.

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But who's
the simulator?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Exactly.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.553 align:middle line:84%
You get back to the problem
of who's the designer?

00:10:57.553 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Who's done it?

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.164 align:middle line:84%
Aliens built it is another
one, another big thing.

00:11:02.164 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And who built them?

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.496 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Who built them?

00:11:04.496 --> 00:11:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you've
got the God did it.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:84%
But if he did it,
how did he do it?

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And who built God?

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Always
was, always will be,

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
that's what my
mother used to say.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And I used to say, Mom,
that's not an answer.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: That's right.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:90%
None of them are really answers.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And we are in this
very interesting point

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
in cosmology at the moment
that a lot of the cosmologists

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:90%
don't really want to talk about.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But it has real echoes
of a particular period

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:84%
in the previous
cosmological journey

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:84%
that mankind took in the
medieval period, where

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.150 align:middle line:84%
the theologians of the
day, i.e. the scientists,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:84%
would argue about
the number of angels

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:90%
that could dance on a pinhead.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And these debates were
taken very, very seriously.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest
minds of the day

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:90%
then would discuss these things.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.010 align:middle line:84%
We have exactly the
same problem now

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:84%
that our greatest
thinkers are all

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
coming up with these
extraordinary ideas, very few

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:90%
of which--

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.295 align:middle line:84%
in fact, none of
which-- can ever

00:12:03.295 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:84%
be tested, which we are
all asked to believe in.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they don't even
agree with one another,

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:84%
because each scientist has their
own pet theory, none of which

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.305 align:middle line:90%
can be tested.

00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a very interesting
period in cosmology.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to be able to
show a way through this

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:90%
or another take on it.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
your gut tell you?

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Well, that
maybe brings us to the Earth.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And what I did
when I was studying

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:84%
this subject was
begin to notice--

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.430 align:middle line:84%
it was a result of my "Little
Book of Coincidence," which

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I really only wrote to
complete the seven books,

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:90%
the liberal arts project.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But there's certain things
in that journey that really

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:84%
stuck out like a sore thumb and
made me really scratch my head

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and think, what on
Earth is going on here?

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't really
fit in with any kind

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:90%
of necessary thing.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:84%
The first one of those
was this Venus thing

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:90%
that I touched on before.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And the odd thing about Venus
is she's our closest planet.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.510 align:middle line:84%
She's got the very,
very circular orbit.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like
anything's really

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.795 align:middle line:90%
seems to have disturbed her.

00:13:04.795 --> 00:13:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's too hot.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.364 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: She
spins the opposite way

00:13:07.364 --> 00:13:10.510 align:middle line:84%
to all the other bodies
in the solar system.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.995 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's a pretty
nasty place to try and live.

00:13:12.995 --> 00:13:14.620 align:middle line:84%
But the extraordinary
thing about Venus

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle line:84%
is that she goes around
the Earth in a pattern that

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.149 align:middle line:90%
is a five-fold pattern.

00:13:21.149 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So the pattern of Venus's
conjunctions around the Earth

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:84%
draw this beautiful rose-like
figure around the Earth.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.585 align:middle line:84%
And she does it
over eight years.

00:13:29.585 --> 00:13:31.751 align:middle line:84%
And the reason you get a
five, in fact, with Venus--

00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:33.490 align:middle line:84%
a five-fold pattern
around the Earth--

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
is because of an 8-13
resonance between the periods

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.910 align:middle line:90%
of Venus and the Earth.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.537 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And without that number
it wouldn't happen, would it?

00:13:42.537 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: That's right.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
If Venus and the Earth weren't
in an 8-13 resonance, then

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't get this 5.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even though it's
a very quite tight resonance,

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.060 align:middle line:84%
it's not really well studied
or examined by scientists.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.120 align:middle line:84%
They prefer to look at
the 5-to-2 resonance

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.546 align:middle line:90%
between Jupiter and Saturn.

00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
does that mean, John,

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:90%
when you talk about--

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: When
you've a resonance,

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.726 align:middle line:84%
it means for every five
times one planet goes around

00:14:05.726 --> 00:14:07.530 align:middle line:90%
the sun--

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.880 align:middle line:84%
so for Jupiter and Saturn,
for every five times

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that Jupiter goes around the
sun, Saturn's gone round twice.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.014 align:middle line:84%
So with an 8-13 resonance,
we've got for every 13 times

00:14:18.014 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Venus has gone around
the sun, Earth's done 8.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We go 8.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.646 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: And that's why
that 8-13, the number you

00:14:23.646 --> 00:14:25.270 align:middle line:84%
get in the petals as
viewed from Earth,

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
the number of the
conjunctions, is

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:90%
the difference in the harmony.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
if it was 9-13?

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: If it was
9-13, you'd get a 4,

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
because the difference
between 9 and 13 is 4.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.709 align:middle line:90%
So you'd get 4 petals.

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:84%
But the really interesting thing
about this choice of numbers

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
is that they're all
Fibonacci numbers.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So our solar system is
full of Fibonacci numbers.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And Fibonacci numbers
are very interesting,

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
because they're the numbers
that build life on Earth.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So take an example, if you count
the spirals on a pineapple,

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:84%
you'll get 5, 8, and
13 spirals, depending

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.580 align:middle line:84%
on which angle of slope
of a spiral you can count.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Take another example.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Human beings we have 5 teeth
in each corner of our mouth.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.420 align:middle line:90%
As kids, our infant teeth--

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We should.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah,
they come out.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.644 align:middle line:84%
And then you get 8 teeth in
each corner of your mouth.

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And that means
you've got 13 teeth

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:14.268 align:middle line:90%
in each corner of your mouth.

00:15:14.268 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Your teeth have gone 5, 8, 13.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.489 align:middle line:84%
All the plants around
you are doing 5, 8, 13.

00:15:19.489 --> 00:15:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How can this be?

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Life's
all doing 5, 8, 13.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the really
strange thing

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:84%
is that our closest
planet is doing 5, 8, 13.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Why would our closest
planet do 5, 8, 13 as well?

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't be.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a very strange coincidence.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason
that you should

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:84%
get the same numbers
being danced out

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
by your closest planet as the
prevailing numbers that fit.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Someone has designed
this for a specific reason.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: It looks uncanny.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
It's something very
strange going on with it.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.751 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can
they say it's random?

00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Because
there's no causal mechanism

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:84%
known to science that
could bring that about.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the Venus thing
is a double coincidence.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you've got
a very beautiful Fibonacci

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.210 align:middle line:84%
resonance going on, which
in itself is interesting.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But the fact you've
got that going on

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
around the only planet
of biological life

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.230 align:middle line:84%
that embodies those same
numbers is a double coincidence.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And the double coincidences are
where they start to stack up.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Another example of double
coincidences, for me,

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
is the simple fact that
the sun and moon appear

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.272 align:middle line:90%
the same size in the sky.

00:16:25.272 --> 00:16:26.355 align:middle line:90%
It's one of those really--

00:16:26.355 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: --obvious facts.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.410 align:middle line:90%
You see that during an eclipse.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're right.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:90%
They look like quarters.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.971 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: They're
exactly the same size.

00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:35.294 align:middle line:84%
They are really,
really the same size.

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:84%
They weren't always
the same size.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
In the time of the
dinosaurs, the moon

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.030 align:middle line:90%
was closer to the Earth.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And she's been moving
further out as time gone by.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.137 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Inches
at a stage, right?

00:16:44.137 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: That's right.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But right now, at
exactly this time

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
when there are lots of
thinking, sentient beings

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.160 align:middle line:84%
on Earth with
telescopes and eyes

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.326 align:middle line:84%
and brains to think about it,
we live in a particular epoch

00:16:55.326 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
where we've got a sun
and moon the same size.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a double
coincidence, because it's not

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
only a coincidence
that we see it,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
but it's a coincidence that we
see it now, when we're here.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.141 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
interesting thing.

00:17:09.141 --> 00:17:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's one
of those things,

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
you thought, well, that's just
got to be chance, hasn't it?

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:90%
There's can't be any--

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.920 align:middle line:84%
how could you
possibly pull it off

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that you get a sun and moon
the same size at exactly

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.029 align:middle line:84%
the same time that there's
a whole sentient species

00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth--

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not chance.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:22.569 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: --to look at it.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a
trailer from a movie based

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:90%
on your book.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: That's right.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:84%
That's a movie that
never got made.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very happy to
share it with you.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But we
have the trailer.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at it.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.354 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: You've got some
bits from the trailer, yeah.

00:17:32.354 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But what we are about to show
you is the fact that few modern

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
scientists are even aware of
let alone able to explain.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Yet it is something well known
to their ancient colleagues

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and one of the most amazing
coincidences conceivable.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Seen from the modern viewpoint,
the planets of the solar system

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:90%
orbit the sun.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.430 align:middle line:84%
However, we do not
live on the sun.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:90%
We live here, on Earth.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we look towards
the sun from Earth,

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
what we actually see are
the inner planets, Mercury

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and Venus, whizzing
around the sun as the sun

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:90%
moves across the stars.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:84%
The sun is not the center
of our observations.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Does it not strike
you as odd to discover

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:18.670 align:middle line:84%
that, as seen from Earth, our
closest neighbor, Venus, draws

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
a huge fivefold rosette in
space around us in eight yards,

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:90%
or 13 Venusian years?

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Remember that most
plants on Earth

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:90%
use the numbers 5, 8, and 13.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, our closest
neighbor is massively

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:39.250 align:middle line:84%
beating out exactly these same
three numbers in space and time

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle line:84%
This diagram was known to Kepler
and other astronomers hundreds,

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.390 align:middle line:90%
even thousands, of years ago.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:10%
Yet, it does not appear in
any modern astronomy book.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:84%
In antiquity, there
was a concept known

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.150 align:middle line:90%
as the harmony of the spheres--

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
also a parallel notion
of as above, so below--

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:84%
used by architects to
bring cosmic proportions

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:90%
into their buildings.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:10%
Today, both traditions
have been largely replaced

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:10%
by beautiful complex
equations which perfectly

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:10%
describe the heavenly
motions and create computer

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:10%
models of their possessions.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Yet there are many simple
ways of understanding

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
the planetary orbits,
which are much more

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
practical and sensible for
everyday designers, artists,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:90%
builders, and musicians.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.520 align:middle line:84%
We have just seen what
Venus does around Earth.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Did you also know that each
time you pick up three, glasses

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
or push three oranges
together, you're

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.940 align:middle line:84%
drawing the average orbits of
the first two planets, Mercury

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:90%
and Venus--

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:84%
or that our two
neighbors, Venus and Mars,

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
play out a beautiful
3-to-4 rhythm

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.240 align:middle line:90%
in their close approaches to us?

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Has anyone ever told you
that Mercury plays a waltz

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:84%
all by itself, for one
Mercury day is two Mercury

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:84%
years, during which time
it is spun on its own axis

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:90%
exactly three times.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:90%
There are many more examples.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Yet few of these resonances are
understood by modern science.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:90%
So they're not taught in school.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And few people
today see the beauty

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
or hear the music
of the spheres.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.482 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John, how
long did it take

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.972 align:middle line:84%
you to decipher them and
come up with those formulas?

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: It
took a bit of time.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would think so.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: I was
working on that.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
quite old stuff now.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of that's even
slightly out of date,

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
because scientists do understand
some of these resonances now.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But they don't understand
other bits of it.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:84%
But yeah it's been
a long journey.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:90%
And the journey is not over yet.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell me the significance--
when you say one Mercury this,

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:84%
one Mercury-- what
does that mean to us--

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:84%
to a guy who doesn't
know anything about this.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.031 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Well,
what you've really

00:20:53.031 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:84%
got there is you've got a
kind of form of tidal locking,

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:90%
in fact, going on.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:90%
But it's also music.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:84%
What you're really
hearing is music.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:90%
So 1-to-2 is an octave.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it a rhythm?

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.666 align:middle line:90%
It's a rhythm and an octave.

00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:08.640 align:middle line:90%
So like that's a waltz.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.784 align:middle line:84%
1-to-2-to-3, you've got
an octave and fifth going

00:21:10.784 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:84%
on there, a musical
fifth. (SINGING) Baa, baa,

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.397 align:middle line:90%
black sheep.

00:21:14.397 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And you've got a waltz in there.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're seeing
the planets do that too?

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.685 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: It really is
the music of the spheres.

00:21:19.685 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks were right about
this a lot a long time ago.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in most of
the exoplanetary systems

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.880 align:middle line:84%
that the science
has been looking at,

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:84%
they're finding these
resonances everywhere now.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
I did, in fact,

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:38.830 align:middle line:84%
was recently I keyed in all
of the exoplanetary systems

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I could get data for, which
is quite a lot of them.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could write
a symphony from this.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.705 align:middle line:84%
You could do a
symphony from it, yeah.

00:21:45.705 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would
be interesting.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.121 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: And I looked
to see how many of them

00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I could find with
Fibonacci numbers as well.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And there weren't
very many out there.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So this thing going around
the Earth is doubly strange.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.824 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
importance of this order?

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Because somewhere
along the line there's

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:90%
got to be a reason for this--

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.710 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
that reason is?

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: So we've
got this Venus thing

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.835 align:middle line:84%
going on around the Earth that
really shouldn't be there.

00:22:14.835 --> 00:22:16.880 align:middle line:84%
It's very beautiful,
very meaningful, the fact

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.675 align:middle line:84%
our closest planet is doing the
same thing is all the plants.

00:22:19.675 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go on anywhere
else in the solar system

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:90%
I could find it.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: And then we got
our sun and moon the same size

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.870 align:middle line:90%
in the sky which is--

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: --very weird
and meaningful and lovely bit

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
of symmetry, shouldn't be
there, doesn't need to be there.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it is.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.318 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: But it is.

00:22:35.318 --> 00:22:37.704 align:middle line:84%
And then another thing I
discovered a few years ago

00:22:37.704 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:84%
was this strange thing about
ice halos, which you must see

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.605 align:middle line:90%
quite a lot of here in Boulder.

00:22:41.605 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I bet.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: It's
these beautiful things

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:44.986 align:middle line:84%
where you get a
couple of rainbows

00:22:44.986 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:90%
around the sun on an icy day.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered a
couple of years ago,

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:84%
my most recent discovery in
this vein, that the two rainbows

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:84%
you see around the sun, which
are known as the 22 degree

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:84%
halo and the 46
degree halo, exactly

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.280 align:middle line:84%
show you where mercury
and Venus's mean orbits

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:90%
are around the sun.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:90%
So when you see some sun dogs--

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:90%
each side of the sun--

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.890 align:middle line:90%
that's Mercury's mean orbit.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.724 align:middle line:84%
You're actually looking at it
drawn for you as a rainbow.

00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As a picture.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah, as a
picture, exactly really right.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.300 align:middle line:84%
If you could see Mercury
as a glittering object,

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:84%
it would be exactly
where the sun--

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is somebody trying
to tell us something?

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: And
then Venus, which

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:90%
is 46 degrees from the sun.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.430 align:middle line:90%
Venus is very circular.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Where that second halo
appears-- sorry to wave

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.690 align:middle line:84%
my arms around-- where
that second halo appears

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.340 align:middle line:84%
is exactly where
Venus's orbit is.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:90%
So what's the chances of that?

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
You've got our closest
planet doing the same numbers

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.410 align:middle line:90%
as life on Earth.

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:84%
We've got the only two
circles in the sky--

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.560 align:middle line:90%
the sun and the moon--

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:90%
the same size.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And we've got the
only other two circles

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.980 align:middle line:84%
we ever see in the sky, which
are these two ice halos,

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.160 align:middle line:84%
exactly mapping onto the orbits
of the two inner planets.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.074 align:middle line:84%
It's really deeply,
deeply strange.

00:23:55.074 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't be there.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:90%
None of this should be there.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it is.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: But it is.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So this just really brings
you closer to maybe wondering

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.287 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:24:05.287 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And what it begins to do, if you
take these things seriously--

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
these coincidences
that are going on

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:84%
around a planet of
conscious observers

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:84%
like ourselves-- is
it makes you realize

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:84%
that some of these other
solutions to the fine tuning

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:84%
problem can't be true, because
they wouldn't explain this.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Because this idea of
randomness and infinity

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.087 align:middle line:84%
that's pedalled as the solution
to the fine tuning problem--

00:24:28.087 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which you
and I don't accept.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.295 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: We don't
accept it anyway.

00:24:31.295 --> 00:24:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And nor does, in fact,
quite a lot of scientists.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Hawkings never liked
it because it's unprovable.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.047 align:middle line:90%
It defies Occam's razor.

00:24:38.047 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:84%
You're inventing lots
of stuff you can never

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:90%
see to solve a problem.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, according
to these people,

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
our own solar system
is so unlikely anyway.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.630 align:middle line:84%
The idea that it
would be unlikely

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and also produces extra stuff
that you don't even need,

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.070 align:middle line:84%
means that it can't just be
randomness and infinity that's

00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:90%
the solution.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:01.062 align:middle line:90%
Something else is going on.

00:25:01.062 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are you saying?

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTINEAU: Well, this is
where we introduce maybe John

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.350 align:middle line:10%
Wheeler and John Wheeler's
participatory anthropic

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:10%
principle.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.992 align:middle line:84%
Wheeler, who took over
Einstein's chair at Princeton,

00:25:11.992 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:84%
towards the end of
his life started

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:14.710 align:middle line:90%
to look at this problem.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And he came up with this idea
of a participatory anthropic

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:84%
principle, or the idea that
observers had something

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:24.591 align:middle line:90%
to do with the fine tuning.

00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:90%
So he was really saying that--

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The observer being who?

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Us?

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Being us, yes.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Wheeler's really saying all
you really need is observers

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:36.497 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
get the fine tuning.

00:25:36.497 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:84%
It's quite an interesting--
it's quite a difficult thing

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:90%
to explain.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.399 align:middle line:90%
But let's just go through it.

00:25:41.399 --> 00:25:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's look at
the Wheeler interview, OK?

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Let's look
at a Wheeler interview.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that will
make a little sense.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: What a treat.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN WHEELER: As a picture
to inspire a thought,

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't record an
experiment or a formula.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.090 align:middle line:90%


00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
There is the letter U. The
U starts with a thin stem,

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of the universe.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning, the
universe is small.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:84%
This stemmed U gets
fatter as we go up

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:90%
to this side of the letter.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point, it's
terminated by a big circle.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:90%
And there, there's an I sitting.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And that I is looking back to
the first days of the universe.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:33.280 align:middle line:84%
We ourselves can
get radiation today,

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and do get radiation today,
from the very early days

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:37.840 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But insofar as the
active observation

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
has anything to do with what
we do when we ascribe reality

00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:84%
to what we see, then we can say
this observer, who was brought

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:84%
into existence of the universe,
has by his acts of observation

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:13.747 align:middle line:84%
a part in bringing that
universe itself into being.

00:27:13.747 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: What a treat.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's not
around to explain

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:90%
what he was talking about.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: No.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Let's unpack it a bit.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:10%
So Wheeler took over
Einstein's chair in relativity.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:10%
He also worked with Niels Bohr.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.477 align:middle line:90%
He was the last guy to really--

00:27:27.477 --> 00:27:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of the true physicists.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:30.643 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: The true
physicists of that era

00:27:30.643 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
that weren't scared to
think outside the box.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.715 align:middle line:84%
And what he's really
saying in a nutshell is--

00:27:37.715 --> 00:27:39.340 align:middle line:84%
let's think of it in
Einsteinian terms.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.690 align:middle line:90%
He's talking about light.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we live in
something called spacetime post

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Einstein.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.461 align:middle line:84%
And essentially all
that really means

00:27:46.461 --> 00:27:49.850 align:middle line:84%
is that the faster you
move through space,

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
the slower you move through
time and vice versa.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.290 align:middle line:84%
If I stay still, I'm moving
through time at full speed.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing that moves the
fastest through space is light.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, light
moves through space

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:84%
at the speed of
light, which means

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.470 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't experience any time.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So a photon that's emitted at
the beginning of the universe

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:84%
from a very distant star
that hits my eyeball

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.864 align:middle line:84%
hasn't experienced
any time at all.

00:28:13.864 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:84%
It's under then
quantum mechanics,

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.190 align:middle line:90%
the other bit of the story.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The act of observing
this piece of starlight

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.800 align:middle line:84%
collapses the wave function
back then in that star.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So Wheeler's famous quote is
we're not only participators

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:84%
in the here and now, but also
in the far away and long ago.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So he's really he's
really painting

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:39.070 align:middle line:84%
a picture of a universe that's
far more squishy time-wise

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and is much more temporally
caused than we liked to think.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we also
then take the idea

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that electromagnetic
fields themselves

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.430 align:middle line:84%
are the very stuff
of consciousness,

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.210 align:middle line:84%
then we really begin to
see maybe what's going on,

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:84%
which may be something
more far stranger,

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:84%
more conscious, and more
retro temporally caused

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:84%
than most of the
current theories

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:90%
would currently propose.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It seems, John,
that physicists are basically

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:10%
saying that there's some
kind of pattern and order

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.440 align:middle line:10%
in the universe that is unique.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.147 align:middle line:84%
And somehow they're bringing
human beings into the picture?

00:29:21.147 --> 00:29:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Mm-hmm.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do we
have to do with it?

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:90%
What did we do?

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Well,
Wheeler's saying observers--

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.190 align:middle line:84%
do you remember "The
Hitchhiker's Guide

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.500 align:middle line:90%
to the Galaxy" and the--

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: --that
thing they had

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:84%
called the infinite
improbability drive.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was infinitely
improbable,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.310 align:middle line:84%
but it's still that you
got the best outcome.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So it collapses to
the best outcome.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The best universe is just
what's going to happen,

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:90%
according to Wheeler.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Because the best universe is
going to have observers in it.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which could be us.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:51.811 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Which is us.

00:29:51.811 --> 00:29:53.647 align:middle line:84%
This is the best
possible universe.

00:29:53.647 --> 00:29:55.480 align:middle line:84%
They can't find another
one that's as stable

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and does as many
interesting things,

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:90%
however you turn these dials.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not that there are
millions of other dead, lifeless

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.187 align:middle line:84%
universes with dials
spun to the wrong things.

00:30:04.187 --> 00:30:05.770 align:middle line:84%
You're just going
to get the best one.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.997 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
Wheeler's work lies.

00:30:07.997 --> 00:30:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that I think
is interesting about this way

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
of looking at it is that you
can extend Wheeler's theory

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, if observers
can collapse the whole universe

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.060 align:middle line:84%
into the best
universe, then what

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.820 align:middle line:84%
happens around a planet of
conscious observers like us?

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to
this theory, which

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.652 align:middle line:84%
I'm calling the local
anthropic principle,

00:30:26.652 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:90%
we're just localizing--

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this your theory?

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: This
is my theory, yes,

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.640 align:middle line:90%
the local anthropic principle.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:84%
If Wheeler's right and observers
can do this to the universe,

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.680 align:middle line:84%
then let's extend his
theory just to the local

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, around planets
of conscious observers,

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:43.600 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see all sorts
of really odd, beautiful things.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do we
find around Earth?

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Lots of very odd, beautiful
things that shouldn't be there.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And we can make a prediction
from this theory as well.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.865 align:middle line:84%
We can say, well,
we would also expect

00:30:54.865 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:84%
to find lots of very
odd and beautiful things

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:84%
around other planets
of conscious observers.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.705 align:middle line:84%
And so that was when
I thought, well, OK,

00:31:01.705 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:90%
that's a prediction theory.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.826 align:middle line:84%
Can I test this
theory in any way?

00:31:04.826 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we haven't
found any other planets

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:90%
of conscious observers yet.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But a couple of
years ago, they did

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.391 align:middle line:84%
discover a very
interesting planetary

00:31:11.391 --> 00:31:13.360 align:middle line:90%
system called TRAPPIST.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And Google changed its logo
to the TRAPPIST system.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about TRAPPIST is that--

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.550 align:middle line:84%
or what was immediately
interesting about TRAPPIST

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.230 align:middle line:84%
is that it has four planets
in a habitable zone.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.530 align:middle line:84%
They're all big planets,
Earth-sized planets.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:84%
There orbiting very close to
this little white dwarf star.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And they all appear about
as big as the moon does,

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.650 align:middle line:90%
these planets, in the sky.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And NASA then named this as
the number one habitable zone

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.360 align:middle line:90%
destination.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the
Goldilocks, right?

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.915 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: In the
whole thing, yeah.

00:31:45.915 --> 00:31:48.040 align:middle line:84%
If NASA had to build a
rocket right now and send it

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:84%
anywhere expecting
to find life--

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They'd go there.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: --they'd go to
TRAPPIST, the TRAPPIST system.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So according to my theory, you'd
expect to find lots of fives

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and golden sections and
lovely Fibonacci numbers.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And what do we find when
we look at TRAPPIST?

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.400 align:middle line:90%
We find lots of Fibs.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.306 align:middle line:90%
In fact, the entire--

00:32:06.306 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just like
you predicted.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: --the
entire solar system's

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:09.974 align:middle line:90%
built on Fibonacci numbers.

00:32:09.974 --> 00:32:12.154 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does that tell
you there is life there?

00:32:12.154 --> 00:32:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Or a high probability?

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Under
my theory, we've

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:84%
got NASA saying that's
where they'd go for life.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.804 align:middle line:84%
And unlike any other
system I've ever looked at,

00:32:18.804 --> 00:32:20.470 align:middle line:84%
you've also got these
Fibonacci numbers,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.980 align:middle line:84%
which would tend to indicate
that Wheeler's theory is right.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.630 align:middle line:84%
If there is life
there, it's also

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.220 align:middle line:84%
kind of got this
fingerprint of life

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:26.670 align:middle line:90%
that our solar system's got.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:28.211 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
saying life could

00:32:28.211 --> 00:32:30.580 align:middle line:84%
be predicted in the
universe based on geometry?

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah, based
on incredibly unlikely

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.746 align:middle line:84%
beautiful things going on around
them if this theory is right.

00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.869 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: So there's a
kind of fingerprint of life.

00:32:39.869 --> 00:32:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And life is able to warp
reality, if you like,

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you test
your theory though, John?

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: We won't.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Until we find another planet
of conscious observers,

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.710 align:middle line:90%
we won't know.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: We won't know.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
frustrating for you?

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, it may not be, hopefully--

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.160 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it is slightly
frustrating obviously.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:90%
But you never know.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.484 align:middle line:84%
It could also be used to
choose which planets we went to

00:33:03.484 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:90%
at some point in the future.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had a group
of physicists, scientists,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.039 align:middle line:90%
philosophers together--

00:33:08.039 --> 00:33:08.838 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah.

00:33:08.838 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they all come
up with similar theories?

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: No, I
don't think they would.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty far
out, this theory.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.910 align:middle line:84%
It's much further out than
any mainstream scientist would

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:90%
probably put their name to.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:23.400 align:middle line:84%
They may privately wonder
whether, in fact, there

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.540 align:middle line:90%
isn't some truth in it.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But it would be quite hard to
find the people in paid tenure

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:32.100 align:middle line:84%
who'd go out there and start
talking about Venus pentagrams.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.320 align:middle line:90%
It just all gets a little--

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.380 align:middle line:84%
yes, it's just not quite
their kind of thing.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Biocentrism
seems to come up a lot.

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at what this is.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yes.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to
have you explain that.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.594 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Absolutely.

00:33:44.594 --> 00:33:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Reality involves
your consciousness.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.090 align:middle line:90%
We're not measuring the world.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:54.890 align:middle line:90%
We're creating it.

00:33:54.890 --> 00:34:00.890 align:middle line:90%


00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So every now and then, a
very simple but radical idea

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:09.620 align:middle line:84%
shakes the foundations
of knowledge.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.520 align:middle line:10%
Biocentrism is turning the
world upside down again

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.940 align:middle line:10%
with the seemingly simple
idea that the universe arises

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.739 align:middle line:10%
from life, not the
other way around.

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:23.320 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.530 align:middle line:10%
We think that life is just
an accident of physics.

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:29.309 align:middle line:84%
But a long list of experiments
suggests exactly the opposite.

00:34:29.309 --> 00:34:36.980 align:middle line:90%


00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.489 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, if you add life and
consciousness to the equation,

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:44.360 align:middle line:84%
you can explain some of the
biggest puzzles in science.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.710 align:middle line:10%
So the view of the world in
which life and consciousness

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:51.380 align:middle line:10%
are bottom line to understanding
the larger universe

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.540 align:middle line:10%
is called biocentrism.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.370 align:middle line:10%
Bottom line is, and the first
principle of biocentrism

00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:01.640 align:middle line:10%
is, is that reality
involves your consciousness.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.380 align:middle line:90%
We're not measuring the world.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.260 align:middle line:90%
We're creating it.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.540 align:middle line:84%
We go through life,
we grow completely

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
oblivious to what's going
on around us in the world.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.150 align:middle line:84%
But experiment after
experiment shows

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.250 align:middle line:84%
that not a single
particle out of the Earth

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.730 align:middle line:84%
exists with real properties
until it's observed.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't take
a genius to realize

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.560 align:middle line:84%
that reality is
a process, again,

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.697 align:middle line:90%
that involves consciousness.

00:35:26.697 --> 00:35:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something very
weird going on here, John,

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:29.000 align:middle line:90%
isn't there?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, great.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.269 align:middle line:84%
Robert Lanza's book was
real eye-opener for me.

00:35:33.269 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was dynamite.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.935 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah,
I really enjoyed it.

00:35:35.935 --> 00:35:38.090 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a
great, great ride into--

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good theory?

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yes.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing is
it's extreme solipsism,

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:47.750 align:middle line:84%
it's called in philosophy,
where everything's just

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:48.830 align:middle line:90%
occurring around you.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.096 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
there's a lot of truth in it.

00:35:51.096 --> 00:35:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are
some interesting points

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:84%
he makes in that
book, one of which

00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:00.600 align:middle line:84%
is that you never see
these colors, shapes

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.740 align:middle line:90%
and things, sounds.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't exist.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.680 align:middle line:84%
There is no sound
in the universe.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:90%
There are pressure waves.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.250 align:middle line:84%
But the sound
occurs in my brain.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.950 align:middle line:84%
It's my brain that makes
things happen, my mind.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So these colors that
I am looking at,

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:18.470 align:middle line:90%
they're not out there.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.690 align:middle line:90%
The universe isn't colored.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.985 align:middle line:84%
Color is a product
of my experience.

00:36:22.985 --> 00:36:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
this tell you, John?

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.080 align:middle line:84%
What does this tell you
about the universe itself?

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Give me your best guess on
what you think this all means.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: OK.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're
looking at-- if you

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:42.410 align:middle line:84%
put Wheeler together and
minds, putting mind first,

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and maybe mix in the electric
universe people, who I think

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.070 align:middle line:84%
are very interesting,
I think you're looking

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.670 align:middle line:90%
at the universe as a huge mind.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:54.725 align:middle line:90%
It has to be a huge mind.

00:36:54.725 --> 00:36:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think it's alive?

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.516 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: It's
got to be alive.

00:36:57.516 --> 00:37:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And we are very, very
important parts of it.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.450 align:middle line:90%
We are its eyes, if you like.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.167 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Has it created itself?

00:37:05.167 --> 00:37:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah,
I think it probably

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:09.930 align:middle line:90%
has and always has been.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And the use of the past tense
there, in Wheeler terms,

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.600 align:middle line:90%
already gets you into trouble.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:21.224 align:middle line:84%
But you're looking at a huge,
wet, electrical thing that

00:37:21.224 --> 00:37:23.640 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really experience past,
present, or future, that's

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.270 align:middle line:84%
always just optimizing the
best conditions for A, itself

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and particularly for
its eyes, like us,

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.367 align:middle line:84%
its sensory organs, which
is things like this planet.

00:37:33.367 --> 00:37:35.700 align:middle line:84%
That's why we've got all these
extraordinarily beautiful

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.680 align:middle line:90%
things going on around us.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.874 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the
universe create God?

00:37:41.874 --> 00:37:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: It's really a--

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Talk about
a profound question.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I think when we're
thinking along these lines

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and examining these
questions in these ways,

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:57.600 align:middle line:84%
we're learning more about
what God, or a god, might be.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.320 align:middle line:84%
But I prefer just to think of
the whole thing as the mind

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.960 align:middle line:90%
of the universe really.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:90%
We're really getting some--

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.070 align:middle line:84%
hopefully getting some insights
into the mind of the universe.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is Elon
Musk right, John?

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.844 align:middle line:90%
Are we in a digital universe?

00:38:11.844 --> 00:38:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: In a
simulation-- he's not alone.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I think Paul Davies, the
physicist Paul Davies,

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.890 align:middle line:84%
is another secret believer
in that same theory.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a weird feeling.

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:23.939 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah.

00:38:23.939 --> 00:38:24.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's--

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I hope they don't
shut off their computer on us

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.170 align:middle line:90%
one day.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: No.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously,
if you're Elon Musk,

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.773 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing must
feel like a simulation,

00:38:30.773 --> 00:38:33.560 align:middle line:84%
because you get to be building
rockets and everything just

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.780 align:middle line:84%
like you would be if you were
playing a great computer game.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he may be right.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we just
simply don't know.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, you
think, what is a simulation?

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.316 align:middle line:90%
Is a dream a simulation?

00:38:44.316 --> 00:38:46.065 align:middle line:84%
When I have a dream,
is that a simulation?

00:38:46.065 --> 00:38:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly, good point.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:48.894 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: It's
kind of very possible

00:38:48.894 --> 00:38:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that we are simulations in
the mind of the universe.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a similar way
of looking at-- all

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:58.290 align:middle line:84%
of these different solutions
actually overlap very nicely.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had that one
question you wanted answered,

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:03.420 align:middle line:90%
what would the question be?

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.590 align:middle line:90%
You have one question.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.420 align:middle line:90%
You're allowed just one.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:90%
You'll get the answer.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:90%
What's the question?

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: How far
to the nearest planet

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:90%
with conscious observers on it?

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:15.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'd like to know.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With life?

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah,
I'd love to know that.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want to know that?

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.899 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah,
that would be my thing.

00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some believe
we've been visited already.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think that's
probably quite likely too.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would want to
ask, how did it start?

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if they
could give me the answer?

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure they could,
because they probably

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:90%
don't know it either.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:40.316 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: No,
no, that's right.

00:39:40.316 --> 00:39:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people get
more information on your books

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.664 align:middle line:90%
and what you do, John?

00:39:44.664 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Well, my publishing
company is called Wooden Books.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:48.246 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wooden Books?

00:39:48.246 --> 00:39:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Wooden Books, yeah.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Our most recent book
was called "Megalith."

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.946 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.946 --> 00:39:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can go to
woodenbooks.com.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And this subject I'm talking
with you about today,

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm still writing
the book actually.

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm halfway through
chapter 2 of five chapters.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it changing?

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:05.845 align:middle line:90%
Do you find it evolving?

00:40:05.845 --> 00:40:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: It's been really
helpful coming on this show

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.200 align:middle line:90%
and talking it through with you.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.190 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it is.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.990 align:middle line:90%
It is evolving.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.230 align:middle line:84%
It stopped evolving
in really big ways.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So I think with the discovery
of the TRAPPIST system,

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.010 align:middle line:90%
that really--

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and when I plotted the
TRAPPIST system's planets

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and I saw a double Venus
spiral thing in there,

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I was just like, right, this
is really, really interesting.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
NASA think that's

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.170 align:middle line:84%
where they'd send a
rocket, and all my research

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:40.240 align:middle line:84%
would agree with it, just
purely on the geometry

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.304 align:middle line:90%
and the harmony--

00:40:41.304 --> 00:40:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So not
only do we believe

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.870 align:middle line:84%
the planet may be alive
with the "gaia" theory,

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:47.925 align:middle line:90%
but that the universe is alive?

00:40:47.925 --> 00:40:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And growing.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARTINEAU: Yeah, and growing.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the multiverse theory?

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.676 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: Well,
the multiverse theory

00:40:55.676 --> 00:40:57.030 align:middle line:90%
may or may not be true.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it arose initially out
of the theory of inflation.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's to do with
what happened in the Big

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.476 align:middle line:90%
Bang and all the rest of it.

00:41:03.476 --> 00:41:06.195 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.195 --> 00:41:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What do you think?

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.592 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: With the
multiverse, I'm just--

00:41:09.592 --> 00:41:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're holding back.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.090 align:middle line:90%
I can tell.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:12.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: I am
suspicious of it.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
think it's real.

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:15.165 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: I think it
defies Occam's razor.

00:41:15.165 --> 00:41:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
nearly bad science.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.840 align:middle line:10%
It's not actually bad science.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:23.520 align:middle line:10%
And I think when you
start ignoring clues

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.960 align:middle line:10%
to what's really going on--
and those clues, I think,

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.760 align:middle line:10%
are present around this
planet of conscious observers.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would choose
Wheeler's approach,

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:37.379 align:middle line:84%
plus the local version of
it, over the multiverse.

00:41:37.379 --> 00:41:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm not say there
isn't a multiverse.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:90%
But I would predict--

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
don't think there is.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: I'd predict
if there is a multiverse,

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.229 align:middle line:84%
I think they've all
got life in them.

00:41:43.229 --> 00:41:44.520 align:middle line:90%
They're all beautiful, perfect.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god, absolutely.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: They're
all perfected.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.748 align:middle line:90%
They've all got life in them.

00:41:47.748 --> 00:41:49.930 align:middle line:84%
I think the rule is
that this thing happens,

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and it happens
beautifully every time.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you convinced
that we are not alone?

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: How
can we be alone?

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, unless it's all
a simulation or whatever.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:41:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: We can't
possibly be alone.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:02.350 align:middle line:84%
John, thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.516 align:middle line:84%
>>MARTINEAU: George, thanks
very much for having me.

00:42:04.516 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are we alone
in the universe?

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.840 align:middle line:10%
John thinks we're not.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.100 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:14.760 align:middle line:90%
