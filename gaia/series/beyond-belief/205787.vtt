tangible evidence being

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.820 align:middle line:84%
withheld from the general public
that we might not be alone,

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.130 align:middle line:84%
how significant of a
story would you give that?

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to create a
feature-length documentary

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.358 align:middle line:84%
film that would transcend
the UFO community.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:90%
How do you walk away from that?

>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:10%
I've been wanting
to get this guy back

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:10%
on the program for years,
and we finally did.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:84%
James Fox, the
director and producer

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.110 align:middle line:84%
of critically acclaimed
UFO documentaries.

"Out of the Blue."

"I Know What I Saw," and
most recently the blockbuster

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.570 align:middle line:90%
"The Phenomenon."

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.692 align:middle line:90%
What a great film.

00:00:53.692 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, thank you.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many years did it
take you to develop that, Jim?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:10%
>>FOX: From concept
to completion--

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:10%
I started when I was 43 and
I finished when I was 52.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:10%
And when we were in the
edit room a number of times,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:10%
people would go, who's
that guy in South Amer--

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:10%
oh, is that you?

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.408 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] I was like, yeah, I
definitely age in the process.

00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Years of change.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes, definitely.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:90%
It was wearing, that's for sure.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
it's a great film.

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Oh, thank you.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.185 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And tell me
about the concept.

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:90%
How did you develop it?

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: I have done three
other films, as you just

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:90%
announced to your audience.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
a certain vision

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:84%
in your head of how you
see things materializing,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and then when you
finish the film,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:90%
you're never quite satisfied.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I did another
film on the topic,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and that vision wasn't
quite fully satisfied,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:84%
even though I remember pushing
my editor and my co-producers

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
so hard that one of them
was-- this was in 2003--

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
one of them-- this was when I
was making "Out of the Blue--"

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
was in a fetal position
on the ground, crying.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And his wife turned
to me and she's

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.830 align:middle line:90%
like, you're killing my husband!

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Stop pushing him!

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Stop it!

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Just stop it!

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.543 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are a driver.

00:02:08.543 --> 00:02:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And so I
realized, OK, I wanted

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
to create a
feature-length documentary

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
film on the topic of UFOs
that would transcend the UFO

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
community and penetrate a much
broader, global, mainstream

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:90%
audience.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you've done that.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And so that's why
I kept pushing to do it.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And people say to me, you know,
I've seen some of the critics

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:90%
online.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And I did a really
good job digging

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
up archival, never-before-seen
archived material.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But the history is
the history, and I

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:84%
had to spend the first
45 minutes of the film

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:84%
presenting my case to make
the second half of the film

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:84%
tangible, digestible,
and believable,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:84%
because I was dealing
with, for the first time,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
close encounters
of the third kind,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
whereas the witnesses are
reporting beings associated

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.248 align:middle line:90%
with the craft.

00:02:59.248 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
What got you
interested in ufology?

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Funny enough, I had a
really good friend of mine,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:84%
this guy Rene Harris
in high school,

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:90%
we graduated from high school.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:90%
We were 18.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:90%
We flew to Europe.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.390 align:middle line:90%
We drove across.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
We bought an old
beat-up Fiat 131,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and we drove it across London
and down into Portugal.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:90%
And we were really good friends.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.718 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me
about UFOs and I just

00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:22.260 align:middle line:84%
thought, oh, man,
this guy, you know?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
What was he-- and then he kept
kind of going on about it.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And then within a couple
of years, I kind of just

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:90%
wrote him off.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, I can't
associate myself with this guy

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:90%
He's clearly lost his mind.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.332 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
UFOs having crashed

00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking about this
huge government cover-up.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned it
in passing to a guy

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that I looked up to in the field
of videography and documentary

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.220 align:middle line:90%
filmmaking.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, yeah, you don't
know about the Roswell crash?

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:90%
You don't know about this?

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, no, Richard.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, oh, yeah,
that absolutely happened.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:90%
And that got me--

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That got you hooked.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: It got me hooked.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And I started-- I went to
a couple of conferences.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I met a few military
guys and I thought, hmm.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:84%
There appears to be something
more than swamp gas and weather

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:90%
balloons to this phenomenon.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.133 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sink my teeth into
it a little bit, and I did.

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it Roswell
that hooked you?

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: It was Stanton Friedman.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God rest his soul.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yep.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:90%
It was Stanton Friedman.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It was Edgar
Mitchell, Apollo 14.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Hynek after his time
with the United States Air

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Force--

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:90%
When he came a believer.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: When he became not just
a believer, but he was-- yeah,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.797 align:middle line:90%
he founded the CUFOS.

00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Center for UFO Studies.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Started CUFOS.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.783 align:middle line:90%
He started doing all that.

00:04:30.783 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, here's a guy that
worked in an official capacity

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:84%
for the United States
Air Force from '47

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
to '69 whose job it was to
provide prosaic explanations

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:84%
for the phenomenon when
clearly a lot of times

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:90%
there wasn't one.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And deny, deny, deny.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Deny, deny, deny.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And then he does
his flip, you know?

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, there's
something going on here.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:90%
And look.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:84%
People say, why is it
that I do what I do?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And I answer that
question with a question

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, if there was
tangible evidence being

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
withheld from the general public
that we might not be alone,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:84%
how significant of a
story would you give that?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:90%
And people go, oh, well, jeez.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle line:84%
If that were true, that would be
the most significant discovery

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.355 align:middle line:90%
of our time.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a 10 out of 10.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, I'm
convinced it's happening.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So how do you walk
away from that?

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we both know
Dr. J. Allen Hynek's son

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Paul who would tell us that it
was the Lonnie Zamora police

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
officer in Socorro, New Mexico,
case that convinced J. Allen

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Hynek, his father,
that these were real,

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:90%
that something was going on.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:84%
In that case, Zamora was
driving his police cruiser

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:84%
along the highway, and
he looks to the right

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and sees what he thinks is
a white car flipped over.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:90%
And he went, oh my god.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.900 align:middle line:90%
So he stops, of course.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.370 align:middle line:90%
He's a police officer.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
As he gets closer, he
notices it's not a white car,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
but it's some kind of craft with
a couple occupants scurrying

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.050 align:middle line:84%
around on the outside who see
him, jump in it, and take off.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's coming
from a police officer.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:90%
You've got to believe the guy.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: What people don't know
about that case is that just

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:90%
a week prior--

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:90%
this was April 24, 1964.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:84%
A week prior, probably
five days prior,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Vallee,
Dr. Jacques Vallee

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
was at Wright-Patterson
Air Force

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Base in Dayton,
Ohio, with Dr. Hynek.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying,
Dr. Hynek, you've

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:84%
got to take a look
at the blue book

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.050 align:middle line:90%
file cases that are marked--

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.390 align:middle line:84%
they're written off
as psychological,

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
because those are the
close encounter cases.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And we've got those
happening in France.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:84%
There was a wave in the '50s of
landings and reports of beings.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to tell Hynek,
you guys are writing them off

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
in your files as psychological,
but I'm telling you,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.185 align:middle line:90%
these are close encounters.

00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nut job cases.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.552 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Yeah, you've got
to look into these cases.

00:06:57.552 --> 00:06:58.630 align:middle line:90%
There's something to it.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.922 align:middle line:84%
And he was at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base with him.

00:07:00.922 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Two days later,
he gets the call.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a landing in
Socorro, New Mexico,

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:84%
with a police officer,
Lonnie Zamora.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And there were military guys
on the scene within an hour.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
They were physical trace
cases on the ground.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.618 align:middle line:84%
There were footprints
from the creatures.

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:18.010 align:middle line:84%
There were smoldering
bushes from the propulsion.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:90%
They were massive imprints.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:84%
They determined the weight, the
diameter of the landing gear.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:84%
That is the most
well-documented close encounter

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:90%
of the third kind in US history.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something's going
on, as you well know.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: That changed.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed for this
film, "The Phenomenon,"

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.290 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed--

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I got to know-- it's a
very tight-knit community

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:90%
in Socorro, New Mexico.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:84%
You can't just come in as an
outsider and expect open doors.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:90%
I had to slowly--

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.733 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You need somebody
to feel confident.

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Paul Harden kind
of got me in the door,

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and I slowly got
to know the family.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I got to know the
wife, Mary Zamora.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.048 align:middle line:84%
I eventually got her comfortable
enough to go on camera.

00:07:51.048 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And Lonnie's gone now.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Lonnie was gone, but
I got a lot of wonderful--

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I got to go into his archives
for the first time in history.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever gone into
his black duffel bag.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
His wife trusted
me with that task.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.220 align:middle line:90%
I got flatbed scanners.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:90%
I scanned letters.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.740 align:middle line:90%
I scanned documents.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
All the correspondence
between him and the Air Force.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
His wife told me that he must
have seen something that truly

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and profoundly changed
him, because he was never

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:90%
the same after that encounter.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.880 align:middle line:84%
He had direct eye contact
with one of the beings,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
because as you said earlier,
he was expecting to see--

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A flipped over car.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Yeah, when you're looking
at something you've never seen

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:84%
before, it's very
difficult to kind of--

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:84%
you want to provide some kind of
explanation that's a rational--

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he sees
it from a distance.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: He does.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's driving up.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: But he gets eye contact
with one of the beings,

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:90%
because he was calling out.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.852 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of
like, you guys OK?

00:08:45.852 --> 00:08:48.060 align:middle line:84%
These are kind of details
that I've learned about it.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.667 align:middle line:84%
And one of them turned and
looked him right in the eye,

00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:90%
so he had a direct--

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, wow.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yeah.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.235 align:middle line:84%
And his wife was convinced-- and
he went straight to the priest

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:57.827 align:middle line:84%
after this incident
happened, and--

00:08:57.827 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was shaken up.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.910 align:middle line:10%
>>FOX: He was very shaken
up, and he was never--

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:10%
he was never the same.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And the aspect of the close
encounter of the third kind,

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.193 align:middle line:84%
the beings associated
with the craft,

00:09:07.193 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:84%
was something that the
United States Air Force

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.193 align:middle line:90%
wanted to really downplay.

00:09:10.193 --> 00:09:12.652 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we've been talking
about your incredible film,

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:90%
"The Phenomenon."

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's give our viewers a
little taste of what that is.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Great.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.820 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:10%
>> There are cases that are
not explainable in conventional

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.120 align:middle line:10%
terms.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>> That have been made
by credible observers

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.198 align:middle line:90%
of relatively incredible things.

00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>> We got right up to it.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.100 align:middle line:10%
It lit up.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Was this a warning?

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Was this an attempt
to communicate?

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I felt scared.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I was running and playing,
and then I saw this maroon

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:90%
color in the sky.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It was not anything
from this Earth.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It was looking at all of us.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:58.150 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe they're
trying to communicate.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.180 align:middle line:10%
>> They were reaching out to us.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an immense array
of unanswered questions

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and an urgent need to
get to the bottom of it.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The public has
a right to know.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.982 align:middle line:90%
>> My gosh.

00:10:12.982 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Look at this thing.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The question is no longer
if they are here, but why.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> What are they doing?

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:90%
What do they want from us?

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.200 align:middle line:90%
What are their motivations?

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>> For over 75 years, there
have been sightings in the sky.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>> A UFO shut down several
missile silos in Montana.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> This is unreal.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Thousands of
witnesses worldwide.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> There had to be
a data collection.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure they
scanned the warheads.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Just kind of hovering there.

00:10:39.742 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
It never changed its
longitudinal axis.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes, poof, and
it takes off out the side.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And high-level cover-ups.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The government was covering
up what happened at Roswell.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Hiding these dark secrets.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:84%

anything there when I knew

there was.

>> People need to know there
is something else out there.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, there have been
visitation, crashed craft,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:10%
material recovered.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Shouldn't we be spending
some money to study all of these

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.515 align:middle line:10%
phenomena?

00:11:11.515 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:10%

for the front page of "The New

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:10%
York Times."

>> They were trying
to communicate,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:90%
trying to tell us something.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Now it's time to
tell people about it.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:10%
>> These things are real.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:10%
They're here.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:90%
This is happening now.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What a
gangbuster film, Jim.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:90%
And these are real people too.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.378 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes it
even more exciting.

00:11:41.378 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: You create
something, and then

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.487 align:middle line:84%
you push it out of its nest,
and you hope it flies, right?

00:11:45.487 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:90%
And you hope it's well received.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you don't know
what's going to happen.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: You don't know
what's going to happen,

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.187 align:middle line:84%
and you put your heart
and soul into it.

00:11:51.187 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were some very
dark moments of production

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:90%
during that eight-year period.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to lie.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful highlights as well.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.732 align:middle line:84%
But you really hope at
the end of the day--

00:12:01.732 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
because you're sitting
at the poker table

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're pushing all in on one
bet, and it's a little scary.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is scary.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.833 align:middle line:90%
But that one bet paid off.

00:12:10.833 --> 00:12:11.750 align:middle line:90%
People love this film.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: It's doing
really well, yeah.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have people arguing
over who's going to buy it.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I noticed you had
a little bit of Edgar Mitchell.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: You know, I did
that intentionally.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:90%
I did that intentionally.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.883 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I miss him.

00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Tremendous
respect for him.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:90%
And I had to address Roswell.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.813 align:middle line:84%
And I was working
with Jacques Vellee,

00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:84%
who's the intellectual
heavyweight

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.480 align:middle line:90%
in the world on the topic of--

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's the French
guy in the movie--

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: "Close
Encounters," exactly.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And Jacques-- and
I know the baggage

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:84%
that comes along with
Roswell, and people say

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.472 align:middle line:90%
Roswell's been beaten to death.

00:12:39.472 --> 00:12:40.430 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I covered in the context of
I was doing the Rockefeller

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.250 align:middle line:84%
initiative, and I was covering
that aspect of the production.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And Rockefeller was asked by
the Clinton administration

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:84%
to choose a case they'd go
after, and he chose Roswell.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, I have to do
a snapshot history of Roswell,

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:90%
and I did.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:90%
I went after archival footage.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that stuff of Jesse
Marcel, that stuff's like--

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that's the hardest
footage to ever

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:90%
possibly get your hands on.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you what we went
through to find that footage.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we treated it and
made it look really great.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But in any case,
Dr. Edgar Mitchell

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:90%
grew up just outside Roswell.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.637 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:13:18.637 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And he used
to tell me as a kid--

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:90%
he remembers growing up there.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:84%
When he came back in the '70s
after he'd landed on the moon,

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:90%
he knew all those ranchers.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:84%
They knew him, and
now he's famous.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And so they told him,
hey, you know what?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:84%
What crashed out here was
not a weather balloon at all.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.002 align:middle line:90%
It was not of this Earth.

00:13:34.002 --> 00:13:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He told me once in--

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.570 align:middle line:84%
let's see what he
may have told you--

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:42.980 align:middle line:84%
that he never saw a UFO,
but he was told by people

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:90%
in government, they exist.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you got too?

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.377 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: That's
exactly right, yeah.

00:13:47.377 --> 00:13:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because there are things
circulating that Gordon Cooper

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:90%
had UFO sightings in space.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Gordon Cooper did have a UFO
sighting while piloting--

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Took great pictures and
they took them from him, right?

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well--

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I'm told.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.523 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Yeah, not-- that was
McDivitt, James McDivitt.

00:14:04.523 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They took the film.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes, they did.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.660 align:middle line:84%
That is a legitimate
UFO encounter

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.437 align:middle line:84%
that was captured on
film, James McDivitt.

00:14:10.437 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But I was talking
about Gordon Cooper,

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and there's also been
other things circulating

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:90%
about Edgar Mitchell.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Mitchell was a proponent
for government transparency,

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:84%
a firm believer that
we're being visited,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
firm believer that Roswell
happened the way they initially

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:90%
announced it happening.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:84%
An alien spaceship
crashed, bodies recovered.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's got
intelligence access.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:84%
But he himself had
never had a sighting.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:90%
I believed him.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're losing some great
ufologists and investigators.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Mitchell, gone.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Stanton Friedman, gone.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:90%
Clifford Stone, gone.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
but Hopkins, gone.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:90%
John Mack, gone.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Do we have people coming
up through the ranks

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:90%
to keep this thing going?

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.833 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: [SIGH] Well, I'm
doing the best I can to get--

00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're one of them.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, no.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing the best I can to
get the level of interest up.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm targeting a
younger generation.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing--

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I don't consider
you a UFO researcher.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.690 align:middle line:90%
You're a producer.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.390 align:middle line:84%
You're an expert when it comes
to putting together visuals.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.247 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: But I get in the field
and I travel to location.

00:15:16.247 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:90%
I go to the landing sites.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:84%
I go to Africa and
Australia and South Africa

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and China and Russia
and all across Europe

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and meet with the witnesses.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.633 align:middle line:90%
I go to the landing sites.

00:15:26.633 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I do all that.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:90%
I go to the National Archives.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.333 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a researcher,
director, filmmaker for sure.

00:15:32.333 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: First and foremost.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.958 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: But I don't
consider myself

00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:84%
one of the preeminent--
but the cases

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.705 align:middle line:84%
that I do know, I know
not from reading a book.

00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:39.830 align:middle line:90%
I know from actually going.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Like, with the Socorro case,
I know that case pretty well.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the
National Archives.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:90%
I read the books.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you
said some things

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.052 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know about.

00:15:47.052 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Yeah, and I
met with the family

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and I met with his
coworkers, and there

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:84%
are aspects of that encounter
that didn't end up in the film.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:55.370 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, yeah.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:84%
So I am a researcher,
but I'm more a filmmaker.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And my goal is to put the most
credible evidence together

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
in a package that could be
presented to mainstream, that

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.637 align:middle line:84%
could be presented to the
scientific community, that

00:16:08.637 --> 00:16:12.020 align:middle line:84%
could be accepted to
say, hey, look, guys.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:90%
There's something going on.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:84%
There doesn't appear to be
a terrestrial explanation.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's look into this further,
and let's encourage government

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:90%
transparency.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.928 align:middle line:84%
We have a call to action
at the end of the film.

00:16:22.928 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
hope they do it.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:25.435 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: [LAUGHS]

00:16:25.435 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's going on
with government right now?

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we see these
UFO stories with pilots.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
We hear all about
these incredible cases.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
We hear that the government
is spending millions

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:90%
of dollars in research.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: So because of the
success of this film and some

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
of the people that
I had exposure to--

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Mellon,
Elizondo, "New York Times,"

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.610 align:middle line:90%
obviously Jacques Vellee--

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm told that-- oh,
Senator Harry Reid--

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.962 align:middle line:84%
I'm told that the
evidence that was released

00:16:58.962 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
on the front page of
"The New York Times"

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:90%
is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.122 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, talking
about former Senator Reid,

00:17:04.122 --> 00:17:05.958 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look at
what he had to say.

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll come back
and get your reaction.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Excellent.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Senator Harry Reid who
instigated the secret Pentagon

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:10%
UFO program confirmed what
nuclear launch officers have

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.145 align:middle line:10%
been reporting for decades.

00:17:19.145 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRY REID: There's
more than one up there.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>> UFOs have interfered with
our country's most powerful

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:90%
weapons.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:10%
>>REID: If they had been
called upon by the president

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:10%
to launch, they
couldn't have done it.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Did you have
anybody in the Defense

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Department, the Pentagon
pull you aside, bend your ear

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and say, [TONGUE CLICK]
why are you doing this?

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REID: I did everything
I could to stop

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.820 align:middle line:10%
the program from going forward.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:10%
They gave the person
that came to me initially

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:10%
such a bad time.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:84%
He's fortunate to have
hung onto his job,

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:84%
because people tried to get
rid of him, because they

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:90%
wanted nothing to do with this.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:84%
The Defense Intelligence
Agency was one of the worst.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
They drug their
feet, even though one

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:84%
of their senior
scientists thought

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:90%
they should look at this.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And remember, all
were saying nobody

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.820 align:middle line:90%
has to agree why it's there.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But shouldn't we at least
be spending some money

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.760 align:middle line:84%
to study all of
these phenomenon?

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Shouldn't we study this stuff?

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
The answer is yes, and
that's all this was about.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And why the federal government
all these years has covered up,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:84%
put brake pads on
everything, stopped it,

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.355 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very, very
bad for our country.

00:18:37.355 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: I interviewed Gordon
Cooper, mercury astronaut

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Gordon Cooper back in the '90s.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Cooper said on camera that
there was a landed UFO circa

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:90%
1957 at Edwards Air Force Base.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
His camera crew captured
the filming of this object.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And he presented this
to the higher ups,

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.258 align:middle line:84%
and eventually a courier
jet came in from Washington.

00:19:04.258 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
He handed the footage
over, which was good.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:06.750 align:middle line:90%
He viewed it.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REID: That's the
last he saw of it.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.655 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Exactly.

00:19:08.655 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Did you know where that footage
went of the flying saucer

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.105 align:middle line:90%
that landed on the--

00:19:12.105 --> 00:19:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GORDON COOPER: It
went to Washington.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:90%
That's all I know.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.820 align:middle line:10%
>>FOX: Did you ever keep in
touch with anybody about it

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:10%
or discuss it?

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COOPER: How would I keep in
touch with anybody about it?

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no way
within the military

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:84%
or within the government of
keeping track of something that

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.902 align:middle line:90%
is classified.

00:19:25.902 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Did you try to go
after stuff like this?

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REID: It's there.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Are you
saying that there's

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:84%
some evidence that still
hasn't seen the light of day?

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REID: I'm saying most of it
hasn't seen the light of day.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's priceless.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Priceless.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Isn't that amazing?

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That Cooper stuff--

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: I get the chills.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:90%
I get the chills to this day.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:90%
To this day.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell you
how that happened,

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.800 align:middle line:84%
because getting the interview
with Senator Harry Reid

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:90%
was a miracle.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.620 align:middle line:84%
It took several months
of negotiations.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And there was a very narrow
window for us to strike.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.708 align:middle line:84%
And George Knapp was
incredibly instrumental,

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:84%
working tirelessly behind
the scenes to make it happen.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's one of the
best reporters out there.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.462 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Love George Knapp.

00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Tremendous respect for him.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.520 align:middle line:90%
And we got the interview.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And five minutes before
it was supposed to start,

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:24.995 align:middle line:84%
I get a phone call, and
everything's falling apart,

00:20:24.995 --> 00:20:25.795 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:20:25.795 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:84%
This interview's about
to get terminated.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Apparently someone on your
set is really irritated.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I suggest you do
damage control, stat.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking around
the room, going, who

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.930 align:middle line:90%
on Earth would screw this up?

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the biggest
moment of my life!

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it almost fell
apart at the last minute.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Oh, I'm not
kidding you, man.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.997 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
not a joke, then?

00:20:45.997 --> 00:20:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Your audience's
eyes would glaze over

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
if I give you all the details.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Suffice to say I
did five minutes

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:55.390 align:middle line:84%
before go time damage control,
patched it back together,

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and I made it happen.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But when Senator
Harry Reid arrived,

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.890 align:middle line:90%
it was like an entourage.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.515 align:middle line:84%
Like, you knew someone important
had just walked into the room.

00:21:02.515 --> 00:21:05.275 align:middle line:84%
He had this big guy
that would look at me.

00:21:05.275 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Any time I went near
him, I'd get permission.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Can I stand next
to him, you know?

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And he's kind of watching
me the whole time.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, no, no.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.468 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: This is his job.

00:21:11.468 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I guess he's former
Senate Majority Leader.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:90%
He's got security.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:90%
They've got to watch him.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I didn't want to
push his comfort zone,

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know where
his comfort zone was.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And at any moment, he could
just get up and walk out.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.075 align:middle line:84%
So I was very careful in my
approach and kind of feeling

00:21:26.075 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:90%
him out a little bit.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.900 align:middle line:90%
And he had a very narrow--

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:90%
like, his window of time was--

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:30.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 48 minutes.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it looks like
he didn't hold back, though.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: No.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Coming in, we're going out.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And so when things started
to get more relaxed,

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought, let me push
the envelope a little bit,

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and let me see how much
I can get out of him.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
said, hey, let me--

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.837 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing Gordon
Cooper, mercury astronaut

00:21:49.837 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Gordon Cooper in the '90s.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.878 align:middle line:84%
And he told me about this
landing incident that

00:21:52.878 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:84%
happened at Edwards Air
Force Base circa 1957,

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.860 align:middle line:90%
and it was filmed.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And the film footage was
handed off to a courier jet

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.190 align:middle line:90%
from Washington.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Where is that stuff?

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:90%
And he finishes my sentence.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:90%
And he says, hey, you know?

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was never seen
or heard from again.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.980 align:middle line:90%
I went, exactly.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
are you suggesting

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
that there's evidence that
hasn't seen the light of day?

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And he takes a sip
of his water, and you

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:90%
could tell he was thinking.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:90%
The moment seemed pregnant.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was a paused moment.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But then he says, I'm saying
that most of the evidence--

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:84%
I think he just said,
to heck with it.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.527 align:middle line:90%
Let's let it out.

00:22:25.527 --> 00:22:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, he's retired now.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:90%
So have we lost an ally here?

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: No, he's still
working behind the scenes.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is he?

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Oh, yes, he is.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And so here's
where we are today.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:84%
We know through Elizondo and
the likes of Mellon and Senator

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Reid and a handful of others--

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These are the To the
Stars Academy group, right?

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, yes and no.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:84%
I think they've kind of
part ways a little bit.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Amicably.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there's lots of
evidence, photographic evidence

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:90%
that has not been released.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
evidence, I've even

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.770 align:middle line:84%
spoken to the people that have
seen it, that this is something

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.900 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going after,
that we're going after,

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.512 align:middle line:84%
and that's apparently
objects going

00:23:09.512 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
in and out of the oceans
that were photographed

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:84%
by Navy pilots, one of which
I'm told was 50 feet away.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:84%
A very, very large
triangular-shaped

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:84%
UFO that came out of the ocean
and went straight up to space.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Just-- [WHOOSH].

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.762 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And some of our
ships have been followed

00:23:24.762 --> 00:23:27.345 align:middle line:90%
underwater, submerged UFOs.

00:23:27.345 --> 00:23:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Got things
underwater too.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.927 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
that we know about,

00:23:30.927 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:90%
that we know it exists.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:10%
And so our objective
is to continue our push

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:10%
for transparency,
continue reporting

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:10%
on what's happening today,
because this is a developing

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.070 align:middle line:10%
story.

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.840 align:middle line:84%
These things are
unfolding, right?

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to start
documenting what's happening.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.920 align:middle line:90%
And there's a new task force.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
There's people
within the task force

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that would like to have
more government transparency.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:84%
They just need to know here from
us, the general public, hey--

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:90%
they need an incentive.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:90%
So we're going after it.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.558 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what happened
that some of the schools?

00:24:01.558 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I noticed you had
kids in the trailer.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was going on?

00:24:05.275 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Was that in Australia?

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: So there were
two landing cases

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that I cover in the
film at schools.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.990 align:middle line:84%
One of them happened
thanks to Paola Harris,

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
who turned me on to this
gentleman, James Rigney,

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:84%
in 1966 at Westall, which
is a suburb of Melbourne.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Australia.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Australia.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:31.443 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
hard to imagine--

00:24:31.443 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
your audience is

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.330 align:middle line:84%
well briefed on
the topic of UFOs,

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.450 align:middle line:84%
but I personally had a
difficult time thinking

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:39.940 align:middle line:84%
that a landing could occur
at a school with hundreds

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.568 align:middle line:90%
of witnesses in broad daylight--

00:24:41.568 --> 00:24:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And nobody
hear anything about it.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.235 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And the whole
world not know about it.

00:24:45.235 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So I always kind
of was a little bit

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:90%
suspicious about these things.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:50.275 align:middle line:84%
But I went to Australia,
and I met the witnesses.

00:24:50.275 --> 00:24:51.400 align:middle line:90%
I went to the landing site.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are all
grown up now, right?

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Who are all grown up now.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And that Westall
1966 UFO landing case

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely phenomenal.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's--

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.198 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened?

00:25:02.198 --> 00:25:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: It was right around
morning recess, about 10:00 AM.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, in the United
States, it was I think April 4.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
With the time difference, there
were congressional hearings--

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's like
a 15-hour difference.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yeah.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:84%
So there were
congressional hearings.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And I figured this
out in the edit room.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.375 align:middle line:84%
There were
congressional hearings

00:25:20.375 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:84%
that we covered 1966 with Dr.
Hynek, Secretary of the Air

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.917 align:middle line:90%
This is all happening.

00:25:25.917 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And as those hearings
were coming to an end

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and they were walking out
of the halls of Congress,

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:90%
a UFO lands at a school.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: I swear to you, yes.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.275 align:middle line:90%
Look at the dates.

00:25:35.275 --> 00:25:39.910 align:middle line:84%
A UFO's landing at a school
at 10:00 in the morning.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:90%
10:30, something like this.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And there were
literally, according

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.607 align:middle line:84%
to the science teacher
who I interviewed

00:25:44.607 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and all the witnesses, 300-plus
witnesses standing outside

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:84%
in broad daylight, watching
this craft maneuver.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes and it
lands outside of the school

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.950 align:middle line:84%
playgrounds, but in
a part of the area

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
where the children
would run track.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:90%
It was like a grove of trees.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And so a bunch of kids
jumped the fence--

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and against the will of
the teachers-- they just--

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.302 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
chasing the UFO?

00:26:08.302 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: And they ran after where
it landed, and there it was,

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:90%
sitting on the ground.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:13.720 align:middle line:84%
They got within
10, 12 feet of it.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I interview those
people in the movie.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.180 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely incredible.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
How many witnesses do you
know that come within 10

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.530 align:middle line:90%
feet of a landing craft?

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not many.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: In broad daylight
with hundreds of witnesses?

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the UFO
doesn't escape or take off.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: It sat there for a
moment, and then it lifts off.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And it had perfectly
glow colors--

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it
wanted them to see it.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Of course.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, yeah.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.130 align:middle line:90%
It landed.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It goes up off the
ground like this,

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and then it turns this
way, and then rockets out

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.655 align:middle line:90%
of sight they said like--

00:26:42.655 --> 00:26:43.985 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like sideways?

00:26:43.985 --> 00:26:44.785 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yeah.

00:26:44.785 --> 00:26:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It went up off the ground
like this, and it pivots.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting
thing about this case

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.980 align:middle line:84%
is that there was a
gentleman two days earlier.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know when you look
into UFO accounts, especially

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.620 align:middle line:84%
very good ones like the
one I'm talking about now,

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:90%
there's usually a wave.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.760 align:middle line:84%
There's usually a sighting
period of several days

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.000 align:middle line:84%
prior and after that you'll
get reports of the same craft.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a gentleman who
lived about 12 to 17 kilometers

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:84%
away who took a
photograph of it,

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and he described it
exactly the same way,

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:12.633 align:middle line:84%
that it kind of
floated down like this.

00:27:12.633 --> 00:27:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And then right
before it took off,

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:84%
it pivoted straight up and down
and then went and shot off.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:84%
He said like a gun
leaving the barrel--

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.130 align:middle line:84%
like a bullet leaving
the barrel of a gun.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:22.755 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
take a closer look

00:27:22.755 --> 00:27:24.970 align:middle line:84%
at what some of them said
when you interviewed them.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Excellent.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:10%
>> For the first time
in nearly 20 years,

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.020 align:middle line:10%
the aerial schoolchildren
gathered from the four corners

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.560 align:middle line:10%
of the world to talk to each
other about the experience they

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.627 align:middle line:10%
shared that September morning.

00:27:37.627 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SALMA SIDDICK: I
remember something there.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>> One they all still
struggle to understand.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIM: You know that
it's moving, but you--

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SIDDICK: I stand
by what I saw.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:53.107 align:middle line:10%
There was no reason for
any of us to make that up.

00:27:53.107 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:10%
>>EMMA JELIC KRISTIANSEN: I've
not spoken to anybody about it,

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.607 align:middle line:10%
not because I'm not proud
of it, but because I

00:27:57.607 --> 00:28:02.670 align:middle line:10%
don't want the stigma.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:10%
>>LISIL FIELD: So it's
something that I've

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.802 align:middle line:10%
had to deal with for
19 and 1/2 years.

00:28:09.802 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SIDDICK: I don't want to
say I felt like I knew it,

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that I didn't
have to be afraid of it.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>> They took us back to
the moment of contact.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KRISTIANSEN: Exactly
how I felt. Exactly.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The details still
seared into memory.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KRISTIANSEN: I was with
one of the other girls

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:27.635 align:middle line:84%
and saying to her,
this is amazing.

00:28:27.635 --> 00:28:29.260 align:middle line:10%
>>KAYLEIGH VAN DRUTEN:
We all were just

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:10%
stopped in our tracks.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.500 align:middle line:10%
>>KUDZANAI MUNYA:
The little man appear

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:10%
on top of the actual craft.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And that moment for
me was very distinct,

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:84%
because I was like,
that's not human.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.680 align:middle line:10%
>>EMILY TRIM: Well, I was
just completely engulfed

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:10%
in these eyes.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.323 align:middle line:90%
>>SIDDICK: The eyes.

00:28:46.323 --> 00:28:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
however long it

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
was, because I have no
idea of the time frame,

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.220 align:middle line:84%
it was just-- it
was mesmerizing.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIM: There was no
talking, and it's all just

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.070 align:middle line:90%
images in the head.

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.392 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.392 --> 00:29:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're all
grown up now, aren't they?

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: So basically,
I look at that footage

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and I think about my previous
film, "I know What I Saw."

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.305 align:middle line:84%
And it almost got picked
up by Lionsgate, which

00:29:11.305 --> 00:29:12.430 align:middle line:90%
would have been a massive--

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, that
would have been huge.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Huge.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Not just their distribution
platform, but the money.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything would
have been great.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And last minute they took a
pass, and I was devastated.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And they said-- and I ended
up selling to A&E, but anyway.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said, your
production qualities

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:84%
were just not quite
up to standard.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So when I look at that footage
now-- because when I shot this,

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm hiring
the top camera guys,

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:90%
the top cameras, the top audio.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.938 align:middle line:84%
And I want it to look
like "60 Minutes."

00:29:40.938 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And I look at that,
and I'm like, I did it.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did it.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: I did it.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.673 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You did it.

00:29:44.673 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yeah.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And I remember at the
time trying to talk my--

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.230 align:middle line:90%
this guy, investor in.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.122 align:middle line:84%
He says, a UFO landed in a
school and the occupants got

00:29:53.122 --> 00:29:54.830 align:middle line:84%
out and the whole
world doesn't-- no way.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:90%
I said, just please, listen.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Hear me out.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you
think there's a cover-up?

00:30:00.655 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: I feel very comfortable
answering this question.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:08.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't expose what
you know without exposing

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.140 align:middle line:90%
your vulnerabilities.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can't expose what
you know without exposing

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:90%
what you don't know.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then you
also have to say why

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.850 align:middle line:90%
you lied over all these years.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Well, of course.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:90%
But it actually makes sense.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.370 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it
from their standpoint,

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:26.157 align:middle line:84%
if you're in charge of
controlling the airspace

00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and you've got these
unknown objects--

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
can't control it.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.733 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: --and you can't control
it, you going to disclose that?

00:30:31.733 --> 00:30:33.955 align:middle line:84%
So you have to say,
hey, by the way,

00:30:33.955 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:84%
it's been brought
to my attention

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.413 align:middle line:84%
that there are these unknown
craft whizzing around

00:30:37.413 --> 00:30:38.300 align:middle line:90%
with impunity.

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.370 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea
who they are, where

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.940 align:middle line:90%
they come from, what they want.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.307 align:middle line:84%
And you know, they run rings
around our fastest jets.

00:30:44.307 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
abducting people.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: Yeah, there's that
element too, potentially.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:90%
So you know, I get--

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.560 align:middle line:84%
I understand why the
secrecy, but I think

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:90%
it's time this is coming out.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.910 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of momentum happening.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.498 align:middle line:84%
I think everything
changed from 2017

00:31:01.498 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:84%
with the front page of
"The New York Times"

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.930 align:middle line:84%
reporting that secret
Pentagon UFO program, AATIP,

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that former Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid--

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:11.720 align:middle line:84%
whether you're on
his side politically

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.010 align:middle line:90%
or not doesn't matter.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Someone of his
stature coming forward

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and basically confirming
what we already expected.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who pushed
him, Bigelow?

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: He's got a great
relationship with Bigelow.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.900 align:middle line:84%
But what got him to
totally come forward?

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.675 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think people just
get to a point where they say,

00:31:28.675 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to no longer
worry about the repercussions.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:32.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody
taught him something.

00:31:32.675 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Somebody taught him
the fact that there's

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.870 align:middle line:84%
been a cover-up, because I
don't think he knew this.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: He had a
level of pushback

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:90%
in the intelligence community.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.375 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the things
he admitted to me on camera.

00:31:43.375 --> 00:31:45.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, I just want
to get this project launched.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to look
into the UAP phenomenon.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.795 align:middle line:90%
We're going to look.

00:31:49.795 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And he had a tremendous
amount of pushback, which

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.758 align:middle line:90%
he said was quite surprising.

00:31:53.758 --> 00:31:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mentioned
Richard Dolan.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Great ufologist, and
he was on "Open Minds"

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.650 align:middle line:90%
talking about the cover-ups.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yeah.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Let's take
it back to where a lot of this

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.303 align:middle line:10%
really started, at least
the US part of the story.

00:32:05.303 --> 00:32:07.570 align:middle line:10%
Different in Germany and
the Soviet Union, but let's

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:10%
start at Roswell.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.520 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: Mm-hmm.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, Roswell is
in a lot of ways

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.260 align:middle line:84%
where it's appropriate
to start there.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Something happened at Roswell,
something very, very important.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.303 align:middle line:84%
And look, to this day
there are multiple--

00:32:20.303 --> 00:32:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say
two, but really there

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.460 align:middle line:84%
are more than two sides
of the Roswell debate.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.100 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of nuance in this.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I do come down on the side
that there was an event.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it extraterrestrial.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it wasn't.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't us.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what I will say.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.680 align:middle line:84%
In the book "AD," Bryce and
I use the phrase the others,

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.570 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
really know that they

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:41.990 align:middle line:90%
are truly extraterrestrial.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.630 align:middle line:90%
I think that they are.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:48.430 align:middle line:84%
What happened at Roswell is that
during the height of the flying

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:51.790 align:middle line:84%
saucer wave that was
overtaking the United States--

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.010 align:middle line:84%
it was a big, big--
lots of talk about this.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:84%
In the midst of that, the
United States Army Air Force

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.470 align:middle line:84%
stated to the world
that they had recovered

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:06.993 align:middle line:84%
one of those flying disks
outside Roswell, New Mexico,

00:33:06.993 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and then three hours later
retracted the whole thing

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.960 align:middle line:90%
and said, oh, no.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Just a weather balloon.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Sorry for the confusion.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And then that story
died for 30 years

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
until it was resurrected by a
number of researchers who found

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.910 align:middle line:90%
some of the original witnesses.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.495 align:middle line:84%
Roswell I think
absolutely happened,

00:33:24.495 --> 00:33:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's a
good starting point.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:90%
So let's just say that it did.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So you're the president
of the United States.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:90%
You're Harry Truman.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And let's say I'm your top
general or scientific advisor.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And I will come to
you and say, sir,

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.030 align:middle line:84%
we have recovered
technology that

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.130 align:middle line:84%
does not appear to
have been manufactured

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.305 align:middle line:90%
by our civilization.

00:33:44.305 --> 00:33:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
where it starts.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
you're being told

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:84%
not simply that there are
these objects out there,

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.560 align:middle line:84%
but that we got some
of that technology.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this heavy-duty
decision to think about.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Do you tell the world?

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:03.310 align:middle line:84%
It's quite possible that
your instinct might have

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.110 align:middle line:90%
been the world should know.

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.180 align:middle line:10%
But then you'd think
about it, or your advisors

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.620 align:middle line:10%
like me would talk
to you about it

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.739 align:middle line:10%
and you'd realize that if
you told the world you had

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:10%
this exotic technology, then
it becomes very difficult

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.120 align:middle line:10%
not to share it.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.287 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Well, I was
just going to bring that up.

00:34:18.287 --> 00:34:19.989 align:middle line:10%
There's one big incentive, yes.

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: I mean, after all,
you've got the incipient Cold

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.590 align:middle line:10%
War taking place.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.530 align:middle line:10%
The Soviet Union and the United
States were not friendly.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.030 align:middle line:10%
And then other
nations in the world,

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.488 align:middle line:10%
maybe you don't
want to share this.

00:34:29.488 --> 00:34:32.695 align:middle line:10%
And the other thing is it's
very likely that they would not

00:34:32.695 --> 00:34:34.570 align:middle line:10%
have had a whole lot of
information about who

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.247 align:middle line:10%
these other beings were anyway.

00:34:36.247 --> 00:34:38.080 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go tell
the world about this

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.538 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going to have
to answer a lot of questions.

00:34:40.538 --> 00:34:42.190 align:middle line:84%
You may not have
the information.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: James, Dolan's right.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.159 align:middle line:90%
He's right.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.645 align:middle line:90%
There is that cover-up.

00:34:46.645 --> 00:34:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And that could have been
some of the reasons.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: If they did indeed--

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and I believe they
did-- recover hardware--

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.360 align:middle line:84%
whether they've successfully
reverse engineered it or not,

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.215 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:56.215 --> 00:34:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Some people are quite
confident that we have.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:58.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:34:59.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we have.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some of it we have.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You haven't
stumbled across it.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: But you can't
share it with your friends

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.360 align:middle line:84%
without sharing it
with your enemies.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:90%
I totally get that part.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, that makes sense.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is your mission?

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.520 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to happen?

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: I can't turn my
back on it at this stage.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I feel like as much as I'd like
to kick back and put my feet up

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy the fruits
of my hard labor

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.790 align:middle line:84%
with "The Phenomenon"
success, I feel

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:24.970 align:middle line:84%
like I have to kind of
maintain the momentum

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.857 align:middle line:84%
and keep contributing
to push governments,

00:35:27.857 --> 00:35:29.440 align:middle line:84%
because I know there's
a lot of people

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.773 align:middle line:84%
within different governments
around the world that would

00:35:31.773 --> 00:35:33.640 align:middle line:90%
like to see the story come out.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.665 align:middle line:90%
They just need to know.

00:35:35.665 --> 00:35:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Like, give you an example.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.817 align:middle line:84%
When I talk with
elected officials,

00:35:39.817 --> 00:35:42.400 align:middle line:84%
they say, look, we're not going
to have congressional hearings

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.100 align:middle line:84%
unless our cages are rattled
from our constituents.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.780 align:middle line:84%
We need to hear from
our constituents.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.550 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
put our necks out,

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:84%
talking about something
that's not quite

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.187 align:middle line:90%
considered career-enhancing.

00:35:52.187 --> 00:35:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They need
to know that they--

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: They need to know
that they have our support,

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:90%
so they need to hear from us.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So I would just like to see more
government transparency, more

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:84%
front page news articles
releasing evidence,

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.203 align:middle line:84%
releasing the existence
of these programs

00:36:06.203 --> 00:36:07.870 align:middle line:84%
for the general public
around the world,

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:84%
because I think that every man,
woman, and child is entitled

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.390 align:middle line:90%
to this story--

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will we get that?

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: --whether it's
a little scary or not.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.240 align:middle line:90%
I think we're getting it.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at
what's happening.

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:18.940 align:middle line:84%
We got the front page
"The New York Times."

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:19.740 align:middle line:90%
We got the--

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.968 align:middle line:84%
>>FOX: We've got the admission
of this official evidence.

00:36:23.968 --> 00:36:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've got our
backing on "Coast to Coast"

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.120 align:middle line:90%
and "Beyond Belief."

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:27.920 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: It's not the best--

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, the best evidence
is still out there,

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:90%
and we're going after it.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But I want further government
transparency around the world.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:39.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
see "The Phenomenon?"

00:36:39.375 --> 00:36:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Good question.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to rent it,
just Google "The Phenomenon."

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.500 align:middle line:84%
It's on a multitude
of platforms.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And just obviously, find the
least expensive platform,

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.820 align:middle line:90%
like $3.99 or $4.99.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to buy it,
buy it from iTunes or Vimeo.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.520 align:middle line:84%
It comes with three
hours of bonus material

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.170 align:middle line:90%
at no additional cost.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:58.170 align:middle line:84%
They just don't offer it
on the other platforms.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's great
for anybody who is into UFOs

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and wants to really get
to the bottom of this.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Yes.

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a call to action
at the end of the film.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.900 align:middle line:84%
You can contact
your representative,

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.370 align:middle line:84%
say we want to push for further
government transparency.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:13.200 align:middle line:10%
We have a website,
thephenomenonfilm.com

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.090 align:middle line:10%
And we would love it if
people would take the time

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:17.890 align:middle line:10%
and rate the film.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.380 align:middle line:84%
It's tremendously helpful
for other platforms

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.820 align:middle line:84%
to see that it's rating
well and it gets out there.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.403 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
the general public

00:37:24.403 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
can do to help get the
word out, is just to go

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:28.113 align:middle line:90%
and simply rate the film.

00:37:28.113 --> 00:37:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: James, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FOX: Thanks for having me.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.222 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late "New
York Times" science writer

00:37:33.222 --> 00:37:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Walter Sullivan wrote a book
once called "We Are Not Alone."

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.220 align:middle line:10%
And after looking at
snippets of the documentary

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.570 align:middle line:10%
"The Phenomenon," I'm
convinced we are not alone.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
