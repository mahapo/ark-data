>>GEROGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:10%
a very special
guest for you today.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:10%
Bree Melanson is a channel
and spiritual teacher

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:10%
who supports others in accessing
their own ability to receive

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:10%
higher intelligence, self-heal,
and manifest with the field.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Bree.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:90%
It's been a while.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BREE MELANSON: Thank you.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Pretty good.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Happy to be here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Such an honor and a gift.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's always great
to have you on the program.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:84%
You bring a special gift with
you whenever you're here.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's the gift of your
ability to teach us more things.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: It's my
greatest passion.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People seem
to be fascinated

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:90%
with ETs, spirituality.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.107 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Good question.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:10%
I think-- I believe
that, I guess,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.489 align:middle line:10%
all of our curiosities
and our desires

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:10%
are driven by our desire
to remember our wholeness

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.030 align:middle line:10%
and to expand and to grow.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:10%
And I think probably
more specifically

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:10%
with our fascination with
ETs and the metaphysical,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.760 align:middle line:10%
it's an inner knowing
and remembrance

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:10%
that we have of the greater
aspect of who we are

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:10%
and our greater potential.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's what really
pulls us underneath all

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:90%
the shiny things.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.968 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
all connected.

00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
They're all intertwined,
aren't they?

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we are energetic beings.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:90%
We are sentient beings.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:90%
We can at least attest to that.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And more and more, thanks
to things like Gaia,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:84%
we are opening and,
I guess through Gaia,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:84%
creating more
pathways for people

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:90%
to understand our connection.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a healer.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:90%
You're a spiritualist.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:90%
What do you prefer to be?

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Just Bree.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Just Bree.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think we're
all healers in a way

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
no matter if you're a
host, or an energy worker,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:90%
or a teacher, or mechanic.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all here
to support each other

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.157 align:middle line:90%
as like this greater macrocosm.

00:02:19.157 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have
to train ourselves

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:90%
to be these kinds of healers?

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: It takes a
remembrance, for sure.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.866 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't come
out seeing through walls.

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, I would
talk about certain things.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:90%
And I was always--

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
were born this way.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah,
we think we all are.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we all have some
type of remembrance.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And even just with kids, you
see how open they are to magic

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and how active their
imaginations are.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all
come in with that--

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
essentially like that
light and that remembrance.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, a lot of
times, we're not

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
taught how to use those
tools or given pathways.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.945 align:middle line:90%
But it's within all of us.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's impossible
for it not to be.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet, some are
better than others.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I think it has
to do with our purpose.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And I also don't like to give
too much weight to that word.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It's really about following
what lights us up,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:84%
what we're curious about, what
brings us life force energy.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I think for me,
specifically, I always

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:84%
had a real draw to
this and curiosity.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know
how it could look.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So I never thought
that I would be here.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:84%
But it was really
just a-- it's been

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
a result of following
those curiosities

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and what I was drawn
to all my life.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.787 align:middle line:84%
And so I think if part
of your divine makeup

00:03:47.787 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
is around being a musician,
you're going to feel a draw.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:90%
And you might be naturally--

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: --better at playing.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But we all-- intuition is
really a survival skill.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.910 align:middle line:84%
But I would say it
probably has more

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:84%
to do with that kind of like
innate imprint that we all have.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been
the most profound episode

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:84%
you've had in your career
that even astounded you?

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, I never
ceased to be amazed by things.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.162 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, go
ahead and tell us.

00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: It's this moment.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.150 align:middle line:90%
It's this very moment.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I taught at a prison recently.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And gosh, it makes me cry.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.652 align:middle line:90%
It's a love tear.

00:04:33.652 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to move through it.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:90%
One second.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
getting emotional.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah,
I just-- it's part

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.272 align:middle line:84%
of being in your heart,
unfortunately or fortunately.

00:04:44.272 --> 00:04:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good thing.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah,
it's a good thing.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes
it's like our body is

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.640 align:middle line:84%
processing the levels of love
that are kind of integrating.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I taught at a prison.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And I facilitated
breathwork for them.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But we started with
a bit of a class

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:84%
just around emotions
and the mind.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And watching, I think,
even just their reactions

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.320 align:middle line:90%
was quite profound.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And their answers
were quite deep.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But it was such a
beautiful example

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:84%
of the greater the contrast
and hardship that we have,

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
the greater potential for our
healing and our transcendence.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So the breathwork that
I use and facilitate

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of my programs and
classes is quite somatic.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And it can bring you to
really transcendental states.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this like
Wim Hof's breath?

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: It's similar-- yeah,
it's a different technique.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.463 align:middle line:84%
But it gets you
to the same place.

00:05:40.463 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same results?

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.155 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, you
do it laying down.

00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:84%
It tends to be a little
bit more intense in a way.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And watching some of
them move through--

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:90%
like that had severe PTSD.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the older
gentlemen said that it usually

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:84%
takes him like hours
to get back to normal

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.670 align:middle line:90%
if he visits what happened.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And he totally like went
there within the breathwork

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and then came out of it in this
like euphoric state of peace

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:90%
and really couldn't believe it.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen people heal from
chronic diagnosed conditions

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and years of pain really through
like one breathwork session.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So it provides-- the technology
of our bodies is so profound.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're scratching
the surface.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think probably one
of the greatest gifts

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.635 align:middle line:90%
is like seeing people transform.

00:06:31.635 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bree, you're an expert
on Gaia's original series

"Channeling," where you
talk about the importance

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.770 align:middle line:90%
of connecting to the heart.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.615 align:middle line:90%

>>MATIAS DE STEFANO:
When we started

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:10%
the path of spirituality, the
first thing that everyone says

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:10%
is you have to get
rid of the ego.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
The ego is the one
that has been helping

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:84%
you to survive for millions
of years in this planet.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:10%
So when we speak
about channeling,

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:10%
which is letting other
energies go through me,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:10%
the ego says, wait a moment,
But is this going to kill me?

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:90%
So you cannot get rid of ego.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:90%
That's dying.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But what you can do is not leave
it in control of everything.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.490 align:middle line:84%
That's why everyone talks
about going to the heart.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart doesn't
judge what it's going through.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And the heart basically is
channeling in every bit.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So the system of the heart has
been designed for channeling.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Blood goes through,
oxygen, vitamins.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Anything that the
cells need to survive

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:43.360 align:middle line:84%
go through the
channel of the heart.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why, spiritually, we can
say we need to go to the heart

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:53.745 align:middle line:84%
in order to let us set free
from the ego and be more free.

00:07:53.745 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:02.686 align:middle line:10%
>>MELANSON: Within the
opening of the heart

00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:08.560 align:middle line:10%
and the practice of service,
not just the intention,

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:10%
this is where you dissipate all
barricades that you have created

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.830 align:middle line:10%
through your own perception.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:90%
[END OF PLAYBACK]

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think of that?

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: The heart,
it's a good place to live.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I think our freest,
most heart-filled expression

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.520 align:middle line:84%
will always be our most abundant
expression, our most healed

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:90%
expression.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I love how Matías
talks about just

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:84%
that parallel of a
physical heart being

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:84%
this channel for our
ability to be here

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and also our channel for
source or intelligence.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
As we were talking
about earlier,

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:90%
we really are sentient beings.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And intelligence is a matter of
energy and a sentient nature.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think we get a
little bit tripped up

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:84%
when we make emotions bad or
good or trying to avoid them.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And really, our channel is
our core and center for--

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:24.125 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, our heart is
our channel for creation.

00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had Howard Martin
on my "Coast to Coast"

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:84%
radio show from HeartMath, who
was convinced that the heart is

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:37.110 align:middle line:84%
a living, breathing organ, not
just as a heart but almost like

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.367 align:middle line:90%
a brain center.

00:09:38.367 --> 00:09:39.450 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.867 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: He's
absolutely right.

00:09:40.867 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I have one of the
HeartMath tools

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:84%
that I've played around with
to find heart coherence.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It's our center
for intelligence.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And really, the mind
is really just meant

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:90%
to translate that information.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
We are always taking in
information energetically

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:90%
on a sentient level.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the more we
can learn how to keep

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:84%
that channel open
and our communication

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
open with our
heart, our emotions

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
are really just telling us where
we stand in relation to source.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:90%
They're like feedback.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So we get stuck
when we, again, make

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
emotions bad versus just
recognizing the essence of truth

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:90%
is harmonious.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:90%
We are innately harmonious.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And how we feel
is letting us know

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
where we are resonating
from or the beliefs

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that we're holding in relation
to truth or source or harmony.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bree, from
these other dimensions--

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:90%
and there are many--

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.400 align:middle line:84%
what do we learn from
these dimensional beings?

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well,
they seem to be--

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:84%
other than having that kind
of sense of remembrance

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and the beauty and
curiosity, they

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
seem to be pretty consistent
with their messaging in that we

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:84%
are infinite creators and
the energy of creation

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:84%
moves within us, that our
thoughts direct that source

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So that is how we use
divine, creative energy

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:84%
through the thoughts that we
elect to uphold and project.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the greatest illusion
is that we are separate,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that we're separate from
each other or them or source

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:90%
or environment or nature.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So even though they share
so much beautiful knowledge,

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
it feels like the
consistency of their message

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:84%
is kind of within
those three things.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're hearing a lot
these days about disclosure.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Is it real or otherwise?

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And what about reverse
engineering, where, apparently,

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
we have technology given to
us by other ETs or dimensional

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:90%
beings?

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:90%
And we've created it.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:90%
We've turned it into things.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.582 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:11:59.582 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: It's fascinating.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was channeling recently
in like a class setting.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:90%
And somebody asked about it.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And what they shared was to
notice what feels like home.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So as these things are being
presented and moving forward

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:84%
in the future, so much
is being revealed.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And both that is true
and that is not true.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And our job is to feel into,
they put it, what felt like home

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:84%
or what felt
harmonious or coherent.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So I think moving forward
in the future, our ability

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
to access our intuition,
use discernment, and be

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.085 align:middle line:84%
able to adapt are going
to be the greatest

00:12:49.085 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:90%
students of them all.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel,
Bree, that people

00:12:51.585 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
are opening up more
to spirituality

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.593 align:middle line:90%
and this entire field?

00:12:55.593 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: It
sure seems like it.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.282 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm like
wink, wink, Gaia.

00:13:00.282 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're on it.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.040 align:middle line:90%
They're on it.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.406 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:13:03.406 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, definitely.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, also, with hardship and
chaos, we ask bigger questions.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:14.303 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:13:14.303 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
It's when we're moving
through hardship,

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:84%
we're looking for higher
solutions and higher

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's also an
undeniable shift that's

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:90%
happening that we're feeling.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's a matter of
ideally getting on the wave.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did these
messages come to us

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:84%
though in a form of
clairvoyance and intuition?

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem to be
a direct, hey, folks,

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.090 align:middle line:90%
this is what's going on.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Do this.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:90%
You'll have a better life.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not that way.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:90%
It's more surreal.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.020 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, intelligence--
if we look to nature,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
I always like to
use that example.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.750 align:middle line:84%
We can see that there is
a connective tissue that's

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle line:84%
creating harmony,
that is intelligent.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we are also-- it's,
again, impossible for us

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:84%
not to be connected to
that field of intelligence.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And so when we connect with
our intrinsic essence or our--

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
let's just say
when we can manage

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
to get past our thoughts, that's
when inspiration comes in.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:90%
That's when guidance comes in.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:90%
That's when clarity comes in.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's not easy to
get through those thoughts,

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:90%
is it?

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Not easy.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, it
really takes being

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
willing to trade those
thoughts and our attachments

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
to the identity for
our infinite potential.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be willing
to direct our thoughts

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:84%
towards where we want
to go and the expression

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.700 align:middle line:90%
that we're wanting to be.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do most
people "get it?"

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.922 align:middle line:90%
Do they understand these?

00:14:51.922 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: The messages or--

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The messages
and concepts?

00:14:55.070 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I think
truth reaches all of us

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
in the ways that it can
and that it's supposed to.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And from my experience with
the interdimensional beings

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:84%
or angels or any way that
I connect intuitively,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.180 align:middle line:84%
they share messages
that are empowering,

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.820 align:middle line:90%
that support our evolution.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And so they're never
telling us what to do

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:90%
or what to be afraid of.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
most important piece,

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:84%
is that they are trying to help
us to resonate with the greater

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
wisdom or truth so
that we can make

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:84%
the changes because otherwise
we're not actually embodying

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.067 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom or the change.

00:15:44.067 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is the flow state?

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Flow is our
ability to break free

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
from the identity
and the thoughts

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and feel the essence of, really,
our soul and our greater self.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And when we are
in that state, we

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:10.410 align:middle line:84%
are connected to, as you might
say, the intelligent field.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Our intrinsic essence, like
the most innate essence

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:84%
of who we are, is connected
to the field of creation.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And so just by doing things
that get you out of the mind,

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
that get you in your body,
that make you feel alive

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:84%
put you in what we
would call a flow state.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And a flow state is where
we receive guidance,

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.950 align:middle line:84%
where we settle back
into harmony, where

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:90%
we catch inspiration.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And in a lot of ways, I think
it's the most powerful thing

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:45.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can do spiritually, is
to really embody our essence

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.928 align:middle line:84%
and work to create that
coherence within ourselves.

00:16:48.928 --> 00:16:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can everybody do this?

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Can everybody channel?

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I think everybody
is channeling in a way.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:84%
We're all channeling
our own expression.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And the ability for people
to access information

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.910 align:middle line:84%
definitely is
opening a lot more.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a lot more
channels come out and start

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:90%
sharing their gifts.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's also a
really helpful question

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to consider, What does
my life look like when

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I am being a channel for
source or for my soul

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.340 align:middle line:84%
or for love or for the
essence of creation?

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, on the
"Channeling" series,

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.510 align:middle line:84%
you and others talk about the
different types of channeling,

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:90%
which is very important.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.720 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.520 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:10%
>>MELANSON: So we want
you to first acknowledge

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:10%
you are channeling.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
You are channeling the
miraculous through you

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
When you feel love
in your heart,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
when you extend it
to others or as you

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:84%
are in co-creation
in each moment,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:84%
you are channeling divine
source through you.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:90%
This is what you are doing.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:10%
>>DARRYL ANKA: The
philosophy to me

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.600 align:middle line:10%
of being a channel
in the way I am

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:10%
is simply that some people,
for whatever reason,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:10%
have made an agreement
on some level

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:10%
to bring through information
in this particular way

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.860 align:middle line:10%
as a vocal channel.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.700 align:middle line:84%
It is one way of expressing
the art of channeling.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But I want to demystify the idea
so that everyone understands

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:84%
that this is not some strange,
mysterious phenomenon.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.390 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
is natural to humanity.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And really, without even
knowing it, a lot of people

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:90%
do it when they're in the zone.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Different forms of channeling
might require a different focus,

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:90%
a different dedication.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
what you choose to do,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:90%
what you're attracted to.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But if you are attracted
to a specific expression

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.950 align:middle line:84%
of channeling, by following it,
by acting on it to the best you

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:84%
can, it will attract
the synchronicity

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that will bring into your
life the elements, the tools,

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
the techniques, the knowledge,
the information, the people

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that need to be there to help
you move forward on that path.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of self-expanding,
self-guiding, self-correcting.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:12.512 align:middle line:84%
And if you just
act on it, that's

00:19:12.512 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:90%
what starts the ball rolling.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:90%
[END OF PLAYBACK]

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would guess
you would agree with him.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Absolutely.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, It's, again, what
it's-- it's led me here today,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.200 align:middle line:84%
just the simplicity of
following my curiosity.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really
helpful to consider,

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:84%
what are my-- you can just
frame it as my heart's-- what is

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:39.820 align:middle line:84%
my heart's fullest expression
or my heart's greatest desires.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Where is life calling you?

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.660 align:middle line:90%
What fills you with life?

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And those things, of course, are
going to bring more life essence

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.970 align:middle line:90%
to you and on to others.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
self-healing mean to you, Bree?

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, I think
it's essentially a return to--

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.500 align:middle line:84%
all healing is a
return to harmony.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies innately heal.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.990 align:middle line:84%
We are innately
harmonious and whole.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really just a
matter of getting our agencies,

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:17.830 align:middle line:84%
meaning our mind, our body, and
our will, aligned with returning

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:90%
to that wholeness.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:84%
So although there are a
million of healing modalities,

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I think in most
simple terms, it's

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:84%
the return to our
wholeness and our harmony.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When
you're in that mode,

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.748 align:middle line:84%
do you know it when
you're in the groove?

00:20:34.748 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: In the
channeling groove?

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely-- it's
a different state than what

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I feel when I'm say like
when Bree's in her flow state

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:90%
and I feel really aligned.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
However, it's similar in
that the identity leaves.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think those are also our
truest moments and our highest

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:84%
moments, are when the
identity isn't present

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and when we feel kind
of freed from it.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:10%
I think what I love and what
I'm always most lit up by it

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:10%
and impressed by is witnessing
people consciously moving

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.298 align:middle line:10%
towards their healing.

00:21:20.298 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You enjoy seeing that?

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah,
and then experiencing

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that transcendence if
it is a physical healing

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:84%
or if it's just a new state
of empowerment or freedom.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it happen often?

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.477 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, I
mean, I-- and we're

00:21:32.477 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:90%
doing it every day, right?

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:84%
It's in any way that we can
direct the mind more towards,

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:90%
how is this thing here for me?

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.150 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
questions is--

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:90%
well, two.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Part one is, What is true
when I take the identity out?

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So when we are facing
hardship, what's

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.990 align:middle line:84%
true beyond my identities
and investment or opinion?

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:84%
We begin to be able
to see it from a more

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:90%
neutral, harmonious state.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:84%
We can then begin to open to
whatever the higher path may be.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
is just remembering

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.490 align:middle line:84%
that literally all things
exist in the name of expansion

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and evolution.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And so our agency is
being like our mind.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is really
meant to support

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:84%
our evolution and our expansion
and our highest expression.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies don't keep
us separate from source,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.090 align:middle line:90%
that's fake news.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are our
greatest conductors

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.270 align:middle line:90%
and receivers of source energy.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And they are here so that we can
express that energy and expand.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And our will-- our
ability to choose

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:84%
what thoughts we elect
to uphold and how

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:90%
we are using that energy.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And so when we can realize that
everything exists for expansion

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and then when we are
faced with hardship

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.910 align:middle line:84%
to start to gently train
ourselves to look at,

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
How is this thing here
potentially for me?

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.500 align:middle line:84%
as an invitation to expand
or to reach greater harmony,

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.030 align:middle line:90%
we begin to heal.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to
consciously move ourselves

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:90%
towards that harmony.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:10%
So when we have an
issue in the body,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.092 align:middle line:10%
instead of seeing it
as hard as it can be,

00:23:24.092 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:10%
seeing it as a problem,
or we're thinking

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.370 align:middle line:10%
your body is failing you, what
might the body be asking for?

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:10%
How might this be
in support of me

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:10%
reaching a greater
state of harmony

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:10%
or a higher
expression of myself?

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:90%
And the same goes for emotions.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about earlier
with just a feedback system--

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:84%
seeing them as feedback
and then just considering,

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.170 align:middle line:90%
What is this data?

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Telling me how is this
here to direct me?

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:84%
as everything is essentially
directing us, again,

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:84%
to become more whole
and harmonious.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.227 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Bree,
with more and more people

00:23:55.227 --> 00:23:58.710 align:middle line:84%
being tuned into this, why
does it still seem that we

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:90%
live in a chaotic world?

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, we sure do.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You feel?

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah,
especially now, we're all--

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:90%
it does feel heavy.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And what I understand is
that we're being shown--

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:84%
things are being revealed so
that we can choose differently,

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.240 align:middle line:90%
much like our personal patterns.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good example of
sometimes how we approach

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.688 align:middle line:90%
maybe our patterns in our life.

00:24:27.688 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:90%
And we want to get rid of them.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.790 align:middle line:90%
And we want to sage them away.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.700 align:middle line:90%
But really, they're invitations.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.033 align:middle line:84%
And it's really just kind
of like the uni saying,

00:24:36.033 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:90%
do you want to try it again?

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to try it again?

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to show
up differently?

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to show
up differently?

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And so all of this chaos is
really coming to a brink,

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.310 align:middle line:84%
partly because of
this energetic shift

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and also so that we
can choose differently.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And everybody loves a
portal and tell it like--

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:84%
or ascension and
tell it-- squeezes us

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.880 align:middle line:90%
of all of our comforts.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And we really have to
let go of these old ways

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that we've shown
up and that ideally

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
don't serve our growth or
the growth of the collective.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, I'd rather be
part of the awakening community

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.650 align:middle line:90%
than the chaotic community.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.290 align:middle line:84%
How do you get on
the right side?

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, you
use your one agency,

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:90%
your beautiful life force.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think nobody
is exempt from moving

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:84%
through this hardship
and this shift

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.440 align:middle line:84%
that we're moving
through right now.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So no matter how spiritual you
are or what kind of healing work

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:84%
you're doing, we're all having
to really embody and choose

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
our growth because it's
one thing to know that we

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:90%
are an infinite creator.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's another
thing to choose it.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it takes, yeah,
some spiritual muscles.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:10%
But I do think this time
is providing everything

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:10%
that we've been asking for.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Just the difference
is that we're really

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:02.670 align:middle line:84%
having to embody it and show up
as infinite creators versus it

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:84%
just being an idea that
we entertained before.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of the things I
like about Gaia's "Channeling"

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
series is they help
teach us things,

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:84%
telling us what we need and what
we should be doing right now

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.110 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.320 align:middle line:84%
But it also covers the
shift in consciousness,

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.426 align:middle line:90%
which is so important.

00:26:19.426 --> 00:26:20.226 align:middle line:90%

00:26:21.026 --> 00:26:24.195 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: The beautiful thing
about moving through your fears

00:26:24.195 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:84%
if you do want to
connect and you

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.210 align:middle line:84%
have reservations
is that's going

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.560 align:middle line:90%
to transfer into your life.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
become more empowered

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:37.540 align:middle line:84%
in your physical living world
as well as within this aspect

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:90%
of the unknown.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we're honest
with ourselves,

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:84%
we are living in the
unknown all the time.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's where we
dance with source.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's where we create.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:48.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's how we fall in love.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's why we laugh.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So working through those
fears in the metaphysical

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.940 align:middle line:84%
is only going to make
your life more expansive.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.797 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.797 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
It's the awakening.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.680 align:middle line:90%


00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:10%
It's the shift of consciousness,
the shift of limiting beliefs,

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.660 align:middle line:10%
the old ways of being
that have been passed

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:21.070 align:middle line:10%
along generation to generation.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
These old foundations, the old
ways of thinking do not work.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.480 align:middle line:84%
The old structures
and foundations of old

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.890 align:middle line:90%
are crumbling away.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And new will be formed
for a better world yet.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really time for us to
connect together and feel a part

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.580 align:middle line:90%
of this awakening community.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.540 align:middle line:84%
We have to participate
in this bigger picture

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and really be part
of this awakening

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves and for humanity.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.960 align:middle line:10%
>>GILLETTE: I
believe that that's

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:10%
why we're all here, to do just
that, to open up to the greater

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:12.950 align:middle line:10%
us, the greater God's self,
if you would, which will help

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.700 align:middle line:10%
the whole planet
because Theo says,

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:10%
if we recognize who we are,
the divine beings that we are,

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.710 align:middle line:10%
we'll have peace on our planet.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why we've
chosen to be here now

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:84%
in this transformation
of consciousness.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're seeing
such a greater awakening

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.500 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
have an interest in this.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So many people are having
some of their own personal

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.140 align:middle line:90%
experiencing of opening.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:90%
And they want to understand it.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.570 align:middle line:84%
There are many
parts of our world

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:55.550 align:middle line:84%
that people don't have
access, to friends

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:59.690 align:middle line:84%
or family that can believe
in what they're experiencing.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:90%
And they're seeking community.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.400 align:middle line:84%
They're seeking connectivity
and understanding of self.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:90%
[END OF PLAYBACK]

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bree, if we don't
atone to this awakening, what

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.350 align:middle line:90%
happens to us as a people?

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Rough waters.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I think the sooner that we can,
again, accept those invitations

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.760 align:middle line:90%
in our own lives--

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and even when we're looking at
the greater collective chaos,

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.830 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that it is an
invitation for us to show up

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:32.670 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:84%
All of the systems
that are built

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:84%
on linear and individual
incremental gain

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.220 align:middle line:84%
are crumbling because
they're not sustainable.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And we are being
required to really tap

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:54.390 align:middle line:84%
into our ability to innovate
and guide ourselves and adapt

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:90%
to the change.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And it can only happen
in our personal lives.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're given
this beautiful agency.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So the sooner we
can get on board

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:84%
for moving towards
our personal healing,

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:90%
the easier it can become.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And your healed expression
then is really the solution.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And your healed
expression is the most--

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:84%
your most expansive
and free expression.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:90%
So every step we can make.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are religions
getting us to this point?

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: I think what
got us to this point is just

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:84%
a lot of autopilot and ways
that we've unconsciously

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:40.410 align:middle line:84%
looked for external
esteem or safeties.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And when we are looking
outside of ourselves

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.770 align:middle line:84%
for a sense of safety, we
are essentially unsafe.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.010 align:middle line:90%
And the same goes for esteem.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:84%
We give up our own
inner authority

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:84%
when we are looking to
another to fill that.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And that might be an
economic structure.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be somebody else.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think what
it comes down to,

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.350 align:middle line:84%
again, is that forgetfulness
of our incredible ability.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of energy or energies

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
that go into keeping
us forgetful.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Because if we remember
our full power,

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:25.690 align:middle line:84%
then there's no need for
any type of external power

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:26.590 align:middle line:90%
structures.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bree, does fear
hampers some of this?

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Mm-hmm, it's
also the greatest invitation.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:90%
So if we use fear--

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.177 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:31:36.177 --> 00:31:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yes, if we
use fear as our guide,

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.510 align:middle line:84%
it's really the quickest
route to our freedom

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.600 align:middle line:90%
and our transcendence.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So fear, also in moving
through it, is an ego death.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And the ego isn't so bad.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:90%
It is our amigo.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.710 align:middle line:84%
We are supposed
to create with it.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:84%
We're just not supposed
to lead with it.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.850 align:middle line:84%
But an awareness that
when fear comes up,

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:04.510 align:middle line:84%
that illusion of our
separation is at play.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, just the feeling
of fear is guidance.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:84%
It's letting us know that
we are kind of off track

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:90%
to our inherent harmony.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:16.570 align:middle line:10%
And so as we become
curious as to what

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.490 align:middle line:10%
happens when I move--
what's possible

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:24.580 align:middle line:10%
when I move beyond this fear and
even how is the identity looking

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:28.360 align:middle line:10%
to assure itself
through the external

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:10%
and just taking a
soft accountability

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:10%
of the conditioned self
that experiences fear

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.610 align:middle line:10%
has like these
unconscious negotiations

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:37.970 align:middle line:10%
with the external world.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So I have to play
small to be safe.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Or I have to please
others to be loved.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Or there's always this
negotiation that's going on.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we can
understand what's at play

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and what's keeping
those fears in place

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and then, again,
become curious as

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:58.210 align:middle line:84%
to what is possible beyond this,
what is true beyond my identity,

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:02.380 align:middle line:84%
beyond my investment in
this external illusion,

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:07.300 align:middle line:84%
we begin to break free
from fear and experience

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:10.300 align:middle line:84%
more of our wholeness
and our liberation.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, ego
deaths for the win.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:14.170 align:middle line:90%
They're not comfortable.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:14.970 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
channel, how do you

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.425 align:middle line:90%
know what you're channeling?

00:33:18.425 --> 00:33:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, my
job is always just

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:25.600 align:middle line:84%
to get out of the way, which
is the ultimate ego death.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm still getting used
to how I look and sound.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But again, my job is just to
move out as much as I can.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:84%
It feels maybe a
little bit like what

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:84%
you would feel like before you
fall asleep, where you're aware.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.850 align:middle line:90%
You're observing.

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But the active mind is
not yet at the forefront.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you channel, is
there a specific person you

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.180 align:middle line:90%
channel or entity?

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: No, I have
always kind of explored

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.160 align:middle line:90%
different realms.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, how do you
know a demon doesn't get you?

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Well, I guess
it would have to be,

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:09.460 align:middle line:84%
A, a pretty tricky
demon because I

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:84%
think I would be able
to feel essentially

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.258 align:middle line:84%
the difference from honing
in on my second nature.

00:34:15.258 --> 00:34:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, you might.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.514 align:middle line:90%
But somebody else may not be.

00:34:17.514 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, I definitely
don't recommend doing it at home

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:21.190 align:middle line:90%
and just going for it.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:25.210 align:middle line:84%
I did intuitive readings
for several years

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.130 align:middle line:90%
before I learned how to channel.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.489 align:middle line:84%
And I learned how to create
boundaries for myself.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:34.389 align:middle line:84%
And I teach people how
to create those as well

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and access channeling
or intuition

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.360 align:middle line:90%
from an empowered place.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does channeling
always work for you?

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah,
there's, I think, times

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.860 align:middle line:90%
which maybe it flows more.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.920 align:middle line:84%
It's really just a matter
of getting into the state

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.120 align:middle line:90%
and then opening.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I tend to have it come
through a lot quicker

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:01.457 align:middle line:90%
when I'm channel writing.

00:35:01.457 --> 00:35:03.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot like just
taking dictation.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Automatic writing?

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, and I type.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I had a belief that it was
like spiritual to write it.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But then I just was
like, this takes so long.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who's really giving
you the writing, the channel?

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So when-- yeah,
when I'm opening,

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking to connect with
a certain consciousness.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And just pages and
pages will come out.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's always very
beautiful and, unfortunately,

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.920 align:middle line:84%
not something that I
would be able to write.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you're going
to channel force today.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Do I ask that person
questions, that entity?

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.975 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or do you just spout?

00:35:36.975 --> 00:35:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: They will
probably give you

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.460 align:middle line:90%
a heads up when they're ready.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I am going to channel
a group of Arcturians.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:84%
They always speak in
the we form anyway.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And explain
the Arcturians.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: So I was
channeling the Pleiadians

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.230 align:middle line:90%
and the Lumerians.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was introduced to
the Arcturians through--

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's another
planetary system?

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yeah.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And just-- I guess
at the core of it,

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:84%
it's just an
energetic resonance.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm not very curious about
the specifics of things

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:14.800 align:middle line:84%
other than the messages
that they have to share.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But the first time I
connected with them,

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:23.940 align:middle line:84%
they were very polite and kind
of acquiesced to all my boundary

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.740 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt really good
connecting with them.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think last time I was
here, I channeled the Pleiadian.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.082 align:middle line:84%
So I thought we'd call
some other friends.

00:36:32.082 --> 00:36:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
let's do what you do.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:34.665 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: OK, cool.

00:36:34.665 --> 00:36:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:39.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to get yourself
into a certain mode?

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, it takes
me a moment and just really

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.413 align:middle line:90%
to get Bree out of the way.

00:36:45.413 --> 00:36:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, well, we're
going to keep this camera on you

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.782 align:middle line:90%
and just watch what you do.

00:36:49.782 --> 00:36:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Great, thank you.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:90%


00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.610 align:middle line:84%
We are in great
celebration for this union,

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:16.320 align:middle line:84%
not only this union of this
channel but this meeting

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and the meeting of hearts
that is taking place

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and that, in a sense, has
called this meeting forth, yes.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So it is within your
enquiries of what

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:40.860 align:middle line:84%
you call the metaphysical world,
your curiosities around what

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.950 align:middle line:90%
lies beyond the physical eye.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But it is also the great calling
of your hearts, yes, your desire

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.970 align:middle line:84%
to live embodied
from what many may

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:05.350 align:middle line:84%
call a heavenly-like existence
or awakening or transcendence.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:08.600 align:middle line:90%
So what we are saying is that--

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and there are many who have
created this very moment

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:84%
from the topics in which
you have discussed already

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:22.863 align:middle line:84%
around the calling
of your heart, yes.

00:38:22.863 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can I ask
you a question?

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yes?

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:27.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
Bree or some entity?

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Ah, this is
an excellent question,

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:35.980 align:middle line:84%
one we would pose on to you
of which she has discussed

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.020 align:middle line:84%
this great illusion
of separation,

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.170 align:middle line:84%
although we understand the
nature of your question.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:47.740 align:middle line:84%
We are a group in which
Bree is very familiar with.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But it is not a particular
future incarnation of her that

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.660 align:middle line:90%
exists in another dimension.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:03.220 align:middle line:84%
We could say family
or well known, yes.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who are you?

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: We
are as in what you

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:17.930 align:middle line:84%
call a group of vibrational
beings of which you are as well.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And you call our group
the Arcturians, yes.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And as you can
tell, we are trying

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:36.040 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve these structures
and names and linear structures.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And we are attempting to create,
in a sense, a more familiar

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.420 align:middle line:90%
energy between us, yes.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do you channel?

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: It is the very
same call or curiosity

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:01.270 align:middle line:90%
just as you have discussed.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:09.400 align:middle line:84%
When there is chaos, there is a
greater call or a greater desire

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.860 align:middle line:84%
for the higher awareness
and energy and potential

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.860 align:middle line:90%
to solve a problem, yes.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And so this calling from
humanity, we can say,

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:34.440 align:middle line:84%
is essentially created
our presence, yes.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So it is, we could say,
a collaboration of sorts.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:50.490 align:middle line:84%
It is a union, like all
things, with the intention

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:90%
of creating harmony.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you hopeful for
the future of planet Earth?

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Hmm, we
are not too concerned

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.530 align:middle line:90%
with the planet itself.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:09.114 align:middle line:90%


00:41:09.114 --> 00:41:17.150 align:middle line:84%
We will say that we have
the ability or the greater--

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:22.610 align:middle line:84%
we have a larger scope or
perspective of potentials, yes.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And we also-- with our ability
to see beyond the linear worlds

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:39.160 align:middle line:84%
or what many call the matrix in
which humanity sometimes gets

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:49.980 align:middle line:84%
a little stuck within, we are
mostly hopeful that each one

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.780 align:middle line:84%
chooses to resonate with
the essence of their heart--

00:41:54.780 --> 00:42:00.720 align:middle line:84%
not to save the planet or
save humanity but simply

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:04.980 align:middle line:84%
to resonate with
what is essentially

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.410 align:middle line:90%
the energy of creation, yes.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you
bring Bree back, please?

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MELANSON: Yes.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:15.180 align:middle line:90%


00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:16.785 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
they've been like--

00:42:16.785 --> 00:42:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that you, Bree?

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, they're
just-- the hand movements,

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I think they've been
doing that lately.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's so
that it distracts me.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
aware of what you're

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.360 align:middle line:84%
saying when they
communicate through you?

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MELANSON: Yeah, I'm
like watching it, I guess.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:40.260 align:middle line:84%
