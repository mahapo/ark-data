>>JIMMY CHURCH: Hey, everyone.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jimmy Church.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:84%
You've probably seen me on Into
the Vortex right here on Gaia.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:10%
And today, I'm
honored to be sitting

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:10%
in for George Noory on this
episode of Beyond Belief.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:10%
Today's guest is
Timothy Alberino.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.680 align:middle line:84%
He's an author, explorer,
investigator of UFOs

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:90%
and lost civilizations.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:84%
He's here to talk
about his expedition

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:84%
into the Peruvian Amazon,
where he investigated

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:84%
the chilling Face Peeler
encounters that shook

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:90%
local villagers to their core.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.837 align:middle line:90%
Timothy, welcome to the show.

00:00:50.837 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY ALBERINO:
Pleasure to be with you.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I just
got back from Peru.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I've been there three
times in the last year.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:90%
You lived there for a long time.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the culture,
because you see it everywhere,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.120 align:middle line:84%
you turn your head, and
you see something ancient,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:84%
you see something strange,
you see something amazing.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
But I feel there's a lost
civilization, possible ET

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:90%
connection to so much of Peru.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel the same way
with the culture there?

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: Peru is
the last best place

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:90%
to discover profound mysteries.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:84%
There's so much in that
country, in that land

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that is just waiting
to be uncovered in both

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:90%
the Andes and the Amazon.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.995 align:middle line:84%
It is a mystical land,
as you well know.

00:01:37.995 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
about it that once

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.428 align:middle line:84%
you get deeply ingrained
into the culture--

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
This is something that a lot of
people who are just tourists,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.178 align:middle line:90%
they just go to Machu Picchu.

00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:48.713 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
ingrain themselves

00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:90%
in the culture at all.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.155 align:middle line:84%
But once you get
hooked, you stay

00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
hooked for the
rest of your life.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just the mystique
of the Andes and the Amazon.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:84%
There's something
very unique, something

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:90%
very special about Peru.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: When you
talk to the locals

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and you get out there,
like you're saying, away

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.258 align:middle line:84%
from some of the
larger destinations,

00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
you can discuss ET and UFOs
very openly, can't you?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: Definitely.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Peruvians, again,
both in the Andes

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and in the Amazon,
many Peruvians

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:84%
have encountered the
phenomenon up close.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
In the Andes
mountains, if you talk

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:84%
to the villagers who
live in the Andes,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:84%
they've seen the craft
descend, land, and occupants

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
get out and interact with them
and then go back in the craft

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:90%
and take off.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
Amazon, the Amazon,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:84%
people don't
realize that there's

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.560 align:middle line:84%
heightened UFO activity,
for whatever reason,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
in the Peruvian and
Brazilian Amazon.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I have a
shaman as a tour guide

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:90%
that takes me around down there.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And last year, he comes
up to me, Timothy,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and he says, OK, me
and my shaman friends,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
we have this location
on this mountain.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take you there,
where we have encounters,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and the ships come down,
and we have conversations.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
He said it in this
matter of fact,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
straight faced way, that this
is just almost a way of life.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: Yes.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.540 align:middle line:90%
I've heard many similar stories.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
There's legends
in the Andes that

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
tell of an advanced
civilization inhabiting

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:90%
the interior of the mountains.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.200 align:middle line:90%
They call them the Viracochas.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.623 align:middle line:84%
And these guys allegedly fly
around, usually in saucers.

00:03:36.623 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
ones that I referenced

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:84%
earlier that sometimes land
and interact with the people.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the group
that ufologists

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:90%
might refer to as the Nordics.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because those encounters

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:84%
seem to be more benevolent,
friendly encounters,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
whereas the ones that happen
in the jungle, not so much.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:90%
There's been a lot of--

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:90%
let's put it in these terms.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of hostility
in the Amazon, in both Peru

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:90%
and in Brazil.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the famous
Colares Incident in Brazil.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's been incidents
like that that have happened

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.637 align:middle line:90%
in the Peruvian Amazon as well.

00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about one of them today.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what it is.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it
is about this place.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's something, as I said
earlier, something very unique,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:84%
especially in regard
to the UFO phenomenon.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, here's the
million dollar question.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking
about the Face Peelers.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But is there, for you,
one site that stands out,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
that shows us that
there must have

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:84%
been a high technology,
lost civilization,

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
maybe with ET contact
that came before?

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: That's
a great question.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I would say there's
a series of sites.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And these are the sites,
these are the famous sites

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.237 align:middle line:90%
that everyone goes and sees.

00:04:51.237 --> 00:04:56.945 align:middle line:84%
Saqsaywaman, which is in Cusco,
the foundations of Cusco.

00:04:56.945 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Ollantaytambo,
which has, I think,

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:84%
the most exquisite cyclopean
architecture on planet Earth.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the foundations
of Machu Picchu,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:90%
which are megalithic.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about the city
of Cusco, the city of Cusco

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:90%
is a megalithic city.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.820 align:middle line:84%
The foundations of that
city are megalithic.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the foundations
are actually green diorite,

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:90%
the foundations.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Very, very hard stone.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And what you see in
Cusco today, even when

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:84%
you walk through
the streets and you

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
see these exquisite
megalithic walls, right there

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:84%
off of the plaza, right there
off of the main plaza in Cusco,

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
those walls are sitting on
green diorite foundations.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:10%
There's a megalith
building civilization

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:10%
that was even older than the
one that built Saqsaywaman.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: So layer upon
layer of construction,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:90%
megalithic construction.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: And so I would
say that that area of Peru

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:84%
is, to me, evidence of
a lost civilization.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And I have a friend
named Andres Adasme,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:90%
who's an archeo-astronomer.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant guy.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
He's a colleague
of mine in Peru.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And he has-- based on the
alignments of the temples.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Because the temples
in the city of Cusco,

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:84%
all of the major temples and
palaces, the Inca temples

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and palaces, are arranged
in an X configuration

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:90%
in the city of Cusco.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.797 align:middle line:84%
And this configuration,
it's very complex.

00:06:23.797 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:90%
We won't get into it here.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But this configuration
mirrors a configuration that

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.128 align:middle line:90%
happens with the Milky Way.

00:06:29.128 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:84%
When you look at it at two
different times of the year,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
it creates an X over
the city of Cusco.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.580 align:middle line:84%
The temples are aligned
to this configuration.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:84%
It also has to do with
the winter solstice.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you do this
celestial alignment,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:90%
you can lock in the time.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a time marker of
when the city of Cusco

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:90%
was built or about when.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's 10,000 BC.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: 10,000 BC.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: And not only that.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.563 align:middle line:84%
At Ollantaytambo, you can do
the same thing up at the--

00:06:58.563 --> 00:07:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've been
to Ollantaytambo up

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:84%
at the Temple of the Sun on
the summit of Ollantaytambo.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a
timepiece there as well.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to see,
but when you actually

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.570 align:middle line:84%
get an outline of
it from up above--

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: You see the
outline from the top.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: You can see it.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It's an alignment
with the temple.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And it marks the sun on
certain times of the year.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
the calculations,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:90%
it goes back to circa 10,000 BC.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So give or take 1,000 years
but some time around 10,000 BC.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's pretty solid
evidence that the city of Cusco,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.830 align:middle line:84%
whoever built those megaliths,
they did it circa 10,000 BC.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Isn't it strange--

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, then again, it's not.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:84%
10,000 BC is the
number, isn't it?

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.820 align:middle line:84%
With so many different
cultures on every continent

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: It is.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the marker for
the, 10,500 BC or thereabouts,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:84%
for the Younger
Dryas impact episode.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
This cataclysm that
destroyed the megafauna,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:84%
annihilated the megafauna,
and brought the old world

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:90%
to utter ruin.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: It continues
through not only in Bolivia

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:84%
with Puma Punku and
the alignments there.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:90%
But just go around the world.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:90%
You have the Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
You have the creation
story in Edfu

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:90%
with Egypt and Gobekli Tepe.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything goes back--
the aging of the Sphinx.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.398 align:middle line:84%
Everything goes back to
10,500 BC, doesn't it?

00:08:24.398 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: That's right.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you talk
about Tiwanaku in Bolivia,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:90%
and you have--

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
So in Peru and Bolivia, you
have two distinct megalith,

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:90%
cyclopean techniques.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.610 align:middle line:84%
You have the polygonal,
the pillowed polygonal

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.720 align:middle line:90%
that's everywhere in Cusco.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
interlocking rectangular blocks

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle line:90%
of Tiwanaku.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And in Ollantaytambo, you have
both of those styles combined.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Yet the cultures
weren't connected allegedly.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: That tells you
that those cultures were

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.880 align:middle line:84%
in fact connected
in the distant past

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and that they were employing
both of those techniques

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
at Ollantaytambo.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:84%
A remarkable megalith building
civilization that disappeared

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:90%
from the face of the planet.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, we know that the
Inca didn't build Saqsaywaman.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
No matter what the archeologists
and tour guides tell you

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
in Peru, the Inca did
not build Saqsaywaman

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
because my colleague,
Anselm Pi Rambla,

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:84%
he conducted an
excavation at Saqsaywaman.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
He went down to the
base level of the wall

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:90%
of the megalithic complex.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And he only found exclusively
pre-Inca artifacts.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:84%
There were no Inca artifacts
at the base level of that wall.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Only pre-Inca artifacts.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Which means the
Inca found the wall.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:90%
They didn't build it.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: I have an archeologist
friend, and I asked him.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:84%
If you could dig anywhere in the
world, you've got the budget,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.410 align:middle line:90%
what would you do?

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, the parade
grounds at Saqsaywaman

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.697 align:middle line:90%
That's where I would go.

00:09:57.697 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: I would
have a different answer.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say directly in the
front of the Coricancha.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Oh, that too.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: Because
there's a whole--

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.428 align:middle line:90%
we don't have to get into it.

00:10:07.428 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's a whole saga
unfolding right now.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to open
the fabled Chinkana.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
This underground
tunnel that was--

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: And it's marked.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: It goes for a mile
from beneath the Coricancha

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.560 align:middle line:84%
to the galleries
beneath Saqsaywaman.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
We know that there are
galleries, caverns,

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:84%
some artificial, some
naturally occurring,

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
beneath that megalithic
complex of Saqsaywaman

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, when it comes to
contact and ET and sightings,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.400 align:middle line:84%
is it because of the
geographic location of Peru?

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:90%
What came first?

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
chicken or the egg.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Did ET find it historically
and has always been there,

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.682 align:middle line:84%
or is there something about
Peru that is drawing them in?

00:10:53.682 --> 00:10:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: That's
a good question.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the answer.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
But I know that it has to
do with the Andes mountains

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:90%
and the Amazon jungle.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.482 align:middle line:84%
Again, if you talk to the
ancient Andean communities,

00:11:04.482 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:84%
they'll tell you that there's an
advanced civilization inhabiting

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:84%
the interior of the
Andes mountains.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So like a subterranean, crypto
terrestrial civilization.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I suspect that there
might be bases in the Amazon,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.510 align:middle line:84%
or rather under the Amazon as
well, and different factions

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:90%
that are operating there.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.398 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Tell us
about the Face Peelers.

00:11:26.398 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
What's the story behind
it in the legend?

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: So the
Face Peeler legend,

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:84%
the Pelacara legend in Peru,
it goes back to about the mid

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:90%
'80s but not further than that.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It started sometime
early to mid '80s.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Face Peelers are
these mysterious people,

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
these individuals
who are in possession

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:84%
of advanced technology,
who from time to time,

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
will abduct villagers, abduct
members of these Indigenous

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:90%
communities and always at night.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, these
individuals who are abducted

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:84%
are later found in the river or
in the jungle with their face

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:84%
entirely removed or partially
removed, or in some cases,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.430 align:middle line:84%
their organs have
also been harvested.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's not depredation from
animals, where the flesh is just

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.892 align:middle line:90%
haphazardly torn from the face.

00:12:20.892 --> 00:12:21.692 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:21.692 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:90%
It's surgically removed.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:84%
It's very much like the cattle
mutilation situation, where

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
the parts of the face and
other parts of the body

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:90%
have been surgically removed.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now,
that's your research,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and you've been
looking into this.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.477 align:middle line:84%
But how do the
villagers look at this?

00:12:37.477 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: The villagers,
when you ask them

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:84%
who the Face Peelers are--
because I heard about this when

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I lived in the Peruvian
Amazon for 10 years.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I learned Spanish.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I learned the particular
dialect of Spanish

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:84%
called Charapa in
the Peruvian Amazon.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.635 align:middle line:84%
And when you interact with
the Indigenous communities

00:12:54.635 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and you ask them about the
Face Peelers phenomenon,

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.593 align:middle line:84%
they're going to tell
you one of two things.

00:12:58.593 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Either these are gringos who
are here to harvest organs

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:84%
or for sex trafficking
or something like that.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Or you'll hear them tell
you that these are aliens.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:90%
These are extraterrestrials.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
they're not all in unison

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
saying these are
gringos is because

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:84%
of the technological
aspect of the phenomenon.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Whoever these Face
Peelers are, they're

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.890 align:middle line:84%
deploying advanced technology,
clearly advanced technology.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.530 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about aerospace,
advanced aerospace vehicles.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So what we would
describe as UFOs.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Craft that move in
very distinctive ways

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.170 align:middle line:90%
that are non-conventional.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:90%
They don't produce any noise.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.110 align:middle line:90%
They can hover in place.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:84%
There's no visible propulsion
system, typical UFO type stuff.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is a fundamental part
of this Face Peeler phenomenon.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
these individuals

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
who are the abductors
we can call them

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.270 align:middle line:84%
or the assailants, who
also themselves are arrayed

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:90%
in technological armaments.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.745 align:middle line:84%
They have body armor, very
interesting body armor.

00:14:04.745 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have
stealth capabilities.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
They can fly or float
through the jungle.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it's precisely
these attributes

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that lead some of
the Indigenous people

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to believe that these
are extraterrestrials,

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.070 align:middle line:90%
that they're not humans.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, when this
story broke a few years ago,

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I immediately
reached out to you.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:90%
We've done shows in the past.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
you lived in Peru.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And I watched the
videos, and we're

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:84%
going to watch one
here in a second.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:84%
This story broke, and I
called you immediately.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And you had some
interesting insight on it.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But when the story broke,
you were investigating it,

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:90%
But how did you take it?

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.072 align:middle line:84%
Was this new news to you,
or were you expecting this?

00:14:52.072 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: As I said, I
had heard of the Face Peeler

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.970 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon when I lived in Peru.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But this-- we live in a
different era now, obviously.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:90%
This phenomenon isn't ongoing.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
It comes in waves, and
you can have a decade

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:90%
in between the last incident.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we're in a
world now where even

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.280 align:middle line:84%
the people who live in deep in
the Amazon have smartphones.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first time people
actually captured footage.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Now they didn't capture
footage of the assailants,

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.560 align:middle line:84%
but they captured
footage of the incidents

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.325 align:middle line:84%
where they're pursuing
the assailants.

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear the
gunshots going off

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:90%
in some of these videos.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.622 align:middle line:84%
And in some of the
videos, you can actually

00:15:29.622 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:90%
see UFOs and the victims.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And there was a period
of time, back in 2023,

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.595 align:middle line:84%
in the month of July
primarily, but July

00:15:42.595 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and then the
beginning of August,

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the first week of August,
where something very bizarre

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.700 align:middle line:84%
was happening in
the Peruvian Amazon,

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
specifically in the region of
Alto Nanay up near Iquitos,

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:90%
north of Iquitos.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
But also in other
parts of the Amazon,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.260 align:middle line:84%
like in Pucallpa, in
which people were actually

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:84%
being attacked by UFOs,
there was one incident where

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.792 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was a young man.

00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It was a couple of young men
who were walking in a village.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And a UFO projected
a light at them

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and began to lift
them off the ground.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And that incident caused a lot
of trepidation in the jungle.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But then there were
other incidents

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
in which there was a
group of college students

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
who were in the jungle
for some project,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and they had a collective
sighting of some luminous being

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
walking in the jungle, and
they took a picture of it.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of that was
surfacing at the same time.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
particular incident

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that happened in the village of
San Antonio de Pintuyacu, which

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.410 align:middle line:84%
is in the region of Alto Nanay
near the city of Iquitos,

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:49.070 align:middle line:84%
in which the villagers were
being assaulted for weeks,

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:90%
for a few weeks continually.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
every single night,

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:58.230 align:middle line:84%
but the assaults were happening
within this period of time

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
frequently, in which
these assailants,

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
who were dressed in
black armored body suits,

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
were making incursions into
the village, and in one case,

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
attempted to abduct a
15-year-old girl named Talia

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:16.563 align:middle line:84%
and apparently to attempted
to cut her face off.

00:17:16.563 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: We'll get to that.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:84%
We have the video of the
village and the shootout.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And as we look at this video, I
want you to walk us through it.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.860 align:middle line:90%
But the village is in fear.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
They're panicked, so much so
that the mayor and everybody

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
else did what they felt was
the only option, which was

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:90%
to shoot at these assailants.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at the video here.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.338 align:middle line:10%
>>ALBERINO: Compelling
videos began

00:17:46.338 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:10%
to surface on social
media, featuring

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.830 align:middle line:10%
an alleged alien attack in a
remote jungle village called

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:10%
San Antonio de Pintuyacu, which
is inhabited by the Indigenous

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:10%
Ikitu people and located
deep in the Alto Nanay

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:06.900 align:middle line:10%
region of the Peruvian
Amazon, northwest of Iquitos.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
The video depicted
an alarming scene

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
in which the men of the village
were in a state of panic,

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.620 align:middle line:84%
discharging their firearms into
the jungle in the dark of night.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:84%
According to the apu,
whose name is Jairo Ritguy,

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:84%
the assailants were
arrayed in peculiar body

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:90%
armor with elongated helmets.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.840 align:middle line:10%
They seem to be
impervious to gunfire

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:10%
as they were shot at point
blank range to no effect

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:10%
and could seemingly
disappear into the night.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: They were in fear.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: Yeah.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:90%
They were being terrorized.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, there were
some images that went around

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:53.300 align:middle line:84%
of what appeared to be a being
in the tree above the house,

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.155 align:middle line:84%
and I thought it
was very compelling.

00:18:55.155 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: That was in that
was in the city of Nauta.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So the video that
you guys just showed,

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that was San Antonio
de Pintuyacu.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And after that
incident happened,

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.190 align:middle line:84%
people were asking me to
go to Peru, to go to Peru

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and investigate, because
nobody was investigating.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And the villagers
were begging, they

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:84%
were begging the
government to protect them.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.278 align:middle line:84%
Begging specifically the
Navy to protect them.

00:19:22.278 --> 00:19:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were producing videos
where they were all holding up

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:84%
signs saying, we're under
assault, please help us,

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:90%
or something to that effect.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And the provincial
government was not

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:84%
responding because they weren't
taking the situation seriously.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
they dispatched--

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
because the villagers
were demanding

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
that they do something, they
dispatched two police officers

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:84%
with a Navy escort
to go to the village.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.477 align:middle line:84%
And these two police officers
investigated a particular

00:19:53.477 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:84%
incident that happened with
that 15-year-old girl that I

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.990 align:middle line:90%
mentioned earlier.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And these guys
concluded, absurdly,

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:08.380 align:middle line:84%
that what was happening was that
river miners were terrorizing

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:84%
the villagers to try and
drive them off their land,

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
so that they could conduct their
mining operations on the river,

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and that they were doing this
with state of the art jetpack

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Jetpacks.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.353 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: River
miners with jetpacks.

00:20:24.353 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now, these
aren't river miners

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.410 align:middle line:84%
with the mining company
and high tech equipment.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: No.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: These are mud-covered,
Indigenous people in the river,

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:90%
illegally mining.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: So the
press ran with this.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:90%
They ran with this story.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh, mystery solved.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Mystery solved.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just those pesky
river miners with jetpacks.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely absurd.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.390 align:middle line:84%
If you know anything
about the Amazon jungle

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and if you've ever encountered
the river miners, as I have,

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.520 align:middle line:84%
in the Amazon jungle, their
operation is very rudimentary.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
They float around on these,
what's called balsas.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:90%
These barges, rusted out barges.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.672 align:middle line:90%
And they dump mercury.

00:21:04.672 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very destructive
to the environment.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.005 align:middle line:84%
They dump mercury
into the river,

00:21:08.005 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and then they trudge the river,
and they try and separate

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:90%
the gold.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.372 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, it's illegal.

00:21:15.372 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So they'll have
shotguns with them.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But they certainly do not have
state of the art jetpacks.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.063 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Only a few people
on this planet have jetpacks.

00:21:25.063 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: And
the jet packs that

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
are available in the
commercial market,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.918 align:middle line:84%
you can't hardly stay
aloft for very long.

00:21:31.918 --> 00:21:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't stay
aloft for very long.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Or navigate
the jungle canopy.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: Or
navigate, exactly.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:90%
At night.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: At night.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: At night.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And then be
impervious to gunfire

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and be able to float
off the ground a meter.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
By the way, when
we investigated,

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:84%
we found out that they were not
flying around with jetpacks.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:90%
That was not true.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:84%
They were flying around
on circular platforms,

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and they were surfing
on the platforms.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:84%
They were not flying
around jetpacks.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.240 align:middle line:84%
They did have
hardened backpacks on,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:84%
which we hypothesize
that these are perhaps

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:84%
like fuel cells or some kind
of a reactor or battery pack.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:84%
But they did have
the capability, aside

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:84%
from the circular
platforms, to float.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So they had some
kind of mechanism

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:84%
built into their footwear
that allowed them to float.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And we were told by multiple
people in the village

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:84%
that they could jump
over houses, over trees,

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:90%
like leap over houses.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think that these
guys were wearing

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.920 align:middle line:90%
some sort of an exo suit.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Definitely body armor.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:84%
These helmets that
were like oblong.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And they had these
almond-shaped eye lenses

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that were described
variously as being

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:84%
tinted, yellow tinted or green
tinted, so like night vision.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.462 align:middle line:90%
And they were very tall.

00:22:53.462 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
The assailants were described as
being very tall, taller than me.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:57.253 align:middle line:90%
Everybody said they were--

00:22:57.253 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm 6-1, so I look like a
giant standing next to these

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Indigenous people.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But they all said that these
guys were taller than me,

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:90%
about a foot taller than me.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere in the
neighborhood of 7 to 7.5 feet.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Even some of them
would say up to 8 feet,

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:84%
but that could be
an exaggeration.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.925 align:middle line:84%
So these are very
strange assailants.

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And they would make the
incursion into the village.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The way it would
start, the villagers

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:84%
would see these little flying
mini flying saucers silently

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle line:90%
hovering above their village.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And what they were viewing
were the platforms.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And these guys would
be, they'd come two

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.370 align:middle line:90%
by two on the platforms.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.780 align:middle line:84%
They would go descend
into the jungle.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
surreptitiously

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:90%
enter the village.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:84%
They would sneak
into the village.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking
about one or two

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.650 align:middle line:90%
or three people who saw them.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
most of the village.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
There's about 200 inhabitants
in San Antonio de Pintuyacu.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.815 align:middle line:84%
Most of the village saw
these guys in some capacity.

00:23:49.815 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:84%
They either saw them
flying in the sky.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.240 align:middle line:84%
They saw them sneaking
into the village.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:90%
They saw them abducting--

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.680 align:middle line:84%
the attempted
abduction of Talia.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And many of the villagers
actually shot at them

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.790 align:middle line:90%
point blank range.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And they heard the
16 gauge shotguns.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.060 align:middle line:84%
They heard the BBs dinking off
of some kind of body armor.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it's absolutely
mind-boggling to me

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
that the Peruvian press
and the American press

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.690 align:middle line:90%
ran with a jetpack miner story.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolute absurdity.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:20.732 align:middle line:90%
Preposterous.

00:24:20.732 --> 00:24:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: All they
wanted was help.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:90%
They were asking for help--

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: And
they didn't get any.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:90%
And so then they left.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And the whole world thought
it was jetpack miners.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Nauta.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Nauta has a population,
I believe it's 36,000.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.740 align:middle line:84%
You're not dealing with
a small village anymore.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Nauta has a military base.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Nauta has a large
police presence.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:43.920 align:middle line:90%
They have helicopters.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.260 align:middle line:90%
They have boats.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:90%
They have Navy boats.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:90%
They have armaments in Nauta.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And the same phenomenon
was happening in Nauta.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So now, the jetpack narrative
is absolutely illogical.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this isn't--

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.370 align:middle line:84%
San Antonio de Pintuyacu
and the other villages

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that were being assaulted
are soft targets.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Nauta is a hard target.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.410 align:middle line:90%
This is a different environment.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And people who talked about
this, were talking about it

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.843 align:middle line:84%
at the time, were not
talking about Nauta.

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:84%
They were not
talking about Nauta.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Nauta and
investigated it as well.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.807 align:middle line:84%
And that's where that video
comes from that you mentioned.

00:25:17.807 --> 00:25:20.057 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Who did you take
with you on the expedition?

00:25:20.057 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: I took a friend
of mine named Doug Thornton.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And Doug, he was
an infantry Marine,

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.180 align:middle line:90%
and he also worked at the DHS.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know
what I was getting into

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and nobody had gone out
there to investigate.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.725 align:middle line:84%
And I did think
in the beginning,

00:25:36.725 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:84%
before I went out
to the village,

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:84%
that we could be
dealing with the cartel

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of drug
trafficking that goes up North.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.520 align:middle line:84%
By the way, San Antonio
de Pintuyacu an island

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of a vast,
uninhabited wilderness.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:52.530 align:middle line:84%
When you go North of San Antonio
de Pintuyacu, there's no people.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.745 align:middle line:90%
There's no villages.

00:25:53.745 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: This is a jungle.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: It's just Amazon.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Untracked Amazon jungle.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
provincial government

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:03.870 align:middle line:84%
established a communications
outpost there.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:84%
This is a very ancient
community, by the way.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
These are called
the Ikitu people.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:90%
And they're wonderful people.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Very old Indigenous community,
very important Indigenous

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:13.620 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And the government established
a communications outpost.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.530 align:middle line:84%
They built this
concrete building

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.370 align:middle line:84%
that the villagers
call the Tambo.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's got a tall radio tower
on it, and it has internet.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:90%
They have internet there.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So these villagers, they're
not like walking around

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.290 align:middle line:90%
in loin cloths.

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Some of the guys will
be sitting in the Tambo

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:84%
because it's free internet,
on their smartphones watching

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Marvel movies.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So these people, they
know what helicopters are.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:90%
They know what airplanes are.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.580 align:middle line:84%
They watch all the
same movies as we do.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.630 align:middle line:84%
They're very well educated
in San Antonio de Pintuyacu.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.333 align:middle line:84%
They're still very
Indigenous in regard

00:26:47.333 --> 00:26:49.750 align:middle line:84%
to their connection with their
roots and their traditions.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.820 align:middle line:90%
But they're modern people.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they were
able to capture the cell phone

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.190 align:middle line:84%
footage out there
because they have--

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:57.845 align:middle line:90%
and upload it from the village.

00:26:57.845 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So they could
capture the footage

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and then upload it because of
the communications outpost.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Now you're
there to investigate,

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:84%
but you're also a resource
for them too as well.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.830 align:middle line:90%
What did they ask you?

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Assistance, advice?

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: So people were
asking me, not from the village.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.700 align:middle line:84%
People who follow
me on social media

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.463 align:middle line:84%
are aware of the kind
of expeditions I do,

00:27:19.463 --> 00:27:21.880 align:middle line:84%
were begging me to go down
there because nobody was going.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So I tagged my
friend Doug because I

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.242 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to go alone because
I knew it could be dangerous.

00:27:26.242 --> 00:27:27.690 align:middle line:84%
We went in with
just GoPro cameras

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
because we did not want
to go in high profile.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.690 align:middle line:90%
We wanted to go in low profile.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I should say before I went, I
made contact with the village.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to my colleague,
Ronny Burnett,

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:90%
who's a Brazilian ufologist.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.570 align:middle line:84%
He got me in contact
with the village.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with Christian,
who captured the video.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Christian, he was this local
schoolteacher there, young man.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And Christian and I
began to interface.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And I recorded a
video on WhatsApp,

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and I recorded some audio
expressing my intentions,

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to come and
investigate the Face Peeler--

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenon that had
happened, the incident.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And they played it in their
elders council in the village.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And then in response to that, I
received an official invitation

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:84%
from the apu, the chief, and his
elders, to come to the village.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't just showed up on
the scene with cameras and stuff

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:23.390 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I actually had a
formal invitation.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the apu
met me in Iquitos,

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.500 align:middle line:90%
when I flew into Iquitos.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I chartered a riverboat
called La Esperanza.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And the apu accompanied
me from Iquitos

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.540 align:middle line:90%
on the riverboat to the village.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So we were escorted
into the village.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And we were informed
that, first of all,

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:84%
the villagers, the men in
the village, the villagers

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:48.570 align:middle line:90%
were traumatized.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Many of them had PTSD
from the incidents.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were not going
out into the jungle,

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.170 align:middle line:84%
to what's called their
chakras, their farms,

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:01.710 align:middle line:84%
to harvest their
products, their produce.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.253 align:middle line:84%
So they were running
low on supplies.

00:29:03.253 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:84%
They're running low
on medical supplies.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to help
them and to bring them

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.480 align:middle line:90%
some food and medical supplies.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank the
guys from Conduit Church.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:84%
They helped me
fund the operation.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we were able to resupply
them with food, medicine,

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Did they open
up because you were there

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:84%
helping them, they
were asking for help?

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And then were
there descriptions?

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Were they open about
what they were seeing,

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and was there
similarities in this?

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: There were no
conditions on the investigation.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I was welcomed to
come investigate.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:47.075 align:middle line:84%
But when you go into communities
in the Amazon to do anything,

00:29:47.075 --> 00:29:49.200 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to go into
an Indigenous community,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:84%
as a gringo, as a foreigner,
you always bring something.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:90%
You have to bring gifts.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the way they are.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.930 align:middle line:90%
They're very hospitable people.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why this was
appropriate for me to do it

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.050 align:middle line:84%
because I understand
the culture.

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.643 align:middle line:90%
You go and you bring something.

00:30:03.643 --> 00:30:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just a
little sack of rice,

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.250 align:middle line:84%
you always bring something
to the community.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Right.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to talk
about the Face Peelers

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.300 align:middle line:90%
unless you bring us.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.990 align:middle line:84%
What were their descriptions
of the Face Peelers like?

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: They described
them as being exceedingly tall,

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:84%
wearing armored
bodysuits, head to foot.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.320 align:middle line:84%
An oblong helmet,
elongated helmet.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.720 align:middle line:84%
With the almond-shaped
eye lenses.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: In the
image of in the tree,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.760 align:middle line:84%
it felt, and I don't
want to go Hollywood,

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.680 align:middle line:90%
but it felt predator-ish.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: Yes.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:90%
We went to that site in Nauta.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And in my video on YouTube,
we freeze the frame,

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like--
now, I don't know

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.520 align:middle line:84%
if it's just a play on
the lights or whatever.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.960 align:middle line:84%
But it looks like a
really big gray alien.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
the eye shine up.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: He's looking
right at the cam.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: And he looks over.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Now again, is this just.

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.280 align:middle line:84%
because of the way
that the flashlight

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.345 align:middle line:90%
is moving on the foliage?

00:31:04.345 --> 00:31:05.145 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:05.145 --> 00:31:07.562 align:middle line:84%
But when we went to that site,
I wanted to go to that site

00:31:07.562 --> 00:31:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and get an understanding of what
it looked like in the daytime,

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:14.230 align:middle line:90%
in daylight--

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: With the roof line
and the tree in the background.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.843 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: Exactly.

00:31:16.843 --> 00:31:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it appears in the
village that whatever this was

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.490 align:middle line:90%
was right above the house.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.510 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:84%
We realized when we got there
that it was behind the house,

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:90%
in this large tree.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.647 align:middle line:84%
And if that was a
being, then it's huge.

00:31:30.647 --> 00:31:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Then it was much
larger than when it appeared.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: 8 feet
tall, 9 feet tall.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.730 align:middle line:90%
It had to be really big.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.020 align:middle line:84%
The head had to
be about this big.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, there
were a couple of incidents.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And the lady across the street,
the neighbor across the street.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.080 align:middle line:90%
I played the video back for her.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And she hadn't seen that
particular incident,

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:84%
but she had seen
another incident there.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And in this other
incident, she saw

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.870 align:middle line:90%
a saucer hovering in that area.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Was this the acorn?

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: No.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.200 align:middle line:84%
This was the typical flying
saucer she drew in the sand.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.310 align:middle line:84%
It was a circle, and it had
like lights around the base.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And her other
neighbors all attested

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.810 align:middle line:84%
to seeing a flying
saucer hovering

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.580 align:middle line:84%
above this tree on a
different occasion.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Tim, we have the
image here of your freeze frame.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: Well,
I mean, this to me

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.550 align:middle line:90%
looks like a typical Grey alien.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.160 align:middle line:84%
You can see what
appears to be big,

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.280 align:middle line:84%
black, almond-shaped
eyes with the light

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:90%
shining off of those eyes.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.390 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm not sure if
this is an entity,

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:10%
or as I said before, maybe just
the way that the flashlight

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.190 align:middle line:10%
is shining off of the leaves.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:47.140 align:middle line:84%
However, I should say
that in the video,

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.580 align:middle line:84%
the residents of this
neighborhood are frantic.

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:90%
And they're yelling.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
looking up in the tree.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And this guy has a
flashlight, and he points it

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:58.940 align:middle line:90%
at whatever this is.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.220 align:middle line:10%
And he says, "ahí está,
ahí está." está, ahí está"

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.120 align:middle line:10%
There it is.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.080 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.530 align:middle line:90%
He seems to identify it.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.580 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, we could
be looking at an entity.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:90%
We could be.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying we are.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.955 align:middle line:84%
We could be looking
at an entity.

00:33:14.955 --> 00:33:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And here's where this gets
really interesting for me.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:23.050 align:middle line:84%
9 foot tall, maybe 10 foot tall,
Grey alien or mantis-type being.

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Insectalin as Dr.
Jacobs calls them.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:90%
The Vegas incident.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Very similar.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.725 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: The exact
same description.

00:33:31.725 --> 00:33:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Very similar.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.125 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: The same thing.

00:33:33.125 --> 00:33:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have in the Vegas
incident, which was,

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:90%
was that 2024?

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.420 align:middle line:84%
These incidents all-- there
was a cluster of incidents.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And you had the thing that
happened in the mall in Florida.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.670 align:middle line:84%
All these things
kind of happened

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.032 align:middle line:84%
within a window of like
six months or something.

00:33:46.032 --> 00:33:47.240 align:middle line:90%
They were not that separated.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Different
sides of the country,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.615 align:middle line:90%
different parts of the world.

00:33:49.615 --> 00:33:50.415 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: Yeah.

00:33:50.415 --> 00:33:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the Vegas incident,
you have the body cam

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:56.010 align:middle line:84%
from the officer who sees
this thing come down,

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:84%
clearly come down
in the neighborhood.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.473 align:middle line:84%
And then this family makes
that frantic 911 phone call.

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:03.390 align:middle line:90%
And what did they say?

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:07.370 align:middle line:84%
They saw these alien beings
that were what, 9, 10 foot tall

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:08.310 align:middle line:90%
in their backyard.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: You know what
was similar about each one

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:90%
of those cases?

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
frightening part.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:17.960 align:middle line:84%
The beings, the
entities, the creatures,

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.050 align:middle line:84%
acted like an apex
type predator,

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.150 align:middle line:84%
where they were not concerned
about being looked at.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.520 align:middle line:84%
They were not concerned
about being chased.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.590 align:middle line:90%
They were just OK.

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And they were observing
the situation.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ran.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:33.670 align:middle line:90%
Nobody took off.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:38.070 align:middle line:84%
It was an apex predator
just looking at something

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.635 align:middle line:90%
that it wasn't that concerned.

00:34:39.635 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: And that's a great
analogy because they clearly

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:90%
have cloaking technology.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.679 align:middle line:84%
And in the Vegas
incident, you'll

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:90%
recall that the news showed up.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:51.790 align:middle line:84%
The local news organization
showed up fairly quickly,

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:53.040 align:middle line:90%
I think the same night, right?

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.125 align:middle line:90%
They show up on scene.

00:34:55.125 --> 00:34:57.250 align:middle line:84%
They don't have permission
to film in the backyard,

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.292 align:middle line:90%
so they cut their camera.

00:34:58.292 --> 00:35:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they're following
the family into the backyard.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And in the backyard, they have
like some forklifts and stuff.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And they said that the
aliens, when they saw them,

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.260 align:middle line:84%
were ducking behind
the forklifts.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And the camera follows them
into the backyard, and it cuts.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But before it cuts,
it captures something.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.410 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen clips of this.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people focus on
something behind the fence,

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:90%
and I've seen those too.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
to make of those.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.612 align:middle line:84%
People, different things
about that fence, right?

00:35:23.612 --> 00:35:25.240 align:middle line:90%
That's compelling.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you look beyond
the fence and you

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.910 align:middle line:84%
look behind the forklift,
where they were talking about,

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:84%
there seems to be precisely the
same size and shape head that's

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.080 align:middle line:90%
in the tree in Nauta.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's doing the same thing.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of looking.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:41.108 align:middle line:90%
It kind of looks like--

00:35:41.108 --> 00:35:42.363 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Just nonchalantly.

00:35:42.363 --> 00:35:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: Just nonchalantly,
looks over like this.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And it gives me chills
even talking about it

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.560 align:middle line:84%
because it looks like
the identical same thing

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.210 align:middle line:84%
in the tree at Nauta
and behind the forklift.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Not feeling
threatened, not scared,

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.470 align:middle line:90%
not concerned.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Apex predator type of
interaction, where they were not

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.898 align:middle line:90%
frightened by humans.

00:36:02.898 --> 00:36:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: That's right.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: And that's a pretty
chilling thought, isn't it?

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: It is.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
with this situation

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that was unfolding in
San Antonio de Pintuyacu

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and in the Peruvian
Amazon in general, what's

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.070 align:middle line:84%
really bizarre about
this is that there was

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:84%
a joint operation that
coincided with these sightings

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.540 align:middle line:90%
in the Amazon.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was an operation led by
the United States government.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:28.873 align:middle line:84%
And it was called
Resolute Sentinel.

00:36:28.873 --> 00:36:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Interesting
name for that operation.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:31.485 align:middle line:90%
>>ALBERINO: Resolute sentinel.

00:36:31.485 --> 00:36:32.285 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Right.

00:36:32.285 --> 00:36:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: And there were
eight different nations.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.840 align:middle line:90%
It was based in Peru.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.840 align:middle line:84%
The operation was based
in Peru, but it involved

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.670 align:middle line:90%
the Peruvian Armed Forces.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Brazil, Uruguay, Ecuador.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I think Colombia.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:84%
A bunch of South
American countries.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And the United Kingdom.

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.640 align:middle line:90%
And we had the Marines.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.170 align:middle line:90%
We had the Air Force.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:55.250 align:middle line:90%
We had the Navy.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.240 align:middle line:90%
We had the Coast Guard.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.622 align:middle line:90%
We had Space Force.

00:36:57.622 --> 00:36:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: That's right.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: And some other
branches of our military

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.050 align:middle line:84%
that were involved
in this operation.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So when you say
predator, I think

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.113 align:middle line:84%
it's possible that
we were aware,

00:37:07.113 --> 00:37:08.530 align:middle line:84%
some element of
our government was

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:12.070 align:middle line:84%
aware of a very nefarious
group that was operating

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:14.115 align:middle line:84%
in the Peruvian
Amazon and that we

00:37:14.115 --> 00:37:16.240 align:middle line:84%
sent in perhaps some special
ops teams or something

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.990 align:middle line:84%
to monitor, to surveil, or even
perhaps to confront whatever

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:21.320 align:middle line:90%
was happening out there.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And we used Resolute
Sentinel as a cover.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.180 align:middle line:90%
That's just a conspiracy theory.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Well, it would
make sense because,

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.710 align:middle line:84%
well, to protect
what was going on,

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:84%
but to stop something
that could be running

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.560 align:middle line:90%
around not of this planet.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:84%
We have the situation
where what appear

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:45.290 align:middle line:84%
to be the Face Peelers
attempting to abduct Talia

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.100 align:middle line:90%
that you mentioned earlier.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.235 align:middle line:90%
What happened with that?

00:37:49.235 --> 00:37:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: We went to
the village one evening.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.533 align:middle line:84%
And during the evening, in
these Indigenous communities,

00:37:53.533 --> 00:37:55.400 align:middle line:84%
all of the people
are in the square.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:90%
And the men are playing soccer.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.800 align:middle line:84%
The women are
playing volleyball.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.270 align:middle line:90%
And they're having a good time.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.943 align:middle line:84%
We were just sort
of walking around,

00:38:01.943 --> 00:38:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's
having a good time.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And we spotted this young girl,
this teenage girl sitting up

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.735 align:middle line:84%
against the wall all by
herself, up against the Hut.

00:38:08.735 --> 00:38:10.610 align:middle line:84%
She's got a smile on
her face, and she's just

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.810 align:middle line:84%
watching everyone else
play soccer and volleyball.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to
the Apu, and I told him

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.030 align:middle line:90%
I would like to interview Talia.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, there
she is right there.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.280 align:middle line:90%
That's her.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.388 align:middle line:84%
It was this young girl
sitting up against the wall

00:38:22.388 --> 00:38:23.430 align:middle line:90%
with a smile on her face.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:90%
She looks over.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.897 align:middle line:84%
She happens to look
over at me and Doug.

00:38:25.897 --> 00:38:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And me and Doug are
imposing figures.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:28.890 align:middle line:90%
We're big gringos.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as she sees
us, as soon as she sees us,

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:84%
she freezes, and she
starts to tremble.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.340 align:middle line:90%
And she looks down.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:90%
She's trembling.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And she takes her hair, and she
covers that side of her face,

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.010 align:middle line:90%
like blocking her face from us.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And she's just trembling.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Obviously severe PTSD.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.228 align:middle line:84%
Her father went
and talked to her.

00:38:49.228 --> 00:38:50.520 align:middle line:90%
She did not want to talk to us.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.140 align:middle line:84%
She was associating us
with her assailants.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.627 align:middle line:84%
Well, fast forward
the next morning, I

00:38:57.627 --> 00:38:59.210 align:middle line:84%
went over to her
house, and her father

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:00.720 align:middle line:90%
convinced her to talk to me.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And she told me the
story of what happened.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And she was trembling and
crying for some of it.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And she told me that one day
in the afternoon, right before

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.040 align:middle line:90%
sunset.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And these incursions
only happened after dark.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.090 align:middle line:84%
She had a stick in
her backyard, and she

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.090 align:middle line:84%
was trying to knock down
some fruit from a tree.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:19.320 align:middle line:90%
The fruit fell to the ground.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.890 align:middle line:84%
She bent over to pick it up,
and she felt a wind at her back.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And the dry leaves were
being rustled on the floor.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And she looked up,
and she saw that there

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:34.230 align:middle line:84%
was this individual dressed in
black, in black armored body

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:84%
suit, surfing on a hoverboard,
surfing on a circular platform.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.080 align:middle line:84%
He came up right next to her,
and he dropped behind her.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And he grabbed her from
behind, and he put his hand

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.110 align:middle line:90%
over her mouth.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Then another guy came up, and
there was like a gully behind,

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.212 align:middle line:84%
forested gully, jungle
behind her house.

00:39:49.212 --> 00:39:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is in the
middle of the village.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.920 align:middle line:84%
This isn't even on the
outskirts of the village.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And this other guy comes
up in the same way,

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:56.310 align:middle line:90%
surfing on this platform.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Lands in front of her
and grabs her feet.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:01.590 align:middle line:84%
They press something
on their boots.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.940 align:middle line:90%
That lifts the platforms up.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they carry her behind
like this thatched roof chicken

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:08.580 align:middle line:90%
coop.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.210 align:middle line:90%
And they land.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I won't go through all
the details for brevity's sake.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.407 align:middle line:84%
They shot something up her
nose with a nasal syringe.

00:40:16.407 --> 00:40:17.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing they did.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.282 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
that, she started--

00:40:19.282 --> 00:40:20.710 align:middle line:90%
It was like a sedative.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And she was getting
disoriented a little bit.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they smeared
this cream on her face.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And she heard them
speak in Spanish.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.530 align:middle line:84%
One she calls the
gringo because she

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.140 align:middle line:84%
says he had a gringo
accent like me, she said.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And the other one said just
sounded like a Peruvian.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And she said that the
gringo guy was smearing

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:42.140 align:middle line:84%
this cream on her face, and
the Peruvian Face Peeler

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.070 align:middle line:90%
said, be careful, be careful.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Don't put too much on.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.590 align:middle line:90%
You're going to ruin the flesh.

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: OK.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:50.840 align:middle line:90%
We have a video here of Talia.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Take us through this, Tim.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The girl, whose
name is Talia,

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:58.070 align:middle line:84%
was able to scream during the
altercation with her assailants

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and was fortunately rescued by
her brother and her neighbors,

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.950 align:middle line:84%
who came running to
investigate the commotion.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Talia sustained a
laceration in her neck

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and was in a state
of chemically induced

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.240 align:middle line:84%
disorientation for some
time after the incident.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: After they smeared
this cream on her face,

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.478 align:middle line:84%
they took out what appeared
to be like a laser syringe.

00:41:19.478 --> 00:41:22.020 align:middle line:84%
The way she described it, it
was like a little laser syringe,

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.478 align:middle line:84%
and they started
to cut, and that's

00:41:23.478 --> 00:41:26.250 align:middle line:84%
what you see in the video, the
incisions beneath her neck.

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And as they began to cut,
she started to struggle,

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and she got her hand up
underneath because the guy was

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.480 align:middle line:84%
behind her with his
hand over his mouth.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.770 align:middle line:84%
She got her hand up
underneath his helmet

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and started to push
up on his helmet.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't want
her to see his face.

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So he scrambled to
pull his helmet down.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.290 align:middle line:84%
They dropped her momentarily,
and she screamed.

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And when she screamed,
the villagers

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.490 align:middle line:84%
were already in a
state of vigilance.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:54.450 align:middle line:84%
They came running on the scene
and with their flashlights,

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and they saw these assailants
floating on their disks,

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.020 align:middle line:84%
floating on their
circular platforms,

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and Talia laying on the
ground, bloodied up.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
saw her assailants,

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and then they took Talia to
a medical post in the village

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.020 align:middle line:90%
down the river.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CHURCH: Is this ongoing.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ALBERINO: It was happening for
a few months from early July,

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:24.120 align:middle line:84%
basically the summer of 2023,
basically in the summer.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Most of the activity
was in July.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.800 align:middle line:84%
It is no longer
happening in the Amazon.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm in communication
with the village.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.550 align:middle line:84%
They have had no
further incidents.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.392 align:middle line:84%
We armed them with technology
to film, to aid in their patrols

00:42:36.392 --> 00:42:37.350 align:middle line:90%
that they were running.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.990 align:middle line:90%
We gave them walkie talkies.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:43.370 align:middle line:84%
We gave them all kinds of
technological equipment.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.750 align:middle line:90%
And the phenomenon has ceased.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:48.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not been happening.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CHURCH: Such a compelling
and frightening story.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:53.690 align:middle line:84%
