00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:10%
We've got a very special guest
for you, award-winning author

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.800 align:middle line:10%
Sonja Grace, a highly sought
after mystic healer and artist

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:10%
with both Norwegian and
Native American heritage.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.890 align:middle line:84%
As an energy surgeon
and remote healer,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.130 align:middle line:84%
she has been counseling an
international roster of clients

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.450 align:middle line:90%
for more than 30 years.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Sonja, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.805 align:middle line:84%
>>SONJA GRACE:
Thank you, George.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:48.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a healer?

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, there's
lots of kinds of healers.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.840 align:middle line:84%
You can go to your massage
therapist and get healing.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:10%
You can go to an energy
healer and get healing.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:10%
You can go to all kinds
of different modalities--

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:10%
acupuncturists, naturopaths.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.120 align:middle line:10%
The kind of healing that
I do is long distance.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to wherever
the person is, wherever

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:10%
they are in the world,
and I'm able to put myself

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:10%
in front of them
and work on them as

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:10%
if they were right there.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So I go in and repair
hearts, and tissue,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:90%
and livers, and spleens.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:90%
I work on cancers.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I work on blood,
bones, everything.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
where the ailment is

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:90%
or do they tell you?

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Oh, they tell me.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.340 align:middle line:90%
They tell me.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And the more information
I have, the better it

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:84%
is, because if someone's
dealing with a type of cancer

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:84%
let's say, and
they've had a scan,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
they've already had
all the tests done,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:84%
then I know exactly
where I'm honing in.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I see things that
they haven't had scanned

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm able to
identify that as well.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.333 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of a concert.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
You're also what we
consider a spirit traveler.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.530 align:middle line:84%
In all the work that I
do, George, every day,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
you know going to
where people are--

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:90%
I'll have a client in Australia.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll have
a client in Sweden

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll have
a client in LA,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
wherever, I'm literally
spirit traveling every day.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
I go into meditation.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And in meditation,
my body dissolves.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It just becomes like
little particles

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:90%
of sand floating away.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm going to explore
a site, like a sacred site,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
my guides come to
me and they take me.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And I literally travel
with them back in time.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And we discover
what happened, who

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:84%
built the site,
why it was built.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's an amazing experience.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And every time I do
this and I time travel,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:84%
when I come back I'm
a bit discombobulated.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean I really know I've been
somewhere because it takes

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.152 align:middle line:90%
me a long time to come back.

00:03:03.152 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have a new
book with a card system

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:90%
called "Odin and Nine Realms."

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:90%
And who is Odin?

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Odin is the Norse
god who most people are maybe

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:84%
familiar with through the
"Thor" movies and "The Vikings"

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and various shows
that have been out.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:84%
This book is a very
comprehensive display

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:90%
of Norse mythology.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's also my interpretation
of the Norse gods, their magic,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:90%
the ruins, and the nine realms.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's all built
in a 54 card oracle

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:90%
that I did all the artwork for.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have a little
video to display this.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: My name is Sonja Grace.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I am a mystic and healer
with both Norwegian

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:90%
and Native American heritage.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.760 align:middle line:84%
In my spirit travels, I have
visited Stoplesteinan and Hunn

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Gravfelt stone, both ancient
stone circles in Norway

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:84%
where the Norse gods
gave me instructions

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:90%
to create an oracle.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:84%
We traveled through
the nine realms

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.475 align:middle line:84%
where I met the Norns, fire
giants, elves, dwarves,

00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:23.275 align:middle line:90%
and the gods.

00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I created the artwork
for each of the 54 cards.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote the words
spoken to me by the gods.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.800 align:middle line:10%
Odin, Thor, Baldur, Loki,
Freyja, Frigg, and Ran

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:10%
all share messages of love,
fear, purpose, power, medicine,

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:10%
and energy, revealing
new insights

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:10%
into the human experience.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:84%
In this oracle, the ruins
reveal powerful messages.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:10%
The magic of Norse
mythology are the elements

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:10%
that guide even the gods.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:10%
Deepen your connection to spirit
and follow your life's path

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:10%
with the ancient wisdom of this
powerful divination tool called

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.145 align:middle line:10%
"Odin and the Nine Realms."

00:05:15.145 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in a little
bit of "Beyond Belief,"

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pick
several of these cards.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And Sonja is going to tell
me a little bit about myself.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.390 align:middle line:84%
They're a little like
tarot cards, aren't they?

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.975 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: They are.

00:05:28.975 --> 00:05:29.775 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:90%
It's an oracle.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:90%
You can use it in any way.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.260 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
different cards spreads

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:90%
that I gave in the book.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:90%
You can also just pick a card.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Ask a question.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Pick a card.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you key
in on Norse mythology?

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: You know, I grew
up in Portland, Oregon.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And my dad's parents
and my father all

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle line:84%
came from Norway so a lot of
the influence in my childhood

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:84%
was hearing Norwegian and
everybody eating Norwegian food

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:84%
So it really, obviously,
shaped my life as well as

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.390 align:middle line:90%
my Native American heritage.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And I decided it was a
really great opportunity

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:90%
to connect with Norse mythology.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.870 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, George,
the Norse gods came to me

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:90%
and asked me to do this oracle.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh really?

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how did
they come to you?

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: When I traveled,
I spirit traveled first

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
to a stone circle
called Castlerigg.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:90%
That's in the UK.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I went there physically
and in my spirit travels,

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I saw Bifrost, the bridge
between Mitgard and Asgard.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.225 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the Norse gods coming
through the stone circle.

00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: So when all of this was
taking place, it was 10,000 BC.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was the beginning
of a new phase of humanity.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:84%
All these portals opened
up all over the earth.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And the gods started coming
through, the demigods.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that a good thing?

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.503 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, because
they're the ones that

00:07:08.503 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:90%
helped shape humanity.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian gods
shaped those people.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.717 align:middle line:90%
The Norse gods shaped the--

00:07:14.717 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Greeks.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.760 align:middle line:84%
The Greek gods, the Mayan
gods, the Hopi gods.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So all of these demigods
came through to Earth.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And the Norse gods came
through Castlerigg.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered
that the Pleiadians, who

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.570 align:middle line:90%
are also demigods, were there.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So they went from
Castlerigg over

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
to Stoplesteinan, which is a
stone circle there in Norway.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And they shaped the people
there in Scandinavia.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
When I say shaped, I mean
they taught them ceremonies.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:90%
They crosspollinated with them.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.255 align:middle line:84%
They basically helped
recreate people.

00:07:54.255 --> 00:07:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now these
stone circles,

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.080 align:middle line:84%
like Stoplesteinan in
Norway, what are they for?

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: They're portals.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.270 align:middle line:90%
They're all portals.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:90%
That's like Castlerigg.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are there ley lines?

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, there are ley
lines that run through there.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
But these are
portals that energy

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:84%
is either coming up from
Earth or coming down

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:middle line:90%
from the heavens or both.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.727 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they leading us to
other dimensions or something?

00:08:17.727 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way that
the gods come through.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It's how they travel
here to Earth.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:90%
They use these portals.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why Stonehenge
is not only marked

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:84%
by these giant sarsen stones
but the whole area of Salisbury

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:34.765 align:middle line:90%
Plain is a giant portal.

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Now what are the nine realms?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.200 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: The nine realms
are like nine dimensions.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:90%
They're worlds.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And each
world does what?

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They're all held
within the tree of life,

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:90%
which is called Yggdrasil.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life is at the
center of the universe.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So these nine worlds exist
all at the same time.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And they represent all
kinds of things-- the elves,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
the dwarfs, the Vanir,
which are the gods

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:90%
and goddesses of fertility.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:90%
There's Asgard, Midgard.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:84%
There's all nine
realms holding each

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.720 align:middle line:84%
of these elements
that are visited

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:90%
throughout Norse mythology.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can humans go
through these portals?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I did.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do that.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I did.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do it
spiritually, I assume, right?

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.660 align:middle line:90%
In my spirit travels.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And I did spirit travel to Hun,
which is where these nine stone

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:90%
circles are in Norway.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was spectacular.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The Norse gods took me
through the nine realms

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and showed me what
each one was about.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
you can't get back?

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I'll call you.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Call me up coast to coast.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I'll call you on Coast.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:90%
No, I--

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean
can you get trapped

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:90%
in these other dimensions?

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.430 align:middle line:84%
When I went to
the realm of hell,

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:84%
which is not hell as we
think of it in Christianity.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
It's more of where
everybody goes

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and the goddess Hell
governs that realm.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:84%
There was a there was a witch,
a shaman-like witch named Groya

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:90%
who--

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Male?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Female?

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Female.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Who would not remove this piece
of shard from Thor's head.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:90%
And he had asked her to do it.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:90%
She didn't do it.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
He was still looking for
her to have this done.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And anyways, I encountered
her in the realm of hell.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:90%
And they tried to keep me there.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:90%
And Odin--

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They capture you?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.770 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to keep me there.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And Odin and the Norse gods,
basically, got me out of there.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:90%
And I mean fast.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.228 align:middle line:90%
We were like gone.

00:10:55.228 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared?

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now are you
there spiritually?

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.395 align:middle line:90%
Or you're not there physically.

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I was
there spiritually.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But then my husband and I, we
just got back three days ago

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:90%
from Norway.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And we went to Hun.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And I stood in each one of
those nine stone circles.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:90%
It totally blew my mind.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:84%
It was exactly
what I experienced

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:90%
in my spirit trials.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There were apparently
giants on this planet

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:90%
a long, long time ago.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Does these conditions
tie into giants at all?

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:84%
One of the nine
realms, Jotunheimr,

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:90%
is the realm of the giants.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And these giants,
that realm sort of

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:84%
is right next to the realm of
Midgard, which is where we are.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And the giants would often
mess with the people.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And also the gods
had a relationship

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:84%
with them, sometimes a very
close relationship with them.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And there were people
born out of the giants.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
These giants were definitely
from elsewhere in the universe.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And all of my study
and research on giants

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:84%
is tied to Jotunheimr
and the realm of giants.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I went into
that realm, they

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:84%
told me that they had
a particular portal

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
within the realm that they would
travel to where they're from.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing the parallels of
what we know today about giants

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and what I've learned
from this realm of giants.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.085 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go
through these cards.

00:12:38.085 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And you want me just
to select a few?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Sure.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'll do one at a time.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Sure.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.172 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
we'll hold it up so

00:12:44.172 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:90%
people can see what it is.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Now where I pick the
card or what card I pick

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.787 align:middle line:90%
is entirely up to me.

00:12:51.787 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
have to do with fate?

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It does.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I pick this
card over that card,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Well, it's your energy.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.567 align:middle line:90%
Your energy is directing you--

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something is
directing me to this--

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: To what message
you need to hear.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.458 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like I looked at this
but I don't want to take it.

00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to take this one.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:90%
So I'll take this right here.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: OK.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And this one is what?

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Jera.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jera.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.080 align:middle line:90%
What does Jera mean?

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.670 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: It means harvest.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:10%
It's the natural cycle.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:10%
And it basically means, George,
that you have planted the seeds

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:10%
and now come to the
fruition of your harvest.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you're
working on, whatever

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
projects that you want to see
happen, you're at that point

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:84%
now where they will
come to fruition.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a really good card.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if I did
not pick this card?

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.648 align:middle line:90%
Something else?

00:13:42.648 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, then you would
have picked another card.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And we would have looked
at some other aspect.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But this card in particular
for you and the fact that I do

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:84%
know you is you've got
some kind of project that's

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:90%
going to come to fruition.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it fate
that gave me this card?

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It's your energy.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.085 align:middle line:84%
It's your energy and
the fate of the gods.

00:14:05.085 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's do one more.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:90%
Interesting cards.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:90%
I'll take this one.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:90%
This is a strange one.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.700 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: This is Bjarkan.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bjarkan.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Interesting graphic, too.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, this card
is about fertility again.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fertility?

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Woo hoo.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:10%
And this card
basically is about you

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:42.720 align:middle line:10%
taking your life very seriously
and not taking it for granted.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:10%
This is about you having
the gifts that you

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.710 align:middle line:10%
have in your world and really
honoring them and holding

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:10%
them near and dear to you.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So some of these cards
basically reinforce things

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that I'm doing in
my life right now.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.375 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:14:59.375 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And they're
good messages for people

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:90%
to have some guidance.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes we just
have a gnawing question.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to get that job?

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to be
able to have a child?

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to be able to meet
that person that I've always

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:90%
wanted to meet?

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a way of guiding people.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And George, I'm booked out
six months ahead of time

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:90%
with appointments.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So this was my way of giving
this to my clients and people

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
who are interested in having
some guidance when they

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.205 align:middle line:90%
can't reach me on the phone.

00:15:35.205 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does this
mythology work, Sonja,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:90%
when a child is born?

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.095 align:middle line:84%
Does a shaman come by and
bless the kid or what happens?

00:15:43.095 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: In the tree
of life, Yggdrassil,

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:90%
there are three main roots.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And under one of the routes are
these women called the Norns.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Norns?

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: The Norns.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:54.663 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spell that.

00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: N-o-r-n-s.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Norns.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:90%
And they are quite magical.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.207 align:middle line:84%
They determine the
fate of a child.

00:16:03.207 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they shamans?

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: They are like shamans.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But they're actually more
powerful than even the shamans.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.992 align:middle line:84%
And they determine the past,
present, and future of a child.

00:16:13.992 --> 00:16:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they the Volvas?

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The Volvas are
the women shamans.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.610 align:middle line:90%
They're the female shamans.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And they practice a magic
that's called Seidr.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Seidr?

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Seidr.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And Odin is trained
in Seidr as well.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Odin and all the gods
would go to the Volvas

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:90%
and ask them for their guidance.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Volvas were
the wives of the men

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.990 align:middle line:84%
who battled on the field,
the shaman warrior men.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many of these
people, these individuals

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:53.340 align:middle line:84%
like this, would be in a tribe,
for example, in those days?

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean would there be
hundreds of them, just one?

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:90%
How many?

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: There would
probably be, I would say,

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of people, because
even though the world was

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:08.280 align:middle line:10%
a much smaller place
back then, there

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:10%
was quite a few
times in our history

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:10%
where I think the population was
much higher than we know even

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.460 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going
basically on what we find.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.942 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of things
that haven't been dug up.

00:17:22.942 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So for
people who pick up

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
your book of "Odin and the
Nine Realms," what do you want

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:90%
them to take away from that?

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you want them to learn?

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, it's extremely
educational in Norse

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:90%
mythology for one.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And for two, it's
a way for people

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:84%
to find those answers that
they're looking for from a very

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:90%
spiritual context.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, Odin hung from the
tree Yggdrassil, the tree

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:90%
of life, for nine days.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds me so much of
the Lakota Sioux in that they

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.233 align:middle line:84%
hang from the tree in a sun
dance ceremony for four days.

00:18:01.233 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now what do you mean he
hung from a tree for nine days?

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: He hung from
a tree for nine days

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
to sacrifice himself to receive
more information, whatever

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:90%
he was looking for.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he tied up?

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.010 align:middle line:90%
He was tied.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tied up to
a tree for nine days.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Nine days.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he received
the 24 runes, the runes being

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:23.950 align:middle line:90%
the cards that you picked.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
They were spiritual
messages that he was then

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:90%
able to share with the people.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who
brought them to him?

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They were manifested
through his connection

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:84%
as a demigod and
the tree of life.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So Odin, and Thor, and Loki, all
of them used to take human form

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.517 align:middle line:90%
and walk amongst the people.

00:18:47.517 --> 00:18:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I
remember an old movie

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:84%
when I was a kid with Kirk
Douglas called "The Vikings."

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there
was a lady there.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I guess she would be
called one of these Volvas.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And she was
screaming with bones.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:90%
She had bones.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:90%
And she'd throw the bones.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And whatever the way they
landed, she would read them.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But I remember specifically
her yelling Odin, Odin.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:90%
So was he like a god?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:90%
He was the main god.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:90%
He is the main god.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And I really want
to preface that they

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
are so ready to come
back and help the people.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And I find it really
interesting when I'm in Norway,

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I look for signs
of them, meaning

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:84%
gift shops and
some of the things

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.570 align:middle line:84%
that people would
sell in their stores.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that's
about Norse mythology?

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
that you'll find

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.820 align:middle line:84%
are little trinkets of Thor's
hammer like a necklace.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: That's it.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.490 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're really
not practicing Norse mythology

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:47.211 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:19:47.211 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, the
country is wiped clean

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.630 align:middle line:84%
of anything that has to
do with Norse mythology.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Because it
was so Christianized.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
story of Ragnarok--

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: --is when
the Norse gods fell,

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and there's a big battle,
and some of them died.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe Ragnarok happened
because Christianity came in,

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and it was a way of
ending the paganism that

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:90%
was being practiced.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Are you unhappy that it's
not continuing anymore?

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, I'm happy
that they came to me

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:30.245 align:middle line:90%
and asked me to bring them back.

00:20:30.245 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
When I went into Stoplesteinane
in the stone circle there,

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.525 align:middle line:90%
I opened that portal.

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it like Stonehenge?

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It's smaller.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.255 align:middle line:90%
But it is, it's a large circle.

00:20:40.255 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Same
techniques, though?

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Same principles?

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, and I
opened that portal,

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and Freya, another
Norse god, came to me

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and thanked me and said,
you opened this portal.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And we can't thank
you enough, because we

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:84%
want to come back
and help the people.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that about all
the gods, all the demi-gods.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian gods,
they've never left.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:84%
They've actually
always been here.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Mayan gods, the
Hopi gods, the Greek gods,

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.360 align:middle line:90%
they're all coming back in.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And now, today, because
we're in the fifth dimension,

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:84%
we have all these
portals opening.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of stuff
coming through to Earth now.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't these
gods all the same,

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:84%
they just represent
different things?

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, I see
them being different.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I see them having
their own social structure

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.100 align:middle line:90%
that we, humans, have.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're friends
with people in Japan,

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and we're friends with
people in Australia.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like we have
these social structures

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:90%
to our world.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.170 align:middle line:84%
They, too, have a
social structure

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
in how they know each other and
how they relate to each other.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are the
ravens, Huginn and Muninn?

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: These
are Odin's ravens.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Odin has two Ravens that
sit on his shoulders,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and they go through
all the nine realms.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And they are his eyes and
ears, and they report back

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.075 align:middle line:84%
to him what is going
on in all nine realms.

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:07.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Norse mythology,
which is really not

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.372 align:middle line:90%
being practiced anymore?

00:22:12.372 --> 00:22:14.455 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I think
there are people out there.

00:22:14.455 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
disappointing to you?

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.508 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, there
are people out there

00:22:17.508 --> 00:22:21.770 align:middle line:84%
who are very much into this,
but it's not mainstream at all.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing that people are
finding readily in some store.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Of course, now,
they'll find Odin.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, they'll find
that, Odin and the Nine Realms

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Oracle.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.512 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Now, they'll find
this and go, oh, cool,

00:22:32.512 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Norse mythology.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But it really has
gone underground.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And when we were in Norway, we
visited the Viking Ship Museum,

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and these huge ships
are in this museum.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:90%
It's so cool, George.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:84%
They're ornate and carved and
beautiful, beautiful wood.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And these ships
carried the dead.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.363 align:middle line:84%
They would bury their
fallen Viking warrior.

00:22:54.363 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they were a warring
group, too, weren't they?

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean they had warrior
shamans and things like that.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They did, and
these warrior shamans

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:90%
were also practicing Seidr.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And what they would do is they
would wear their animal totem,

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.990 align:middle line:84%
like the skin of a wolf
or the skin of a bear,

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and they would transform
on the battlefield.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And when they transformed,
it was called going berserk.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And they would go
berserk and they

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:84%
would win, because they
were very powerful shamans.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And the Valkyrie, who
were the women that

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
take the men who fall on the
battlefield, to Odin's hall

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:90%
called Valhalla.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.065 align:middle line:90%
The Valkyrie were their wives.

00:23:38.065 --> 00:23:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Valhalla was
like heaven, wasn't it?

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yes, yes, it
was a big, great hall

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that Odin had, where the
fallen warriors would go.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you study all this?

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Where do you go to study this?

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I
read a lot of books.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I studied a lot of books.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.580 align:middle line:90%
I did a lot of research, yes.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are ancient runes?

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Runes are
the magical messaging

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.827 align:middle line:90%
pieces that Odin received.

00:24:08.827 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they like dominoes?

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.950 align:middle line:90%
What do they look like?

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Dominoes.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.860 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] No, they're more
like stones, and they've got

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:90%
a symbol carved into them.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So these stones that had
the rune on it, the message,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.200 align:middle line:84%
is what Odin received when he
hung from the tree, Yggdrasil.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And they became the
messaging system

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.770 align:middle line:84%
that the volva, the shamans,
and all the people would use.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they do
everything through these runes?

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I think they
were very much like a tool

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that, in today's world, maybe
someone would use a pendulum

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and douse.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, they used the
ruins in the same way.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your artwork in the
book, Odin and the Nine Realms

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:90%
is very different.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Who came up with that?

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: They're all my designs.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:90%
It's my work.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.587 align:middle line:84%
I've been an artist since
I was a little kid, yeah.

00:25:00.587 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, you
know I saw the gods.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I saw all these things,
George, in my spirit travels,

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I created all
of these particular pictures,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:90%
because this is how I saw them.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So I depicted exactly what
I saw in my spirit travels.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.698 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do these gods
want to come back, Sonja?

00:25:23.698 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Because we are--

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Through you?

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: We are coming to the
end of a phase of humanity,

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:36.980 align:middle line:84%
as I said to you, in, when we
spoke about Spirit Traveler,

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:90%
10,000 BC, Atlantis had fallen.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:90%
Lemuria had fell.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Comets had hit the
Earth, 12,800 BC.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:50.420 align:middle line:84%
10,000 BC, Ice Age is
starting to recede.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.730 align:middle line:84%
All these portals have opened
up all over the planet.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
The demi-gods are
coming through.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.930 align:middle line:90%
People are coming in.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're now coming to the
end of that phase of humanity.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So we are getting
ready, as people,

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.980 align:middle line:84%
to pass the baton to the babies
that are being born today,

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.790 align:middle line:84%
because they're star seeds,
just like we were when we first

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.910 align:middle line:84%
came through at the end
of Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.238 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
practice this every day?

00:26:19.238 --> 00:26:20.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you wake
up in the morning

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.242 align:middle line:90%
and you do shamanistic rituals?

00:26:24.242 --> 00:26:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I
have coffee first.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.420 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And then, of
course, because I'm

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:84%
with clients all day
long on the phone,

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I go into meditation
before I begin, yeah.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonja, Ragnarok-- tell
us a little bit about that.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.510 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Ragnarok was considered
the end of Norse mythology.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the gods actually
perished in Ragnarok,

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:90%
which isn't true at all.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I believe Ragnarok
was the creation

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:84%
of the first Christian
priests and people

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:84%
who were leading the people
into Christianity to end Norse

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.713 align:middle line:90%
mythology, to end paganism.

00:27:07.713 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To do away with it?

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: To do away
with it, yeah, sure.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's have a grand
finale of the Norse gods.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's put an end
to it, so everybody

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.900 align:middle line:90%
can move into Christianity.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I think Ragnarok marks
times in our history

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.180 align:middle line:90%
where things have ended.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
The fall of Rome, the end of the
Third World in Hopi mythology--

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:84%
there's things that get
marked by these big moments.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And this ended, to me,
when Christianity began.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there anyone
in North mythology

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:90%
still practicing this?

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not counting you, but
are they doing this anymore,

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.315 align:middle line:90%
or is it gone?

00:27:49.315 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I think
there are people

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:84%
who are practicing Norse ways
and paganism in this way.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I think there's lots of people,
but it's not highly publicized.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- like,
there's a lot of people

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:84%
who follow Sekhmet,
the goddess from Egypt,

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.050 align:middle line:90%
but it's not highly publicized.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this going to
get better or worse for most

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:17.220 align:middle line:84%
people, in terms of the
knowledge of things like this?

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I think it's
going to get better.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm an optimist, George.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.770 align:middle line:90%
I think that even though--

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your whole life
has been an optimist.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:25.387 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, it has.

00:28:25.387 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Even though that we're coming
to the end of this phase

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, it doesn't mean
that we're all going to perish

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.820 align:middle line:90%
or the world's going to end.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.220 align:middle line:84%
It means that we're
going to transform.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.790 align:middle line:84%
It means that our
responsibility and what

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.630 align:middle line:84%
we pass on to our
grandchildren is so important.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It's so, so valuable
to them and what

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.130 align:middle line:84%
they'll build for this
next phase of humanity,

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I can't stress it
enough to people.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you went to
Norway today and started

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:84%
talking about this to
the citizens of Norway,

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.650 align:middle line:90%
would they understand this?

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I think some of
them would understand,

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.750 align:middle line:90%
but they're very superstitious.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.070 align:middle line:90%
It was really interesting.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Even my sister--

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Superstitious
or suspicious?

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Superstitious.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.148 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
there's a difference.

00:29:12.148 --> 00:29:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: My sister, who
is a doctor in Norway,

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
first thing she asked me when
she saw the deck-- is there

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.110 align:middle line:90%
a Loki card?

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that mean?

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, Loki is one of
the gods, but he's a trickster.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:28.560 align:middle line:84%
He's a very mischievous
kind of guy.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a devil?

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, but he's a giant.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And even though he's a giant,
he was accepted by the gods.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people in Norway
are very scared of Loki.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.090 align:middle line:84%
They see him as being
someone who's going

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:90%
to make trouble in your life.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So I told her, yes,
there is a Loki card.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I read her what the
Loki card says in the book.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:56.280 align:middle line:84%
That he really is
about transformation.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.560 align:middle line:84%
He is a trickster,
but the same way

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that the coyote is a
trickster, the same way

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:90%
that raven is a trickster.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you say
is the most satisfying aspect

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:06.810 align:middle line:90%
of what you do?

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.262 align:middle line:90%


00:30:09.262 --> 00:30:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Now you're
going to make me cry.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
important thing for me

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is hearing from people
how much I help them,

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.240 align:middle line:90%
how much they feel better.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The feedback
they give you?

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:24.823 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: They feel better.

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:27.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
not ill anymore.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.772 align:middle line:90%
They're they were bleeding.

00:30:28.772 --> 00:30:29.980 align:middle line:90%
They're not bleeding anymore.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, whatever it is,
whatever I've worked on

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.090 align:middle line:90%
or helped them with, that--

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.602 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- there is nothing
that compares to that.

00:30:38.602 --> 00:30:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Makes you
feel good, doesn't it?

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.189 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, it makes me cry.

00:30:42.189 --> 00:30:43.772 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are
emotional about this.

00:30:43.772 --> 00:30:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I am.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been the one
case you've done in your life,

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:51.760 align:middle line:84%
your career, that
you'll never forget?

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, there's a lot
of those, George, but I think--

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.880 align:middle line:84%
I think there's so many stories
of people that I've helped.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of the best ones
have been a woman

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:84%
who told me how much I changed
her life when I worked with her

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and helped her
get through a very

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:90%
difficult time with her family.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And a man just called
me the other day.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.280 align:middle line:84%
He was having blood in his
urine, and I worked on him,

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.617 align:middle line:90%
and it was gone.

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, they still
do conventional medicine,

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Of course, of course.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.046 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't tell
them, don't go to your doctor

00:31:30.046 --> 00:31:30.310 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Oh, no.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm the first one to
say, go get a CAT scan.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Go get an MRI.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.417 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go get
tests, absolutely.

00:31:36.417 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that's important.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: But you know, I had a
client of mine call me in LA.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.237 align:middle line:90%
His wife called me.

00:31:42.237 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It was time for his appointment.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And she said, he's
had a heart attack.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.230 align:middle line:84%
They're taking him into
surgery in two hours.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.810 align:middle line:84%
He asked that you
work on him first.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:53.650 align:middle line:90%
I went in.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I found blockage
in his arteries.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.620 align:middle line:90%
I cleaned it out.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I took out a bunch of stuff
that was blocking the arteries.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
doing this mentally?

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I'm doing this with
my hands, because I'm in--

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you're not there?

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:10.210 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: No, but I am there in
the way that I work on people.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.920 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm taking
all this stuff out.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.270 align:middle line:10%
Cleaned him all out.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.400 align:middle line:10%
They took him into
surgery, opened him up.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's fine.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They said, we
can't find anything.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Closed him up.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Closed him back up.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.430 align:middle line:90%
They opened him up for nothing.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yep, and he wrote--
he wrote me an email.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, I love
you, Sonja Grace.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is Norse
mythology so important to you?

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Because I had
such a profound experience

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.510 align:middle line:84%
having the Norse gods come
walking out of Stoplesteinane

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and showing themselves to me,
seeing all of their clothing

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:45.820 align:middle line:90%
and costuming.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was just--

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.240 align:middle line:90%
they were so interesting.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was beautiful to
have them speak to me

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:57.393 align:middle line:84%
and ask me to present
them to the world

00:32:57.393 --> 00:32:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonja, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Thank you, George.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:02.597 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: One of the great
wonders of "Beyond Belief"

00:33:02.597 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:10%
is we learn things about it.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.850 align:middle line:10%
And Norse mythology is
something that I didn't really

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.080 align:middle line:10%
know that much about.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:90%
I do now.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
