to be emotional.

>>MONNA: It can be.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it definitely--
it can be if you don't

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.060 align:middle line:90%
know how to separate from it.

this psychic ability

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:90%
occur for you, Patricia?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:90%
At what point?

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:10%
>>MONNA: Well, my thing
is I didn't know that--

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:10%
I thought my reality was
the same as everyone else's.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:10%
It's not like I see dead people
walking through walls all

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:10%
the time or hear disembodied
voices in my head,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:10%
so I really have no idea
that you guys-- or, I guess,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:10%
the average person--

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:10%
couldn't see what I saw.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.830 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Because--

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You thought you were
part of everybody, right?

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yeah.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.575 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, when
it's your reality,

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
you don't really realize
that it's any different.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And even when discussing psychic
awareness and everything,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:84%
people who don't
understand the ability

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
think that it is
literally seeing

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:84%
things walking through walls
and voices and all this.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's not for me-- or
for me, anyways, it's not.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.010 align:middle line:84%
It's unknowing, and
it plays out for me.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.385 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were raised pretty
religiously, weren't you?

00:01:58.385 --> 00:01:59.185 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yes.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did that
conflict with this?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Very much so.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
My parents, they were very
huge born-again Christians.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we would be on our knees
praying before bed at night.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, they kept saying, try
to pray it away, pray it away.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.892 align:middle line:84%
But you can't pray away
your gifts, nor your angels.

00:02:17.892 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, you can't.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: No.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it
bother you as a kid?

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.212 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: I could feel.

00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But like I said,
I couldn't see it.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I would know things about
people just by looking at them

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:90%
or even touching their hands.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, I didn't know
that it was a different reality

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:90%
than anyone else's.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you talk to
your friends about this?

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yes, growing up.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my friends
knew about this stuff.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And I would-- even as a child,
I had this uncanny ability

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
to be able to sense death and
sense illness in a person.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
actually what brought me

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
to nursing because I was
a palliative oncology

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:90%
nurse for 13 years.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which deals with
late-stage cancer victims.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yes.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Absolutely.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, hospice work.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's got to
be pretty emotional.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: It is.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:90%
You get pretty attached.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
You literally love
them to death.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.587 align:middle line:90%
You have to show them peace.

00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:10.920 align:middle line:90%
You have to be able to provide--

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
what your job is--

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: --that comfort.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to just provide
them end-stage life?

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: Well, it was
nursing, but with that comes

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:84%
deathbed confessions
and regrets.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah, you hear it all.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.773 align:middle line:84%
And you get pretty attached
to certain patients

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:90%
that stand out to you.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Angela Thomas
is a psychic, as well.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And I talked with her about
these psychic abilities.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch her.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:84%
I really believe, Angela,
that people are clairvoyant,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:90%
that people--

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ANGELA THOMAS: Absolutely.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --have
psychic abilities,

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:10%
people are intuitive.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this has happened
to me time and time again.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:84%
I would not say that
I'm a psychic "psychic,"

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:84%
but there have been times
that I'll send someone a text

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:90%
message out of the blue--

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:90%
hey, are you OK today--

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
somebody I may not
have even communicated

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:90%
with for a month or two.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Right.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.807 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And out
of the blue, they

00:04:02.807 --> 00:04:05.680 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, my god, dot,
dot, dot, dot just

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:90%
happened to me or this or that.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.690 align:middle line:90%
I think that's intuitiveness.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that is a little
bit of being a psychic.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Well, it is, George.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:10%
You're absolutely correct.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:10%
When I teach
psychic development,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:10%
I let those people know
everyone is psychic.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:10%
Everyone has the ability to
give some sort of message

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:10%
or, like you, had perfect timing
in sending that text message.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:10%
The thing is is that not
everyone believes that they are

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:10%
and nor is that everyone's path.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:10%
They don't have a
passion to pursue,

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:10%
how do I develop my abilities
so that I can help others?

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.358 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't Angela look
like the actress Kathy Bates?

00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yes, she totally does.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:90%
And she is 100% correct.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is psychic.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:84%
We're all just at
different varying degrees.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe that it's a
spiritual path that leads one

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.270 align:middle line:84%
down kind of the
rabbit hole to discover

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:90%
how deep their abilities go.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
you have this ability?

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.725 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: I love it now because--

00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Now.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Now.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That means before--

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Oh, it's--

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --you didn't?

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.613 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Absolutely.

00:05:08.613 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:84%
It scared the heck
out of me as a kid.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Both of my parents were
deep into Christianity.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.995 align:middle line:84%
And so when I couldn't
understand something,

00:05:15.995 --> 00:05:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't understand what I
was feeling, they would say,

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's demonic.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Pray it away.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Pray it away.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.168 align:middle line:84%
And you can't pray
away your abilities.

00:05:23.168 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it wasn't demonic?

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: No.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:84%
It was, I was scared
of everything,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:90%
even when rushes of--

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
especially when rushes
of energy came at me

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't understand.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Or now I understand, once
we die, we are not dead.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:90%
We do--

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
convinced of that?

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: --cross to other side.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I know it.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:84%
I know it, or else I
wouldn't have a job.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing with
legitimate psychics.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.145 align:middle line:90%
People know their life, George.

00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: They do.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't BS someone
on their life.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.960 align:middle line:90%
They know it.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And the stuff that
comes out or that I see

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.820 align:middle line:90%
are very particulars.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:84%
With the gift of
remote viewing, it's--

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
you see everything the way
it's played out, right?

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So you get the little,
tiny details that I guess--

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.925 align:middle line:84%
A good psychic gets
the little detail.

00:06:14.925 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
tell me, Patricia,

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
how you work with
law enforcement.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:90%
How did that all start for you?

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: Well,
back in 2008, I got

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:84%
involved with a group of law
enforcement called Find Me.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're out of
Phoenix, Arizona.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And they are active and
retired law enforcement.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
There is linguistics
specialists,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
handwriting specialists,
body language experts,

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and 115 different
psychics that work

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
remotely all over the world
on missing person cases.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
All the work that
I do, everything

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.240 align:middle line:84%
that I do with missing
person cases, is volunteer.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:90%
I never get paid.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
willingly accept you,

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
or did they
reluctantly accept you?

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: It was
background checks.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I had to do cases that
were already solved,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:90%
but I knew nothing about.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So a picture of someone that
they know what happened,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:90%
and I've got to describe.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And then they match
and see how accurate.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.443 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How successful were you
finding these missing people?

00:07:17.443 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: Well, I found
28 missing people.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 28?

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: 28.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.897 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How many were alive?

00:07:22.897 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: One, the very
first person I found.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: That's it, yeah.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:27.168 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The others?

00:07:27.168 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: All passed away.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Murdered, everything?

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: Everything from
kidnapping to murder

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:84%
to suicide to just
wanting to disappear

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:90%
and then they take their life.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different circumstances.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And with the gift of remote
viewing or psychic work,

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:90%
you can see both sides.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
You can see it from
the victim's side,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and you can also see it
from the perpetrator's side

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.985 align:middle line:84%
if it is a murder, because
everything is consciousness,

00:07:52.985 --> 00:07:53.785 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:53.785 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: That's what
we are at our core.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So my job is to be able to
merge with the consciousness

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:84%
that I need to look
through in order

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
to provide the accurate details
of what happened to the victim.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.168 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you ever
looked at as a suspect?

00:08:08.168 --> 00:08:09.085 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Never, never.

00:08:09.085 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
danger for a psychic.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Well--

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because you
know things that only

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:90%
the killer and the cops know.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: Yes, but that's why
the majority of my casework

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
is all with the
police and Find Me.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't take very
many family cases.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So even with Brittany, who
we're going to be speaking to,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:84%
that was a very rare
opportunity for her

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:84%
to get information from me
because normally I say no.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Unless it's a police officer
asking me in on a case,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm too bombarded with cases
right now to take more.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.305 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, tell us a
little bit about this case

00:08:51.305 --> 00:08:52.960 align:middle line:84%
we're going to deal
with with Brittany.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:90%
And how did it come to you?

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Did law enforcement come to you?

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:90%
And what was the issue here?

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: Well, normally, law
enforcement does come to me.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle line:84%
But with Brittany, it was
very unusual circumstances.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.088 align:middle line:84%
So she came to me about
a year ago, I guess.

00:09:10.088 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She came to you first?

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: She came for a reading.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And she never said anything
about her father missing.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to know anything.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.230 align:middle line:84%
When a person sits in front
of me, I hold their hands.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:90%
I tune in.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- it's like a movie
that plays out in my head.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't want
to be led by the person?

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: No, no.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.825 align:middle line:84%
And if someone--
a lot of the time,

00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I keep my eyes closed
so that no one thinks

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading body language
or anything like that.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:90%
It is purely energy.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very, very sensitive
person to vibrations.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll put it this way.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
If someone was standing
in front of me,

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and they were lying to
me, you know about poof--

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: --adrenaline that
goes off when someone's not

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:90%
speaking their truth?

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:84%
It literally goes through
my body, and I feel it.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well--

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: So I'm very sensitive.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --we have set
up Brittany by Skype.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:90%
She is in Canada right now.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to
go to her and talk

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
with her about this incredible
case of her missing father.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.058 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yeah.

00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Brittany,
thank you for joining us

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:84%
via this incredible
technology of Skype.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.060 align:middle line:84%
You're in Canada, and it's
great to have you with us.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.975 align:middle line:84%
Tell us how you
approached Patricia.

00:10:17.975 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:10%
>>BRITTANY SCHNEIDER:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:10%
So I approached Patricia
through, actually,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:10%
a mutual friend who
had a reading with her

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:10%
and said it was incredible.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why I did
was because I had recently

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.070 align:middle line:10%
found out my dad was missing.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:10%
We were very close growing up.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:10%
But within the last four
or five years of my life,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:10%
we didn't speak very
much just due to--

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:10%
he was going through
a lot mentally,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.248 align:middle line:10%
and there are
challenges with that.

00:10:43.248 --> 00:10:45.840 align:middle line:10%
So we did-- our relationship
did suffer a little bit.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:10%
But I did reach out
to her, we will say,

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.020 align:middle line:10%
October 2019, I believe.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:10%
I found out my dad was
missing April, 2019, as well.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:10%
So I'd approached her
not really wanting--

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:10%
with the intention of
wanting to hear from my dad,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:10%
but more so just
about me and my life.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:10%
And if my dad came up,
then that would just

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:10%
be maybe a bonus and also sad.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.250 align:middle line:10%
So it was kind of
a weird situation.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:10%
So I had my reading
with Patricia.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:10%
And right away, she said there
was a male here in that moment.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:10%
And I was encouraged
to bring pictures.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:10%
And I did bring two.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.070 align:middle line:10%
I actually had lost my
stepfather, as well.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:10%
So I brought a picture
of him, kind of thinking,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:10%
oh, it's probably him that
came through, secretly hoping

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:10%
that it wasn't my dad dad.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:10%
Because if that was him, then
that would mean he had passed.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:10%
And I showed her a
picture of my stepdad.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:10%
And right away, she was
like, no, it's not him.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:10%
Did you bring in
another picture?

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:10%
And I did.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.410 align:middle line:10%
And I was hesitant, and I
showed her a picture of my dad.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:10%
And she was like, yes, this is--

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.220 align:middle line:10%
absolutely, he was
here right now.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.890 align:middle line:10%
And that's kind of
where it started.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And Patricia, when Brittany
came to you, is that unusual?

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.623 align:middle line:84%
Do people come to
you that way or not?

00:12:05.623 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Well, no, no.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I do do private readings
in my studio in Calgary.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I had assumed-- she had
booked a regular appointment,

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.312 align:middle line:84%
so I just assumed that
it was about her life,

00:12:17.312 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:84%
but I never know what's going
to come through in a reading.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then what did
you feel, psychically,

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.380 align:middle line:84%
to be able to tell her, your
father's coming through here?

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: Well, with
remote viewing,

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:90%
I get an image of who it is.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So her stepfather
and her father,

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.310 align:middle line:90%
they're different skin colors.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: They're
different ethnicities.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
knew that because it

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
was a Caucasian male that was
coming through to say sorry.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And Brittany, once she
started to tell you

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
she has connected with
your natural father,

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.770 align:middle line:90%
what did you pick up?

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:90%
What did you find out?

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHNEIDER: It was obviously
a very, very emotional

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.450 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:10%
I was visibly upset, but just
this weird sense of peace also.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:10%
I kind of had the
feeling when I found out

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:10%
he was missing that he
wasn't here on Earth anymore.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:10%
That's just what
I felt deep down.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:10%
And although I
didn't want to hear

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:10%
from him because that
had meant he had passed,

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:10%
I just kind of knew.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:10%
So right away,
yeah, she had said

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.330 align:middle line:10%
that he was very remorseful
and just very sad

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.300 align:middle line:10%
and saying, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, just repetitively.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:10%
And then I was obviously
upset, like I said.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:10%
And then we started to speak
about where his body was.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:10%
So it wasn't like a--

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:10%
he wasn't sick or anything.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.350 align:middle line:10%
He didn't pass away
from natural causes.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:10%
He wasn't at home.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.983 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't like that.

00:13:47.983 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:10%
So he had actually
left his home.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:10%
And she was able to say where
he was, where he left from.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.240 align:middle line:10%
So I can get specific.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.720 align:middle line:10%
So she said that it was--

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:10%
that he had left his home.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.500 align:middle line:10%
His body right now is--

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.540 align:middle line:10%
actually, before
I even get there,

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:10%
she did mention that
it was a suicide,

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:10%
and which is what I felt too.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:10%
And his close
friends had mentioned

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.080 align:middle line:10%
that he had been struggling
for a very long time,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.040 align:middle line:10%
and I had known that.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:10%
Being so close to
him, I did know that,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.840 align:middle line:10%
and it's what I felt when
I heard he was missing.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:10%
So she did say that.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, so she said
he had left his home.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:10%
He went to a wooded area.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:10%
It's very beautiful,
north of Vancouver.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:10%
He's outside.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.920 align:middle line:10%
There's a beautiful
stream nearby.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:10%
And then she had also
said that we weren't

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:10%
going to find him right away.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:10%
So he had went
missing April, 2019,

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.140 align:middle line:10%
and I had this
reading in October.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:10%
And she had-- she
said that we are not

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.970 align:middle line:10%
going to find him until
approximately a year

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:10%
after he's been missing.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.990 align:middle line:10%
So that is what I
took of the reading.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't go there to start
a search party for my father.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.368 align:middle line:10%
It was more for my
own peace and to see

00:14:59.368 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:10%
if he would come through.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.702 align:middle line:10%
And then we were talking
about other things in my life.

00:15:02.702 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:10%
So it definitely wasn't
a reading to immediately

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:10%
go, OK, where is he?

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:10%
We need to go now.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:10%
That's not what
it was, but I just

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:10%
considered it a
blessing that she

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:10%
was able to give me
peace in that sense

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.040 align:middle line:10%
and say where he was.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Initially,
when you approached

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:10%
Patricia, you didn't think
your father was dead, did you?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.305 align:middle line:10%


00:15:24.305 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHNEIDER: I didn't.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:10%
I went back and forth.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:10%
I had known he was
struggling mentally.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:10%
And when I first found
out he was missing--

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.845 align:middle line:10%
we hadn't had contact
for four or five years,

00:15:33.845 --> 00:15:36.530 align:middle line:10%
so I didn't know much
about his situation.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:10%
I did know he was living in
BC, but I didn't know much more

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:10%
than that.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:10%
I had in a sense already kind of
mourned that relationship just

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:10%
for my own heart.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.560 align:middle line:10%
It had been something like that.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.928 align:middle line:10%
But, yeah, I didn't go--

00:15:51.928 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You had a hunch?

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:10%
You had a hunch, though,
that something was wrong?

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHNEIDER: I did.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:10%
I did.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:10%
But I-- when I initially
went to go see her,

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:10%
I truly had no idea what
was going to happen.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.828 align:middle line:10%
I went for-- just to see my--
to talk about my life path,

00:16:04.828 --> 00:16:06.620 align:middle line:10%
and maybe my stepfather
would come through.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.400 align:middle line:10%
And then I was very nervous
if my father did come through,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.133 align:middle line:10%
if that were to
happen, and it did.

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
Patricia, how did you

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:84%
sense then that something
had happened to her father?

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.020 align:middle line:90%
He came through to you?

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Mm-hmm.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he tell you
he committed suicide?

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:21.325 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yes, he did.

00:16:21.325 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he kept having
me repeat, I'm so sorry,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do you
convey that to Brittany?

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Do me one favor.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yes.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because if
Brittany just came to you,

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're about to tell her
what her father has told you,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.940 align:middle line:90%
kind of recreate this for me.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:90%
Tell her.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Wow.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, he says he's sorry
that there was absolutely

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:90%
no way he could stick around.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:10%
His depression, the anxiety--

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:10%
he had a lot.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.590 align:middle line:10%
And he was-- your dad was
a bit of a loner, too,

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:10%
where he didn't--

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.360 align:middle line:10%
he would never have gone
and reached out for help.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
He was one that I've
got to do it on my own.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I've got to figure it out.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:90%
He didn't rely on others.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.360 align:middle line:10%
It almost felt like
him against the world.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.850 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:10%
When someone from the other side
explains it like that to me.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:10%
I understand the depth of that
kind of depression and anxiety.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.720 align:middle line:10%
And all I know is that he's--

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:10%
the amount of peace that
I see around him now,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:10%
he needed to come
through to give her

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.713 align:middle line:10%
the peace that she
was looking for

00:17:35.713 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:10%
so that it would be closure,
because his death had nothing

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:10%
to do with her.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was she
like emotionally when she

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.950 align:middle line:90%
came to you?

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: It was a
while ago, George.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So when a person walks
out of my office,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.387 align:middle line:84%
I very seldom ever remember
anything in a reading.

00:17:50.387 --> 00:17:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, but
when you tell somebody,

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:84%
your father has
committed suicide, that's

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.105 align:middle line:90%
not easy to tell somebody.

00:17:56.105 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: No.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.403 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely is not an
easy thing to tell someone.

00:18:00.403 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And
Brittany, how did you

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:10%
take it when she told you that?

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHNEIDER: I was
very obviously upset.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:10%
I was crying a lot.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:10%
But in some sense, it was
almost like she just told me

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:10%
what I was already
feeling inside anyways.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:10%
So it was in a
sense a big relief.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:10%
That sounds very-- it's not
the best word to describe it,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:10%
but it did feel like a bit
of a weight off my shoulders.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:32.150 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, after
that reading, I--

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.970 align:middle line:10%
it was amazing.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:10%
I felt great.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:10%
I got to hear from my dad.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:90%
And I told my mom about it.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
great, as well.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:10%
But the craziest
part was actually

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.180 align:middle line:10%
April of this year in 2020,
when I got a phone call

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:10%
from a family member saying that
they had actually found my dad.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't that no one
had been looking for him

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.660 align:middle line:10%
specifically.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:10%
I believe there was actually
a person with dementia

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.600 align:middle line:10%
who had gone missing
from a home of some sort.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:10%
And there was-- that might
have been linked to why

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:10%
people were looking around.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.930 align:middle line:10%
But there was a Park Ranger
in a park in North Vancouver--

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:10%
beautiful wooded area
with a stream nearby--

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:10%
and that was where
my dad was found.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.650 align:middle line:10%
His remains were found there.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:10%
And it was April, 2020,
a year after we found out

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:10%
he was missing.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:26.010 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did you get
the closure you needed?

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:26.810 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHNEIDER: I did.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:10%
And it was a weird time
in between that reading

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:10%
and April of 2020 that my
dad was actually found.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:10%
Because when I
had the reading, I

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.115 align:middle line:10%
believed it in my whole heart.

00:19:37.115 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:10%
I was like, yes, this is
what happened to my dad.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.400 align:middle line:10%
But then there's still
a tiny human part of me

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:10%
that was like, well, no, I don't
have the physical conformation.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.945 align:middle line:10%
So it was this weird mourning
and grieving process.

00:19:51.945 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:10%
And I was flip-flopping,
flip-flopping.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.950 align:middle line:10%
So when I had that actual
confirmation in April,

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.410 align:middle line:10%
it was just like, wow.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:10%
It was heartbreaking all
over again, very deeply.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.231 align:middle line:10%
But I just--

00:20:06.231 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was just crazy
how accurate Patricia was.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And it actually prompted me to
book a second reading with her.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
advice would you

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:84%
give people who have missing
loved ones in their lives, who

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.880 align:middle line:90%
don't know where they are?

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Should they go to a
psychic like Patricia?

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHNEIDER: I mean, for me, it
was an incredible experience,

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.560 align:middle line:10%
and I cannot say enough
positive things about it,

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:10%
but I do realize that every
person is very different.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:10%
And everyone handles
things differently.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:10%
And so I think if that's
something that speaks to you,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:10%
I think you should
really go with that.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:10%
But if it's something that
it's not your pace or not

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:10%
your style, then maybe not.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:10%
But for me personally, it
was an incredible experience,

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:10%
and I will do it--

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:10%
I would have done it
a hundred times over.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:10%
And I've been talking to
my close friends and family

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.030 align:middle line:10%
about it, just
absolutely in awe.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.653 align:middle line:10%
My wish is that everyone would
speak to someone like her

00:21:04.653 --> 00:21:05.820 align:middle line:10%
at some point in their life.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:10%
And even if you're skeptical,
it was life-changing for me.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, Brittany, our
condolences on your loss.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to have Patricia
say the final words to you.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:10%
>>MONNA: Thank you, Brittany,
so much for doing this.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, this
was so divinely timed

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
because for the past
about two years,

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I haven't taken on any personal
cases, meaning taking cases

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:90%
from family.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Unless it's police,
I don't really

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:84%
have the time, right,
because I volunteer.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:90%
I never get paid for this stuff.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:10%
So for her to be
able to walk in--

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:10%
and this just
happened on I think

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.560 align:middle line:10%
it was Wednesday or Thursday--

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:10%
I think it was Thursday-- where
she walked in, and we were

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:10%
having--

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:10%
the RCMP, they can't
just talk to media.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:84%
It's got to go through legal
teams, all of that, right?

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going, oh, my god.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Out of 27 missing
people, there's

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:84%
got to be someone that'll come
and do this, right, and talk.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:90%
And in walks Brittany.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And she's got-- as you can see,
she's absolutely stunning--

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.848 align:middle line:84%
wearing this
gorgeous white dress.

00:22:05.848 --> 00:22:06.890 align:middle line:10%
And then she sits there--

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.223 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Angelic looking, right?

00:22:08.223 --> 00:22:09.460 align:middle line:10%
>>MONNA: Totally angelic.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:10%
And I even said to her--

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.918 align:middle line:10%
I said, oh, my god,
girlfriend, you

00:22:11.918 --> 00:22:15.920 align:middle line:10%
are my angel,
because she sits down

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:10%
and she says to me,
Patricia, do you remember me?

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.460 align:middle line:90%
And I said to her--

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, you could have
been my kid's school teacher,

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:90%
and I'd believe it.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Remember me saying that?

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no,
I'm sorry, I don't.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Because when people
leave, everything

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:90%
is gone-- faces, names.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:90%
It walks out the door with them.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:33.785 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You move on?

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Totally.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's when she
said to me-- she goes,

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.390 align:middle line:84%
well, we found my dad right
where you said he'd be

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and the timeline and everything
that she just reiterated.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:10%
And my jaw was on
the floor going,

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:10%
you got to love how
the universe works,

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:10%
how it just pulls together in
the divine timing of things,

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:10%
because her instant
response was, sure,

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:10%
I would love to go on and
talk about this experience.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:01.910 align:middle line:10%
Hey, Brittany?

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:10%
And I only read for her the
one time before she came in.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.887 align:middle line:90%
And here's the clincher.

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:10.970 align:middle line:84%
It takes about two and a
half months, three months

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:90%
to get into me.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
She booked that
appointment months ago.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And her appointment
was on Thursday,

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.635 align:middle line:84%
right before I've got to get
on a flight and come to Gaia--

00:23:18.635 --> 00:23:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And come here.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: --and we needed--

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What timing.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: --someone to talk.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Totally divine timing.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Brittany, give
our incredible viewership

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:10%
a little goodbye.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:10%
>>SCHNEIDER: Thanks
so much for having me.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.153 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Thank you, Brittany.

00:23:33.153 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patricia, you're also
involved in remote viewing.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean for you?

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.781 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: So that's actually
one of the ways that I--

00:23:40.781 --> 00:23:41.890 align:middle line:90%
what I utilize to find--

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To find people?

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.015 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: --missing persons.

00:23:44.015 --> 00:23:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
When I tune into that
higher consciousness

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:84%
or go into that realm,
there's no such thing as time.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.412 align:middle line:90%
So you can look forward.

00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:90%
You can look backwards.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:84%
You can look into what's
happening right now.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And to me, in my mind,
it plays out almost

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.350 align:middle line:84%
like a movie, where I can see
everything that's happening,

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.355 align:middle line:84%
feel the emotions behind it,
and to be able to connect

00:24:07.355 --> 00:24:08.155 align:middle line:90%
with the targets.

00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.923 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: It's pretty neat.

00:24:09.923 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a great ability.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: And when it
comes to the drawings

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that you normally see
with remote viewers,

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:84%
for me, I draw out
the whole scenario.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm drawing out the
buildings and what's

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:84%
happening around the
target, not just the target.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Patricia, you use
remote viewing a lot

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:90%
in your missing people cases.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
the Blanco River case.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.004 align:middle line:90%
Now what is this?

00:24:37.004 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: So this-- these
are the pins that I dropped

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to
provide for the search

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and rescue that we're involved
in Wimberley, Texas, when

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.420 align:middle line:90%
the floods hit in 2015.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So there was a house
that got swept away

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:90%
with eight people in it.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And right from the get go, when
I was called into the case,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I told them that I would
only be able to find six out

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:90%
of eight of the missing people.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So these are just an
example of some of my pins

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.807 align:middle line:84%
of where people have been
found and how accurate--

00:25:10.807 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is accurate, indeed.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yeah.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sad, though, to
find these people this way.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: It is.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely is.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:84%
But I got to tell you, to be
able to do something and give

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:84%
back in a way that's
so rare, I feel

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.920 align:middle line:84%
like it's my God-given
duty to be able to do it.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
call psychic archaeology?

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: So it's something
that is extremely new to me.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
it was a thing.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I ended up being
invited on a radio show.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.440 align:middle line:90%
And one of the call-in--

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.703 align:middle line:90%
or one of the viewers, sorry--

00:25:41.703 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One of the callers.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: One of the
callers had asked me

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.370 align:middle line:84%
if I had ever done
psychic archaeology.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And he contacted
me after the show

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and asked me if I would
do some remote viewing

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:59.220 align:middle line:84%
into the structures of the
pyramids and ones in Peru.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know, I was
seeing things just as clearly

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:84%
as I do with remote viewing
and finding missing people.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Uri Geller, of course, on
Gaia's "Legacy" program,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
talked about how he uses
dowsing to find things.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:10%
>>URI GELLER: One of the
big finds that I always

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:10%
talk about was when General
Moshe Dayan asked me

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:10%
here in Israel to drive
with him in his Jeep

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:31.350 align:middle line:10%
and locate ancient
archaeological items that

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:10%
were buried in sand, in caves.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And we drove to
Ashkelon, to the beach.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would just walk with
him with my hands stretched

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:90%
And I would say, here, dig here.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.370 align:middle line:90%
And he would have a shovel.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And he would dig out
whatever I found.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.790 align:middle line:90%
It's basically honing my mind.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:58.470 align:middle line:84%
If I look for oil, then
I focus my mind onto oil.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:90%
I visualize oil.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:05.100 align:middle line:84%
If I'm looking for an
ancient lamp or a sculpture

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:84%
or a piece of antiquity,
I just visualize

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:90%
something very ancient.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And my mind allows me to
locate it very precisely.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:10%
I remember the time
when the president

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:25.710 align:middle line:10%
of Mexico, Lopez Portillo, asked
me to look for oil for Pemex.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Pemex is the national
oil company of Mexico.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a helicopter
over the Gulf of Mexico.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I had a map on my knees.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.070 align:middle line:84%
When I felt that I'm
flying over a place,

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.740 align:middle line:84%
I would tell the pilot,
hover, come lower.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I would put
a big X on the map.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:90%
And they found oil there.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Oil came gushing out of there.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.540 align:middle line:84%
The president was so
impressed that he made me

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.860 align:middle line:90%
a Mexican citizen.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.585 align:middle line:84%
I actually have a
Mexican passport.

00:27:58.585 --> 00:27:59.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uri Geller's amazing.

00:27:59.835 --> 00:28:01.350 align:middle line:90%
He's a dear friend of mine.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And he was on "The Johnny
Carson Show" many years ago

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and was so nervous
because of the things

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:84%
they were pushing at him,
he couldn't do what he did.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:90%
But he's an outstanding guy.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
But with that, dowsing, do
you have that ability, too?

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Absolutely.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:84%
That's how I found
many a missing person.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And the way he said
that he takes his mind

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and he projects it there,
that's exactly what I do.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.150 align:middle line:84%
If I'm looking for
a missing person

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:31.170 align:middle line:84%
or I'm looking into the pyramids
of Egypt, it's all energy.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:90%
It's all consciousness.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you know how to tune
into someone's resonance--

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.170 align:middle line:90%
and here's the neat thing.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.560 align:middle line:84%
We all have a resonant
signature, each and every one

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:90%
of us, that is unique to us--

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We do?

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: --just like
our fingerprints--

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK,

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: --right?

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.230 align:middle line:90%
So it's my job, if I--

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.400 align:middle line:90%
and by looking at a photo.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.910 align:middle line:84%
All I need is a photo
of a, we'll say,

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.020 align:middle line:84%
a missing person in
order to be able to tune

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:53.895 align:middle line:90%
into their resonance.

00:28:53.895 --> 00:28:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you need a piece of
clothes or anything like that?

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: No, pictures
help me more.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a picture?

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:58.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:28:59.123 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Absolutely.

00:28:59.123 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Pictures and I get it like that.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I'm remote
viewing on a target that I

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:84%
have no idea, because
I've done what

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.370 align:middle line:90%
Uri Geller has done before--

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and I'll show you
my drawings after,

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.990 align:middle line:84%
where it describes the whole
story of the target, not just

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.015 align:middle line:90%
the target.

00:29:17.015 --> 00:29:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
pretty elaborate.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yeah.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.558 align:middle line:84%
It plays out like
the whole thing does.

00:29:21.558 --> 00:29:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You do a
lot of predictions.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yes.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been some
of your past predictions

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:90%
that have come true?

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Easier said than done, but--

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Well--

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.502 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --what are they?

00:29:32.502 --> 00:29:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: --there's been
good, bad, everything.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the craziest predictions
that I ever did was I

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.290 align:middle line:84%
predicted a lady winning the
lottery right down to the day

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:90%
that she won the lottery.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she won?

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: I wrote down two dates.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:90%
I said--

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you know her?

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: No.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, she had come to
me for a reading before.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.770 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote down two dates.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:56.280 align:middle line:84%
I said, November 27, you're
going to buy the ticket.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.440 align:middle line:84%
December 2, you're going
to find out you won.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.255 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
two dates, exactly--

00:30:00.255 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fantastic.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: --right
down to the days.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.405 align:middle line:90%
It was $7 million.

00:30:03.405 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't little.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: It was $7 million.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Make a
prediction for me.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: [LAUGHS]

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Electronic voice phenomenon.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yes.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You captured some of
this in one of your readings

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.100 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:16.995 align:middle line:90%
let's listen to this.

00:30:16.995 --> 00:30:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: This was found in
my office or tape-recorded

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.920 align:middle line:90%
in my office by a client.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.512 align:middle line:10%
The more you even
say to your angels

00:30:24.512 --> 00:30:26.970 align:middle line:10%
and your guides, OK, I'm ready,
I'm ready, show me, show me

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:27.900 align:middle line:10%
what I need to know--

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.220 align:middle line:10%
>> They'll show you.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MONNA: That whole ask
and ye shall receive stuff,

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:10%
it's very true.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.077 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Totally true.

00:30:34.077 --> 00:30:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, they
weren't in the office.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.080 align:middle line:90%
They weren't anywhere.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: My client
was recording it.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.410 align:middle line:84%
She's the one who caught
the voice on tape.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was when she was playing
back the recording for her mom

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:90%
that her mom heard the voice.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm
channeling, and when

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.195 align:middle line:84%
spirit is speaking
through me, it

00:30:51.195 --> 00:30:53.070 align:middle line:84%
seems-- it sounds like
I'm talking to myself.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it's
not like I'm hearing

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:90%
some guy's voice in my head.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:56.490 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like that.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:58.410 align:middle line:90%
But I heard those words.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you slow down
the tape, you'll realize,

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I paused because I tend to
talk fast when I channel

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.820 align:middle line:90%
or when I get nervous.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was when I was
pausing that that's

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.630 align:middle line:84%
when his words came out,
but those were the words

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.000 align:middle line:90%
that I heard in my head to say.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Patricia, what
do you see in the future

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.360 align:middle line:90%
a few years from now?

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.090 align:middle line:90%
How are things for us?

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Oh.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to be
very honest, George.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You always are.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: I do.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I tell the good, the bad,
the ugly, the all of it.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I think we're facing
some hard times ahead.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
of the pandemic?

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Yes.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's going
to continue years ahead?

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.645 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: It will.

00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:37.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, god.

00:31:37.445 --> 00:31:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: It will.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.467 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're over it
or out of the clear quite yet.

00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they always
things that you predict, things

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.560 align:middle line:90%
that will be or could be?

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean can we--
if you make a prediction,

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.640 align:middle line:84%
can we alter it by
the things we do?

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:84%
We can alter it
by the knowledge.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is power, right?

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But I truly believe
that some things

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely
ingrained in stone

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:07.405 align:middle line:84%
like our birth, our death,
and certain things in between.

00:32:07.405 --> 00:32:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So at a time where
we meet our soulmate

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.250 align:middle line:84%
or you just meet that
person where you're like,

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:13.050 align:middle line:90%
how do I know you?

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:13.850 align:middle line:90%
How do I know you?

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Why does it feel that
instant connection?

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe that those meetings
and that time and space,

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.940 align:middle line:90%
it's meant to happen.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're recognizing
that person or that situation

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:26.190 align:middle line:90%
as part of our life.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.670 align:middle line:90%
I think it's meant to happen.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it's malleable.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.910 align:middle line:90%
We can move it.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:35.010 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain things
that no matter where you are,

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:35.970 align:middle line:90%
it's going to happen.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:39.512 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the long run,
as people, will we be OK?

00:32:39.512 --> 00:32:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Oh, gosh, yes.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.920 align:middle line:84%
We've been here for thousands
and thousands of years.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
anywhere anytime soon.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
people track you?

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Website?

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:48.950 align:middle line:10%
What do you have?

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:51.860 align:middle line:10%
>>MONNA: Www.PatriciaMonna.com.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: M-O-N-N-A?

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.700 align:middle line:10%
>>MONNA: Yeah.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.825 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: PatriciaMonna.com.

00:32:54.825 --> 00:32:56.070 align:middle line:10%
>>MONNA: Dot com.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:33:00.180 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, I teach psychic
development classes,

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.440 align:middle line:10%
meditations, as well as
I'm going to Ancient Egypt

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.580 align:middle line:10%
next year to go and
see and feel what

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.800 align:middle line:10%
it was that I remote viewed.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So Johnny Enoch is a
good friend of mine.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.252 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:33:15.252 --> 00:33:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: I'm going
on tour with him

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:84%
next year so that I can
go and read the pyramids,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.270 align:middle line:84%
because the hieroglyphs
make sense to me, all of it

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.070 align:middle line:90%
makes sense to me.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My late father
was born in Cairo.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MONNA: Wow.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was right there
a long, long time ago.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, Patricia, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.500 align:middle line:90%
We appreciate it.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MONNA: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What a
great, great thing

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.740 align:middle line:10%
she does for people--
finding missing people,

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:41.430 align:middle line:10%
helping law enforcement,
helping people get closure.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
