[ Silence ]

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.281 align:middle line:84%
2 [Background Music] And I think
many people today don't know

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.482 align:middle line:90%
what to believe anymore.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.085 align:middle line:84%
People are basically
going to keep on them

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:19.886 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:22.355 align:middle line:84%
I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:31.431 align:middle line:84%
We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:32.966 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told the
entire story.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.234 align:middle line:90%

[applause] and  Guy MTV
bring you  Beyond Belief

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:39.906 align:middle line:90%
with George Norry.

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.675 align:middle line:90%
Well, hello!

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:48.548 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that 98% of
reality, 98% is simply unseen,

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:53.587 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of it has to
do with subtle energy.

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Our very special guest tonight
on  Beyond Belief , Cyndi Dale,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.761 align:middle line:84%
noted author who deals
with energy healing.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.764 align:middle line:84%
Here she is; Cyndi,
come on out [applause].

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Hi! Hi, George!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.702 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:09.703 align:middle line:90%
I'm honored to be here.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:10.537 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:11.771 align:middle line:90%
I felt a burst of energy just...

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:12.539 align:middle line:90%
There we go!

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.874 align:middle line:90%
...hugging you like that.

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:14.941 align:middle line:84%
98%, we want to know what
that's really doing, don't we?

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.475 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:16.042 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.544 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy yourself.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.012 align:middle line:90%
What are these?

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:20.514 align:middle line:90%
Aren't those nifty?

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:22.449 align:middle line:84%
Well, I bet you're never going
to guess where they're from.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.017 align:middle line:84%
Take a guess at where
this might be from.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:27.354 align:middle line:84%
This is a dinosaur
tooth [laughter].

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:29.189 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] I'd be rich if
this was a dinosaur tooth.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:29.923 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.958 align:middle line:90%
That's a Mayan stone.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.961 align:middle line:84%
I have been fascinated
with subtle energy ever

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:90%
since I was a little girl.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.632 align:middle line:84%
I was one of those
kind of strange kids

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.734 align:middle line:84%
who could see angels,
and hear ghosts...

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:42.702 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...and colors
that came out of people.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:45.338 align:middle line:84%
And my family -- white, Wonder
bread, Norwegian, Lutheran...

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:48.041 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...may I add -- thought
I was kind of strange, so I --

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I really couldn't study
much of those phenomenon

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.813 align:middle line:84%
until I was older, and then
I traveled quite a bit.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:56.416 align:middle line:84%
So this is a stone that's
actually from a Mayan ruin ...

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:57.484 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible].

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:01.254 align:middle line:84%
...that I discovered
in a cave in Belize.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.956 align:middle line:90%
That could be worth something.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:07.427 align:middle line:84%
Well, I could take this right
now [whistling] [laughter]...

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.094 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:08.862 align:middle line:90%
What -- what is it?

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.263 align:middle line:90%
It's a new dinosaur tooth.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.732 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's kind of a funny
story that goes with that stone.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:13.266 align:middle line:90%
It's heavy.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:13.833 align:middle line:90%
It's heavy.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:14.868 align:middle line:90%
Very heavy.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:15.936 align:middle line:84%
But at one point,
I actually believe,

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.205 align:middle line:84%
it was a bit more
animate or conscious

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:19.673 align:middle line:90%
than we think that stones are.

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:22.576 align:middle line:84%
And that's what subtle energy
is, it's all that unknown.

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:24.177 align:middle line:90%
It's that 98%...

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.313 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...of what's going
on behind the scenes

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:27.681 align:middle line:90%
that we don't tap into.

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:31.551 align:middle line:84%
So I found this stone, bound
it up, put it in lots and lots

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.153 align:middle line:90%
of newspaper and bags.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.322 align:middle line:84%
I was leading a group down
in Belize at the time.

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:39.292 align:middle line:84%
Okay. We got back in the bus,
and it started getting hot,

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:90%
starting heating up in my hand.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.027 align:middle line:90%
The stone?

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:41.761 align:middle line:90%
The stone did.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.028 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't hot right now.

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:45.765 align:middle line:84%
We should -- I think the
switch turned off or something.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.835 align:middle line:84%
But we started passing
the stone around.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.503 align:middle line:84%
It got hotter, and
hotter, and hotter,

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.306 align:middle line:84%
and nobody could really
even touch it after a while.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.442 align:middle line:84%
And then -- I do
intuitive work...

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:58.845 align:middle line:84%
Okay. ...so kind of from that
inside place I had this sense

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.146 align:middle line:84%
that there actually
was some kind

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.182 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness in that stone.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So being naturally greedy -- we
Norwegians tend to be that way;

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.388 align:middle line:90%
that's the Vikings in us...

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:09.522 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. ...I think [laughter].

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.925 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, what's
it going to do for us?"

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.127 align:middle line:84%
And I really do believe I
heard a voice that said, "Well,

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.129 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to grant
witches -- wishes.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:17.564 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe witches [chuckle].

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:18.265 align:middle line:90%
You -- you never know.

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:18.832 align:middle line:90%
It could be either way.

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:19.499 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:20.333 align:middle line:90%
So we passed...

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:21.101 align:middle line:90%
We've dealt with all of them.

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:22.602 align:middle line:90%
I bet you have.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:26.606 align:middle line:84%
So we passed the darn stone
around; everybody made a wish,

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:29.976 align:middle line:84%
stopped being hot, and you know
within two months everybody

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.144 align:middle line:90%
on the trip had their wish met.

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.046 align:middle line:90%
No! I'm not kidding.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.414 align:middle line:84%
It's worth a lot
more than you think.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:35.715 align:middle line:90%
It's an Aladdin stone.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.083 align:middle line:84%
Maybe -- maybe we'll all be
wishing on it [laughter].

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:38.418 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into some
of that, too, but tell me...

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.786 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.254 align:middle line:84%
...a little bit about when you
talk about subtle energy...

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.622 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. What -- what
are we talking about?

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:46.026 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not talking about
anything really that different

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:49.028 align:middle line:90%
than energy as a general term.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.197 align:middle line:84%
And when most of us went
through school we were told

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
that energy is the force
that makes things happen...

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.068 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...that pushes
things forward.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:58.672 align:middle line:84%
And it does, but they
failed to teach us

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:00.874 align:middle line:84%
that there's two
different speeds of energy.

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:03.209 align:middle line:84%
Energy's really information
that moves.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.879 align:middle line:84%
So there's information that
tells a stone to be a stone.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.181 align:middle line:84%
There's information that tells
that stone to be a stone,

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:09.683 align:middle line:90%
or a thought to be a thought,

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.117 align:middle line:84%
and everything's
always moving...

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:13.253 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. ...within those objects.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:17.857 align:middle line:84%
But subtle energy is that 98%
of the energy that we don't see,

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:19.826 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
how quite to measure

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:22.629 align:middle line:84%
or very easily measure
right now.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.865 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually information
that moves, but it moves faster

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:28.768 align:middle line:84%
than the speed of light,
whereas what we're able to see

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.237 align:middle line:84%
in this stone is
energy that moves slower

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:32.505 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.208 align:middle line:84%
So subtle energy is basically
energy that moves faster

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:36.576 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:38.645 align:middle line:84%
Now, was this energy -- when
the universe was created, say...

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:39.946 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.414 align:middle line:90%
...was it always there?

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, where did
it come from?

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.919 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's kind of the
big bang argument, isn't it?

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.854 align:middle line:90%
It's always been there.

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:50.924 align:middle line:84%
And if we study quantum
physics, which is kind

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
of that ooey [phonetic],
spooky kind of physics that is

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.263 align:middle line:84%
of so much interest these days
because it's the only brand

00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:01.167 align:middle line:84%
of science that really explains
the inevitable, invisible,

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
you know kind of what
makes things really happen.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.573 align:middle line:84%
That energy was there; it
was just very condensed.

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:08.108 align:middle line:84%
You know it could
have been as --

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:11.444 align:middle line:84%
as you know condensed in an --
an area smaller than this, or...

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:14.114 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...smaller than a
pinprick, or a molecule.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
The question usually is
did that energy exist

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.853 align:middle line:84%
in bigger form before,
which it probably did,

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and then collapsed, and then
opened up and spread out again.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.393 align:middle line:84%
So that energy's
always been there.

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:29.162 align:middle line:84%
And even now scientists
will tell you

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:32.699 align:middle line:84%
out in the universe most energy
is what they call dark matter.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:33.767 align:middle line:90%
Right. We can't measure it.

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:34.334 align:middle line:90%
We can't measure it.

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:34.901 align:middle line:90%
We can't see it.

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.302 align:middle line:90%
We can't see it.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:39.339 align:middle line:84%
So wouldn't that be a fun job,
to be a scientist and sit around

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.707 align:middle line:84%
and figure out all the
things you can't see?

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.175 align:middle line:90%
I like my job better than that.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.443 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] You have a fun job.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:45.345 align:middle line:84%
Because I get to talk to
people like you all the time.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.679 align:middle line:84%
You talk to really
cool people...

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.448 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...about really
interesting things.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So the energy's always
been there.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.587 align:middle line:84%
It's just about is it
appearing, or is it in a form

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:58.691 align:middle line:84%
where as human beings
we can't perceive it?

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But we perceive very
little energy.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.432 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our eyes only
see 2% of visual light.

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:08.435 align:middle line:84%
But you know some
people give off energy.

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:09.669 align:middle line:90%
Yes. You can feel it.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:10.637 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:12.338 align:middle line:84%
They walk into a
room, you just know.

00:06:12.338 --> 00:06:12.972 align:middle line:90%
You just know.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:13.606 align:middle line:90%
They -- they glow.

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:14.441 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:16.109 align:middle line:90%
People want to be around them.

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:17.143 align:middle line:90%
Or conversely.

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:18.111 align:middle line:90%
Or the other way.

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.379 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. There's
some other people

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.313 align:middle line:90%
that suck energy from you.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:21.815 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like a black hole.

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:22.649 align:middle line:90%
Right. Yep, a vampire.

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, you've seen them both.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.218 align:middle line:90%
How do you react to that?

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:90%
How do you handle the person --

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.722 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the
vampire, first of all.

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:31.691 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. And -- and they
call them psychic vampires.

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
They do. How do you
react to that person

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.762 align:middle line:84%
who may not even know
what they're doing...

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:36.596 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.730 align:middle line:90%
...but they come into a room ...

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.731 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.467 align:middle line:84%
...and they can literally
empty it.

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:41.801 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it happen before.

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.536 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it happen;
I've experienced it.

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:44.604 align:middle line:90%
I... It's sad.

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.039 align:middle line:84%
It's -- it's very
sad, and they don't --

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:47.841 align:middle line:90%
don't usually know it, either.

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:49.242 align:middle line:90%
They don't succeed in life.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Right. They don't know why.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.713 align:middle line:84%
Right. They claim that there's
a cloud over their head.

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:55.248 align:middle line:84%
Kind of Pig-Pen in
Charlie Brown.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
They're -- they're
miserable within themselves.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.485 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they are.

00:06:58.485 --> 00:07:00.353 align:middle line:84%
And they have difficult
times in relationships.

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:01.287 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:03.656 align:middle line:90%
All these things happen to them.

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:04.491 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:06.426 align:middle line:90%
Do they create that themselves?

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Or were the just
dealt the wrong cards?

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.433 align:middle line:84%
Well, at some level
they're creating it.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.236 align:middle line:84%
I happen to believe,
however, at least 80%

00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:19.472 align:middle line:84%
of the issues affecting
us didn't start with us,

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:22.475 align:middle line:84%
that there's not a lot
of destiny [chuckle]

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.478 align:middle line:84%
by the time we even come out of
the womb that we're really able

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:90%
to steer or be in charge of.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.251 align:middle line:84%
You know this person, Cyndi
Dale, is a product of my soul,

00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:33.586 align:middle line:84%
you know where I've been
and what I've done before,

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:36.189 align:middle line:84%
but also my family system,
where everybody's been,

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:37.957 align:middle line:90%
and what they've done before.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.693 align:middle line:84%
You know what my culture has
taught me, and there's a lot

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
of factors even in deciding how
my family system affects me.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.466 align:middle line:90%
Around the genes, for instance,

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.302 align:middle line:84%
there's a chemical suit
called the "epigenetics"

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.505 align:middle line:84%
that contains all our
ancestors' memories,

00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:55.675 align:middle line:84%
so great grandma could
be inside of me saying,

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:58.211 align:middle line:84%
"Just take advantage of them,"
or, "You'll never get ahead

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.213 align:middle line:84%
if you don't steal
people's energy."

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:03.249 align:middle line:84%
Or let's say I'm born to
the type of mom or dad

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.919 align:middle line:84%
who really didn't want
me, maybe I was adopted...

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.053 align:middle line:90%
Who would not want you?

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.321 align:middle line:90%
Well, me, yes [laughter].

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:12.926 align:middle line:84%
But you know that's what
happens with a lot of the people

00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:16.429 align:middle line:84%
who vampire or steal
other's subtle energy,

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.097 align:middle line:84%
is maybe they weren't
wanted as a kid,

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:20.166 align:middle line:84%
and so they weren't
given anything.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.434 align:middle line:84%
So what are you going to
do if you're not getting...

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:22.201 align:middle line:90%
Right. You -- you take it.

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:22.735 align:middle line:90%
...if you're not given...

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:90%
You take it.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.238 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're going to --
you're going to steal.

00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's -- let's get a show of
hands just from the audience.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.041 align:middle line:90%
How many of you have come

00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.877 align:middle line:84%
across these psychic
vampires in your life?

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:90%
They just exhaust you, even you.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.514 align:middle line:90%
How old are you, by the way?

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.748 align:middle line:90%
Nine. Nine years old.

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.416 align:middle line:90%
You've come across that already.

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:41.554 align:middle line:84%
Almost everyone has that person
in their life that they knew --

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.489 align:middle line:84%
I've got a great story,
Cyndi, got to tell you,

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:48.494 align:middle line:84%
back in St. Lewis there's a
nice lounge, bar, restaurant,

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:49.829 align:middle line:90%
at the Ritz Carlton there.

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:52.765 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And it's very close
to my house, and it's close

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.201 align:middle line:84%
to the cave, the
studio in St. Lewis.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.036 align:middle line:84%
And I would frequent
there a lot.

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.372 align:middle line:84%
It'd be very simple
to get there.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:04.711 align:middle line:84%
There was always a guy
sitting at this lounge bar,

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.879 align:middle line:90%
and nobody was around the guy.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:07.447 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no. Ever.

00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:08.448 align:middle line:90%
And that's sad.

00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:12.685 align:middle line:84%
And within 20 minutes
most of people

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:16.623 align:middle line:90%
in that lobby lounge left.

00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:19.492 align:middle line:84%
And the manager couldn't
figure out what was wrong.

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:22.662 align:middle line:84%
He would -- he would
have consultants come in,

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:25.465 align:middle line:84%
and they would look at the
décor, and they'd change it.

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:26.733 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not it.

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:29.669 align:middle line:84%
They would look at the
bartenders; they'd change them.

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:33.906 align:middle line:84%
They would look at the
prices; they fixed them.

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:37.944 align:middle line:84%
Yet every time they did that,
and there's -- here's this guy;

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:41.414 align:middle line:84%
he's always there sitting in
the -- in his little spot.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.416 align:middle line:84%
People would leave
within 20 minutes.

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.886 align:middle line:84%
It never dawned on him
that it was that guy.

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:50.123 align:middle line:84%
One day -- I had -- I had
observed this over the course

00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:53.826 align:middle line:84%
of about a year, and I knew
exactly what was going on.

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:55.995 align:middle line:90%
Not a bad guy except he just...

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:57.397 align:middle line:90%
It's a pattern.

00:09:57.397 --> 00:09:58.998 align:middle line:90%
...made you uncomfortable.

00:09:58.998 --> 00:09:59.565 align:middle line:90%
Kind of creepy.

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:00.233 align:middle line:90%
Just... Mm-hmm.

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:01.801 align:middle line:90%
He just drained you.

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:04.003 align:middle line:84%
You could go in there
with energy;

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.304 align:middle line:90%
you could walk out like this.

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:06.639 align:middle line:90%
Exhausted.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And after a year I said, "You
know what, he's doing it;

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.546 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know it, and
I went to talk to him.

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.748 align:middle line:84%
And when you talked to the
guy -- his name was Andy.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:17.717 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. Poor Andy.

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:18.951 align:middle line:90%
Yeah [chuckle].

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:22.822 align:middle line:84%
He -- he would literally
drain you in a conversation.

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:25.258 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say anything
bad; he was a nice guy.

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I know he -- he just --
just sucks out of you.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.295 align:middle line:84%
But it was just -- he
just kept sucking it out.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm I started
telling him, "Andy,

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.633 align:middle line:84%
you've got to change some
things about your life,"

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:37.236 align:middle line:84%
because he kept sharing me
that nothing worked for him.

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:41.841 align:middle line:84%
He'd been divorced; his kids
didn't talk to him; I mean,

00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:44.477 align:middle line:84%
you name it; it all
happened to him.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.446 align:middle line:84%
And I started working
with him about that.

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:47.647 align:middle line:84%
Many of the things
that you've got

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:50.083 align:middle line:84%
in  The Subtle Body
Encyclopedia ...

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:51.751 align:middle line:90%
Encyclopedia , mm-hmm.

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.053 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, he changed
his image a little bit.

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:55.555 align:middle line:90%
He changed is style.

00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:59.592 align:middle line:84%
He was a little more
outgoing to people.

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:03.463 align:middle line:84%
Rather than being negative
when somebody came up to him,

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:05.865 align:middle line:84%
it was partly sunny,
not partly cloudy.

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:10.937 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. And within six months
the Ritz Carlton noticed

00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:90%
that more people were coming in.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.708 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that fascinating?

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:19.979 align:middle line:84%
And he somehow was able to
get rid of that negativity

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:90%
that he had around him.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.315 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:23.616 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you mean
by the subtle energy?

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.084 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I mean.

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:28.187 align:middle line:84%
It's that energy that's inside
of us, that's around us.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:32.625 align:middle line:84%
It's the unseen self who's
very, very busy responding

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:36.028 align:middle line:84%
to what happened in
childhood, maybe before then;

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:38.398 align:middle line:84%
responding to what's
happening in the room.

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:41.033 align:middle line:90%
And is patterned to respond.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:44.537 align:middle line:84%
It's really literally telling
people how to treat us.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:48.241 align:middle line:84%
So my subtle energy, that
invisible energy that is me,

00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:52.044 align:middle line:84%
which is, again, I think at
least 98% more than what it is

00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:53.579 align:middle line:84%
that you're seeing;
it's all front-loaded.

00:11:53.579 --> 00:11:54.947 align:middle line:84%
You're -- you're
giving off energy.

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:55.782 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] I am.

00:11:55.782 --> 00:11:56.415 align:middle line:90%
I mean, can you feel it here?

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:57.817 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:11:57.817 --> 00:12:00.853 align:middle line:84%
Well [laughter], it's because
I'm happy to be here you know.

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:01.854 align:middle line:90%
Good. Yeah.

00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:02.889 align:middle line:84%
Where'd you -- where'd
you fly in from?

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:03.589 align:middle line:90%
Minneapolis.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:04.657 align:middle line:90%
Oh, okay. Great town.

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:05.491 align:middle line:90%
I lived there for a year.

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:06.425 align:middle line:90%
I -- I -- oh, it's a fun city.

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:06.993 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it is.

00:12:06.993 --> 00:12:08.327 align:middle line:90%
It's very warm.

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.663 align:middle line:84%
Yes. I do have to say that
being her I am missing a couple

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:13.399 align:middle line:84%
14-year-old baseball games,
and I hate admitting I'm kind

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.134 align:middle line:90%
of happy to miss those.

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.803 align:middle line:90%
It's like 45 degrees at home.

00:12:16.803 --> 00:12:17.737 align:middle line:90%
Yep. It's not -- talk about...

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:18.404 align:middle line:90%
It's not the same.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:19.405 align:middle line:90%
...an energy drain.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.174 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. [Laughter]
Nothing worse than a --

00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
wearing three blankets while
you're watching the ball go not

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.444 align:middle line:84%
the way it's supposed
to, anyway.

00:12:25.444 --> 00:12:31.884 align:middle line:84%
Well, with -- with subtle
energy can people like Andy,

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:35.154 align:middle line:84%
without knowing it, changing
some things primarily

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:84%
because I helped him, can
they do it on their own?

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.993 align:middle line:84%
How do these people
know what they're doing

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:42.261 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, quite often people
don't know what they're doing.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.364 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
we're responding to.

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:50.369 align:middle line:84%
We don't know that we're drawing
those layoffs to us potentially;

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:52.738 align:middle line:84%
we don't know that the reason
people turn a little sour

00:12:52.738 --> 00:12:56.209 align:middle line:84%
around us, or happy around
us, or interested in us,

00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:58.611 align:middle line:84%
has to do with what it
is that we're emanating.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.479 align:middle line:90%
So you're exactly right, George.

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:02.748 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we have to
do is become aware of it,

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:90%
that we play a role in it.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:08.254 align:middle line:84%
Not in a way that we shame
ourselves, that we feel either

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:10.723 align:middle line:84%
like we're the victim
of how we were raised

00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:13.259 align:middle line:84%
or how we've been trained
to be, but once we start

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:16.229 align:middle line:84%
to become aware, you know
really then our mind kicks in;

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:18.631 align:middle line:84%
our brain kicks in
and starts to say,

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:22.468 align:middle line:84%
"Let's change the information
in that subtle energy."

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.805 align:middle line:84%
So instead of telling people,
"I'm kind of a bad person," or,

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.707 align:middle line:84%
"I'm a sucker for
bad deals," or,

00:13:27.707 --> 00:13:29.809 align:middle line:84%
"I need to marry another
alcoholic," all right,

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.143 align:middle line:90%
that's a good one, right?

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Right. You know instead of
sending that information out,

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.783 align:middle line:84%
we can start to very consciously
decide what information we want

00:13:37.783 --> 00:13:42.121 align:middle line:84%
to send out and what it is we
want to hang around or receive.

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:44.390 align:middle line:84%
There's some very interesting
studies at Institute

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:84%
of HeartMath -- as an
example, that have showed

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.363 align:middle line:84%
that when people go into the
world coming from a place

00:13:50.363 --> 00:13:52.698 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude, a positive
emotion...

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:53.833 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. ...you know what?

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.468 align:middle line:84%
They just see more and
more to be grateful for.

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:56.035 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:56.869 align:middle line:90%
They're happy.

00:13:56.869 --> 00:13:58.070 align:middle line:90%
And they're healthier people.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.872 align:middle line:84%
They're healthier people;
their body's healthier;

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:01.107 align:middle line:90%
they get more promotions.

00:14:01.107 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. Because frankly
people trust them more.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And they see the connections
between things instead

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.115 align:middle line:90%
of the disconnections.

00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:11.651 align:middle line:84%
The American Heart Association
just came out with a report

00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:12.852 align:middle line:90%
that says if you have a pet...

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:16.422 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...a dog or a
cat, you are more likely

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:18.324 align:middle line:90%
to have less heart disease...

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:20.026 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...than somebody
who doesn't.

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.427 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:24.497 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions for
Cyndi Dale about subtle energy,

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:27.099 align:middle line:84%
about psychic vampires,
about positivity.

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:29.802 align:middle line:90%
Yes? Our little nine-year-old.

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:34.941 align:middle line:84%
When you feel like nobody
really wants to be around you,

00:14:34.941 --> 00:14:39.545 align:middle line:84%
and you're just not
around many people,

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.881 align:middle line:90%
what can that contribute to?

00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.716 align:middle line:90%
Well, it must makes me feel sad.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.652 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a sad kind of
situation when we feel

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:48.754 align:middle line:84%
like no one wants to be
around us, and we're not

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:90%
around a lot of people?

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.926 align:middle line:84%
You know so that could be
someplace inside, you know,

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:84%
where we have a lot of sadness
or we tell ourselves maybe

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.332 align:middle line:84%
that people aren't
going to like us.

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:01.701 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we don't know
where we get those messages

00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:05.738 align:middle line:84%
or where we get those inside
kind of voices, and so it's not

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.239 align:middle line:90%
that hard to change that.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:08.641 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news.

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:84%
To start telling ourselves, "You
know I'm a really cool person,"

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.715 align:middle line:84%
or to start catching
ourselves with compliments,

00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:18.584 align:middle line:84%
everything that we do,
even if we make a mistake.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:21.787 align:middle line:84%
You know I even give myself a
compliment when I make a mistake

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:23.189 align:middle line:90%
because somebody told me once

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:26.058 align:middle line:84%
that if you haven't made five
mistakes before breakfast you're

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:27.927 align:middle line:90%
not really trying anything new.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.997 align:middle line:84%
So [chuckle] I'm always telling
myself, "You did a good job

00:15:30.997 --> 00:15:32.932 align:middle line:90%
of screwing that up, Cyndi."

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.368 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
best thing to do is

00:15:35.368 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
to start really liking
ourselves,

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.305 align:middle line:84%
giving ourselves a
lot of compliments,

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:42.608 align:middle line:84%
and then people start
to like us even more.

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:45.177 align:middle line:84%
They start to go, "Hey,
that's a really nice person.

00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:47.947 align:middle line:84%
She really likes herself,"
or, "He really likes himself.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.716 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going
to like me."

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:53.285 align:middle line:84%
And you know that's kind
of another secret is

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:57.089 align:middle line:84%
if we show people we like them,
they tend to like us better.

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:59.692 align:middle line:84%
People like to think a
lot about themselves,

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.460 align:middle line:90%
and that's -- that's great.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.095 align:middle line:90%
So if you show interest in them,

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:04.997 align:middle line:84%
they'll probably show
some interest in you, too.

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:07.033 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for the question.

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.068 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a lot of friends?

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:10.603 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. I bet you do.

00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:11.704 align:middle line:90%
I bet you do.

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they don't
hang around with me.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.541 align:middle line:90%
It depends [laughter].

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:18.511 align:middle line:84%
And -- and they could just be
going through a bad day, too.

00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:19.111 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:20.246 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:22.681 align:middle line:84%
Well, we -- we've got
high technology here.

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:25.384 align:middle line:84%
We've got a question
from someone way

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:90%
out there for you, Cyndi.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.121 align:middle line:90%
Terrific. Hi, Cyndi.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.424 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jessica from Portland,
and I was wondering

00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:34.460 align:middle line:84%
if subtle energy affects
my ability to make money?

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.461 align:middle line:90%
Ah, subtle energy...

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:36.796 align:middle line:84%
Wow. ...and the ability
to make money.

00:16:36.796 --> 00:16:39.165 align:middle line:84%
You know what let's go right
to the pocketbook, right?

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:42.134 align:middle line:84%
Yep. It certainly does, and
we've almost been talking

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:44.904 align:middle line:84%
about that, you know, that
if we think we're worthy;

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:47.073 align:middle line:84%
if we think we deserve
to be rewarded,

00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:49.308 align:middle line:90%
to make money, to receive for...

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:50.376 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...everything
we're doing,

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:51.377 align:middle line:90%
guess what's going to happen?

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:52.578 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what's
going to happen.

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:53.879 align:middle line:90%
Positive things will happen.

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:55.981 align:middle line:84%
Positive things will happen,
or we'll leave a situation

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:84%
in which we're not
being rewarded

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.485 align:middle line:84%
because we'll feel
good about ourselves.

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:02.021 align:middle line:84%
But it's the subtle
energy that tells people --

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's kind
of like little Pac-Men

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.158 align:middle line:84%
that are leading
our body and going

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:08.193 align:middle line:84%
through what's called
our energetic field.

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
It's those little Pac-Men that
are telling people you know,

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.599 align:middle line:84%
"I really am not
worth very much," or,

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.134 align:middle line:84%
"You don't really have
to pay me very much."

00:17:16.134 --> 00:17:18.637 align:middle line:84%
So it's the messages
we're giving off

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:20.072 align:middle line:90%
that people are responding to.

00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:22.441 align:middle line:84%
So -- and I think that's
even more important

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.543 align:middle line:84%
than how somebody's
dressed, you know,

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:26.778 align:middle line:84%
if they're wearing
the right suit.

00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:30.716 align:middle line:84%
I, years and years ago,
worked in public relations

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.585 align:middle line:84%
and corporate social
responsibility,

00:17:32.585 --> 00:17:34.854 align:middle line:84%
and there was one
young man who started

00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:37.022 align:middle line:84%
out from the -- from
the inner city.

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:39.658 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have any decent
clothes, no decent shoes.

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:42.528 align:middle line:84%
He started, and within two
years I watched him fly up...

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:45.097 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...to an account
executive position you know.

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:45.998 align:middle line:90%
But it was his...

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.399 align:middle line:90%
He was positive, yeah.

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:50.302 align:middle line:84%
He was positive, but not just
in his smiles and his attitude.

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:54.306 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. You could literally feel
the energy coming off that guy,

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:55.141 align:middle line:90%
and you wanted to help him.

00:17:55.141 --> 00:17:56.142 align:middle line:90%
Sure. You wanted to help him.

00:17:56.142 --> 00:17:57.343 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:57.343 --> 00:17:59.145 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have the
brain power to get there.

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:00.212 align:middle line:90%
I mean... Yes, you do.

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:90%
...nothing just happens.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.185 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if -- if you are in the
right place at the right time

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:09.588 align:middle line:84%
but you're not prepared for
it you're going to fall.

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:13.392 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. Well, and I don't
quite go along with the ideas

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:16.195 align:middle line:84%
about all the positive-thinking,
you know groupies,

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:18.397 align:middle line:84%
that you just have to
think to make it happen.

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:19.832 align:middle line:90%
You know think and grow rich.

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.935 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. I mean, I can sit at
home and think and eat bonbons,

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.036 align:middle line:84%
and ain't nothing
going to happen

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:25.337 align:middle line:90%
for me, either [laughter].

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you know it doesn't mean
Reader's Digest Publishing

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.409 align:middle line:84%
Company's going to show
up on my doorstep just

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:31.777 align:middle line:90%
because I'm trying to...

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:35.114 align:middle line:84%
You wish. ...program my subtle
energy to make that happen.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:38.684 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, there's other
factors because subtle energy is

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:41.086 align:middle line:90%
in our soul; it's in our heart.

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:44.156 align:middle line:84%
You know it's that
spirit part of us as well.

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:47.393 align:middle line:84%
You know so even if our mind is
saying, "I get that job," or,

00:18:47.393 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:84%
"I want to be paid that much per
year," there's other parts of us

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.232 align:middle line:90%
that kind of can outweigh and --

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.601 align:middle line:90%
and vote a little louder

00:18:55.601 --> 00:18:57.203 align:middle line:84%
than you know just
what we're thinking

00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:58.637 align:middle line:90%
about might be able to do, too.

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:00.773 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a question
for Cyndi Dale.

00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Who else has one?

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.975 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am?

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.076 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Cyndi.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.312 align:middle line:84%
Hello. I was wondering
if you know of a way

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:11.317 align:middle line:84%
that we can use our subtle
energy to affect our metabolism,

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.219 align:middle line:90%
to affect our physical energy,

00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:16.222 align:middle line:84%
and our weight control
or lack of?

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:17.723 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:21.093 align:middle line:84%
Subtle energy is probably
one of the best way to --

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:23.429 align:middle line:90%
to get into a weight issue.

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:24.663 align:middle line:90%
And for most people it means

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:25.898 align:middle line:84%
that they're carrying
too much weight.

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:28.167 align:middle line:84%
Don't we wish that it
was the opposite end?

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.235 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know inside

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:31.437 align:middle line:84%
of the body are what
are called chakras,

00:19:31.437 --> 00:19:33.572 align:middle line:84%
and some of them are right
around the body, too.

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:36.976 align:middle line:84%
Those are energy organs or
energy bodies that are able

00:19:36.976 --> 00:19:41.046 align:middle line:84%
to take physical energy and turn
them into the subtle energy,

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:44.416 align:middle line:84%
and subtle energy and turn
them into physical energy.

00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:46.619 align:middle line:84%
And usually when we
have weight issues it's

00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:51.223 align:middle line:84%
because one particular energy
center or chakra is really low

00:19:51.223 --> 00:19:53.993 align:middle line:84%
and not processing
enough subtle energy

00:19:53.993 --> 00:19:56.028 align:middle line:90%
so our metabolism goes low,

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:58.831 align:middle line:84%
and that's right
down in our hip area.

00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:02.101 align:middle line:84%
And so what we want to
do is focus on working

00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:05.504 align:middle line:84%
through any safety issues
we have, security issues

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:09.174 align:middle line:84%
that we have, tell ourselves
that we're safe; we're secure

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:13.212 align:middle line:84%
because oftentimes weight is a
way to stay energetically safe,

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:16.048 align:middle line:84%
is to keep us from taking
on other people's energies,

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:20.552 align:middle line:84%
their feelings, their
thoughts, their needs.

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.888 align:middle line:84%
You know most people who hold a
little weight are really great

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:23.789 align:middle line:90%
codependents [laughter].

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:26.859 align:middle line:90%
And we're energy codependents.

00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:30.963 align:middle line:84%
We just take on those feelings;
we take on people's needs.

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:34.133 align:middle line:84%
You know -- and so our
metabolism is working

00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:37.469 align:middle line:84%
to help other people
rather than ourselves.

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:39.838 align:middle line:90%
And so -- get what I'm saying?

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:42.408 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. And so saying,
"I get to be safe.

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:43.642 align:middle line:90%
I get to be secure,"

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:45.711 align:middle line:84%
and to start telling
ourselves you know,

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:47.947 align:middle line:84%
"I get to use my
energy for myself.

00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to use my energy
to help and fix everybody else."

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.255 align:middle line:84%
That's probably 70% of it
right there, right there.

00:20:56.255 --> 00:21:00.025 align:middle line:84%
And the physical component is
that that energy center relates

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:03.462 align:middle line:84%
to the adrenals, so we do
a little bit of the subtle

00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:05.731 align:middle line:84%
and we do a little
bit of the physical.

00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:10.002 align:middle line:84%
And so to help our adrenals by
walking, exercising, you know,

00:21:10.002 --> 00:21:11.103 align:middle line:90%
and paying attention

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.239 align:middle line:84%
to our stress levels
is also really helpful.

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:16.842 align:middle line:84%
But just the adrenals alone
that's not going to fix it...

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:19.411 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...if we're still taking
on other people's energies.

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.814 align:middle line:84%
So just decide you're
not going to do that.

00:21:21.814 --> 00:21:22.314 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:23.716 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:26.085 align:middle line:84%
Cyndi, around Easter we did a
show on the Shroud of Turin...

00:21:26.085 --> 00:21:26.952 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:29.021 align:middle line:84%
...about this incredible
cloth...

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:31.857 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...that could very
well show the imprinted body

00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:32.991 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus.

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:34.093 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like they're
going that way with it.

00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:37.129 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like it's
also energy, right?

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:41.433 align:middle line:84%
Does the body have that
ability to just burst like that?

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:42.735 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely does.

00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:44.036 align:middle line:90%
It can imprint.

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:47.473 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably coming
from what I just introduced,

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:48.607 align:middle line:90%
the ideas of those chakras...

00:21:48.607 --> 00:21:51.377 align:middle line:84%
Right. Those lower
chakras are very physical.

00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:52.378 align:middle line:90%
They're not just psychic

00:21:52.378 --> 00:21:54.046 align:middle line:84%
and woo-woo [phonetic]
and out there.

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:57.416 align:middle line:84%
They're actually also
processing physical energy.

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible when somebody
really gets those activated

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.157 align:middle line:84%
that literally physical energy
-- it's electrical energy...

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.159 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...just kind
of discharges.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.628 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's
what's behind somebody

00:22:09.628 --> 00:22:10.829 align:middle line:90%
when they're upset.

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:13.432 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, "Hey,
I blow out lights.

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:15.034 align:middle line:84%
You know the overhead
lights go out."

00:22:15.034 --> 00:22:16.168 align:middle line:90%
My oldest son does that.

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:18.036 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Whenever he's
mad I stay away.

00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:18.837 align:middle line:90%
Or streetlights.

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:20.239 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Or streetlights.

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:21.874 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I stay away because there
go the light bulbs, all right?

00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:23.142 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Or things...

00:22:23.142 --> 00:22:23.675 align:middle line:90%
I've done that.

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.078 align:middle line:90%
Or something just falls over.

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:27.946 align:middle line:84%
You know it's like
the lamp falls over,

00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:29.448 align:middle line:90%
or whatever that might be.

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:31.417 align:middle line:84%
Some people might think
that's spirits, but if --

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:35.187 align:middle line:84%
if it's us and we're really
excited or really upset,

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:84%
that's our electrical
energy discharging.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.425 align:middle line:84%
Right. Tell us about
these points,

00:22:39.425 --> 00:22:40.959 align:middle line:90%
these chakra points in the body.

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:42.327 align:middle line:90%
Where exactly are they?

00:22:42.327 --> 00:22:44.897 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a number of them,
and there's always of course

00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:46.532 align:middle line:90%
in any field a big argument

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:48.901 align:middle line:84%
about how many there
are and where they are.

00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:50.202 align:middle line:90%
I say there's 12.

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:52.838 align:middle line:84%
Some people say there's
nine; some seven.

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Okay. All right, doesn't
make any difference.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.808 align:middle line:84%
You know there are
whatever there are.

00:22:55.808 --> 00:22:57.876 align:middle line:84%
Right. And we're just continuing
to unfold that information.

00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:58.877 align:middle line:90%
And they're everywhere?

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.012 align:middle line:90%
Well... Can you point to...

00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:00.946 align:middle line:90%
I can point.

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:01.647 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:01.647 --> 00:23:02.848 align:middle line:90%
So the basic ones are --

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:05.317 align:middle line:84%
the first chakra's in
the hip area right there.

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:09.054 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And that controls
physical activity.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.556 align:middle line:90%
The second is in the abdomen,

00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:12.124 align:middle line:84%
and that has to do
with emotions.

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:13.459 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:13.459 --> 00:23:15.394 align:middle line:84%
The third is in the solar
plexus, and that has to do with,

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:17.963 align:middle line:84%
well obviously digestion,
but will power.

00:23:17.963 --> 00:23:18.964 align:middle line:90%
The fourth is the heart...

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:20.632 align:middle line:84%
Okay. ...which is
love and healing.

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:23.102 align:middle line:84%
The fifth is in the
communication center

00:23:23.102 --> 00:23:26.839 align:middle line:84%
in the throat where we
obviously speak but also hear...

00:23:26.839 --> 00:23:28.507 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...you know what
it is that's inaudible

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:29.875 align:middle line:90%
to other people.

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:33.212 align:middle line:84%
The sixth chakra is in the
forehead, and that's the place

00:23:33.212 --> 00:23:36.648 align:middle line:84%
of what they call clairvoyance,
or getting visions or pictures.

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:37.983 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:40.252 align:middle line:84%
And the seventh is on the top
of the head, which is kind

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:42.020 align:middle line:90%
of that opening into spirit.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.757 align:middle line:84%
And in my book [chuckle], or my
books, there are several others.

00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:47.192 align:middle line:84%
There's one right
on top of the head.

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Okay. Through which the mystics

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.331 align:middle line:84%
or the shamans go visit
other dimensions and places.

00:23:52.331 --> 00:23:54.466 align:middle line:90%
There's one way above the head,

00:23:54.466 --> 00:23:56.602 align:middle line:84%
which is actually really
universal and ties us together.

00:23:56.602 --> 00:23:57.536 align:middle line:90%
Which is still part of us?

00:23:57.536 --> 00:23:58.537 align:middle line:90%
It is part of us.

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:00.005 align:middle line:84%
It's just not physically
attached to us?

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:03.475 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, because these
chakras aren't just in the body

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:06.512 align:middle line:84%
or around the body, though
they all locate somewhere

00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:08.413 align:middle line:90%
or attach into the body.

00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:13.185 align:middle line:84%
They open up into energy fields
that emanate from us, as well.

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're born with
these chakras?

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.688 align:middle line:90%
We are born with them.

00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:17.789 align:middle line:90%
We're born with them.

00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:20.459 align:middle line:84%
They activate at
different time periods.

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:23.061 align:middle line:84%
So -- so some of them
are kind of dormant...

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:25.631 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...when we're born
because we need, for instance,

00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:27.566 align:middle line:84%
the physical one
when we're born.

00:24:27.566 --> 00:24:29.268 align:middle line:84%
And then we open
up our emotions,

00:24:29.268 --> 00:24:32.104 align:middle line:84%
and at age four we
open up the mental one

00:24:32.104 --> 00:24:33.705 align:middle line:84%
where you know the
power struggles.

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:35.173 align:middle line:90%
Can you magnify them...

00:24:35.173 --> 00:24:36.008 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:36.008 --> 00:24:36.708 align:middle line:90%
...where they're even stronger?

00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:38.677 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:42.314 align:middle line:84%
And we need to most of the time,
because I think for most of us

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:45.183 align:middle line:84%
as we're growing up we
-- we're kind of dimmed.

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:46.985 align:middle line:84%
Our light is more
or less dimmed.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:48.587 align:middle line:84%
We're told not to
be so loud, or...

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:50.622 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...not to talk about
what we know, or don't talk

00:24:50.622 --> 00:24:53.559 align:middle line:84%
about that spirit on the
ceiling, or whatever it is.

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:55.327 align:middle line:90%
So usually by the time we go

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:58.096 align:middle line:84%
to adulthood we need
to magnify them.

00:24:58.096 --> 00:25:00.732 align:middle line:84%
If you're ill -- we'll
get into energy healing

00:25:00.732 --> 00:25:02.968 align:middle line:84%
in a second, but
if you're ill...

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:05.404 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...does something
happen to those chakras

00:25:05.404 --> 00:25:07.839 align:middle line:84%
in any specific spot
of the body?

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:09.541 align:middle line:90%
Well, absolutely.

00:25:09.541 --> 00:25:12.644 align:middle line:84%
You know if I have a chest
cold that chakra's going

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:14.446 align:middle line:84%
to be cloudy, the
one that's related

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.348 align:middle line:90%
to that part of the body.

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:19.551 align:middle line:84%
If I have a cough and you
could see my chakra...

00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:20.752 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. ...

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:21.587 align:middle line:84%
[clears throat] you're
going to see kind of a lot

00:25:21.587 --> 00:25:23.255 align:middle line:90%
of clouds in and around here.

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:25.023 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a bit
of an argument.

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:28.093 align:middle line:84%
Does the chakra go down
and then the body does?

00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:29.895 align:middle line:84%
Or does the body go down
and then the chakra?

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:30.729 align:middle line:90%
And pull the chakra down?

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:31.863 align:middle line:90%
And it really works both ways.

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:33.131 align:middle line:84%
It's the old chicken and
egg routine, isn't it?

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:36.134 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, because a lot of
healers actually can tell

00:25:36.134 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:84%
if somebody's going to get
sick because they're looking

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:43.075 align:middle line:84%
in the chakras intuitively or
maybe even using some devices

00:25:43.075 --> 00:25:45.877 align:middle line:84%
and checking what's happening
in the field, and they're going,

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:48.113 align:middle line:84%
"Hey, there's breast
cancer coming in," or,

00:25:48.113 --> 00:25:51.016 align:middle line:84%
"There's a smudge right here
aiming for your stomach;

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:52.884 align:middle line:90%
you may get the flu soon."

00:25:52.884 --> 00:25:56.054 align:middle line:84%
So we're very open-ended,
complex beings,

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:59.524 align:middle line:84%
and this subtle energy
tells us what might happen,

00:25:59.524 --> 00:26:03.929 align:middle line:84%
as well as what is happening, as
well as what did happen as well.

00:26:03.929 --> 00:26:07.199 align:middle line:84%
Now do people have the
ability to concentrate

00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:09.801 align:middle line:90%
on specific chakra regions...

00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:10.636 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:26:10.636 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:90%
...to fix?

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.071 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and a lot of meditators,

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:14.806 align:middle line:84%
that's what they're
doing you know.

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:17.109 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they -- usually
people who meditate --

00:26:17.109 --> 00:26:19.645 align:middle line:84%
which is very good for you,
the studies all show that --

00:26:19.645 --> 00:26:22.314 align:middle line:84%
they're usually really
focused on the top chakras

00:26:22.314 --> 00:26:24.116 align:middle line:84%
because they want a
spiritual experience.

00:26:24.116 --> 00:26:26.084 align:middle line:84%
Right. But let's say
you're not feeling well,

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:28.654 align:middle line:84%
or let's say you need money,
or let's say you're tired

00:26:28.654 --> 00:26:30.722 align:middle line:84%
of feeling somebody else's
feelings all the time.

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Or they're stressed out
to the max or something.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.891 align:middle line:90%
Well, there you go.

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.259 align:middle line:90%
I go lower in the body.

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:37.262 align:middle line:84%
Right. Because then you want
to go to the more physical part

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:84%
of you, and you want to ask
for additional subtle energy.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.336 align:middle line:84%
That's all healing is is,
"Hey, send me some good stuff."

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:45.437 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. Right?

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.439 align:middle line:84%
"Let me open to some
good energy that's going

00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:49.541 align:middle line:90%
to sweep out the bad energy."

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:50.676 align:middle line:90%
So we focus there.

00:26:50.676 --> 00:26:52.044 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you
another story.

00:26:52.044 --> 00:26:54.479 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I have no idea how this
happened, but you tell me...

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:55.147 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. ...what you think.

00:26:55.147 --> 00:26:56.515 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:26:56.515 --> 00:26:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Good old friend of mine in
St. Louis, name was Butch.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.352 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. Bartender.

00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:01.753 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. I seem to have a lot of
bartender stories [laughter].

00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:03.955 align:middle line:90%
Keep them going [laughter]!

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:04.856 align:middle line:90%
Those are spirits, too.

00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:05.991 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. I went in to -- went

00:27:05.991 --> 00:27:09.995 align:middle line:84%
in to see him one day,
and he went, "George!

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:12.931 align:middle line:84%
I've got about three
weeks left to live!"

00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:16.334 align:middle line:84%
He had cancer all over his
throat, and he's still working.

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:17.436 align:middle line:90%
He had to.

00:27:17.436 --> 00:27:19.304 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "What are
you talking about?"

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:22.908 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. And he said, "It's
-- it's going really fast,

00:27:22.908 --> 00:27:26.011 align:middle line:84%
and they gave me
about three weeks."

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:29.014 align:middle line:84%
Wow. I said, "Butch, is there
anything I can do for you?"

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:32.851 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "You're
always positive;

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:35.554 align:middle line:90%
you're always full of energy.

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:37.756 align:middle line:90%
Hug me; do something."

00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:38.824 align:middle line:90%
"Send me some."

00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:40.826 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. So I don't
know why I did this...

00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:42.394 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...but something
just possessed me...

00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:44.396 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So I said,
"Just come around here

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:45.630 align:middle line:90%
to the -- to the front here."

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.634 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So he came around from
the bar and, very frail,

00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:52.170 align:middle line:90%
and this was 10 years ago.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I gave him a hug, and
I touched his throat.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:00.245 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. I'm not a healer, but
I felt a burst of something...

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:02.681 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...coming
from me to him.

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as if I had stuck
my finger in an electric socket.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.056 align:middle line:90%
It was that kind of feeling.

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:13.325 align:middle line:90%
And he felt it, too.

00:28:13.325 --> 00:28:17.129 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Thanks."

00:28:17.129 --> 00:28:20.165 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And -- and he
went back to work.

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:22.334 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I went back
to Los Angeles.

00:28:22.334 --> 00:28:25.403 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And I assumed I'd
get a call in a few weeks

00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:26.438 align:middle line:90%
that our friend Butch...

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:27.806 align:middle line:90%
That there's a funeral.

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:28.907 align:middle line:90%
...had died.

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. I came back
about six months later,

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.847 align:middle line:84%
back to St. Louis,
Butch is still there.

00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:40.852 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "You're not going
to believe this, but it's gone."

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:42.654 align:middle line:90%
Amazing, beautiful.

00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:44.055 align:middle line:90%
I said, "What's gone?"

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:47.359 align:middle line:90%
He said, "The tumor is gone.

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:90%
You did that."

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.996 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Butch, I
didn't do anything."

00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:52.697 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "No, you did that."

00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:56.301 align:middle line:84%
Well, subsequently he was
a guest on  Coast to Coast

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:59.805 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about energy
healing, and this guy went

00:28:59.805 --> 00:29:04.309 align:middle line:84%
on the air and said that
his tumor was -- was gone.

00:29:04.309 --> 00:29:06.077 align:middle line:84%
He's still alive, by
the way, so it's now...

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:06.878 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:07.445 align:middle line:90%
...it's now about 12 years.

00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:08.647 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:12.651 align:middle line:84%
And -- and he said he's
convinced it was whatever

00:29:12.651 --> 00:29:15.887 align:middle line:84%
that burst of energy
was from me to him.

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Now, am I a healer?

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.993 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I am, but
something happened to him

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:26.231 align:middle line:84%
that day, and the
doctors are baffled.

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:30.202 align:middle line:84%
They gave him three weeks, and
he's now into his 12th year,

00:29:30.202 --> 00:29:32.437 align:middle line:90%
and he's still going strong.

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.306 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:29:34.306 --> 00:29:37.676 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe we could say we're
all healers, and include you

00:29:37.676 --> 00:29:41.213 align:middle line:84%
in the -- the group, in
the community of all of us

00:29:41.213 --> 00:29:43.014 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
made of subtle energy.

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:47.252 align:middle line:84%
We can all direct it, and we can
all program that subtle energy

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:90%
for what it is that we desire.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.556 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you did,
coming probably actually

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:54.359 align:middle line:84%
from your heart because when
you're hugging somebody that's

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:57.996 align:middle line:84%
your strongest energy
field, 5,000 times stronger

00:29:57.996 --> 00:30:00.732 align:middle line:84%
than the energy field that
emanates from the brain.

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:03.635 align:middle line:84%
You know your care, your
concern, your desire,

00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:06.771 align:middle line:84%
your love literally
programmed your subtle energy,

00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:11.243 align:middle line:84%
your electromagnetic energy to
go in there and to shift things.

00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:12.611 align:middle line:84%
And you know this
is -- this is why...

00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:13.979 align:middle line:90%
And it was fast.

00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:17.849 align:middle line:84%
It's fast, but this is why I
define subtle energy as energy

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:20.318 align:middle line:84%
that moves faster than
the speed of light.

00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:22.754 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2002 in a
research center

00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
in New Jersey there
was an experiment

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.992 align:middle line:90%
in which there was a chamber.

00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:29.394 align:middle line:84%
And the researchers
get this statement;

00:30:29.394 --> 00:30:33.098 align:middle line:84%
I think this is super cool, said
that this light, this particle

00:30:33.098 --> 00:30:36.334 align:middle line:84%
of light or part of a particle
of light, entered the chamber

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:40.305 align:middle line:84%
so fast it disappeared
before it entered.

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:42.674 align:middle line:84%
So with subtle energy
we don't have

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:45.844 align:middle line:84%
to obey the traffic
cops of the universe.

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:49.781 align:middle line:84%
I mean you potentially
energetically could have even

00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:54.185 align:middle line:84%
released the tumor at the
causal point of the tumor,

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:56.421 align:middle line:84%
so it could have been as
if he never had the tumor.

00:30:56.421 --> 00:30:57.889 align:middle line:84%
Without knowing what
I was doing you know.

00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:59.157 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to know.

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:01.359 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes we're better
off not getting too much

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:02.861 align:middle line:90%
in the way, to be really honest.

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:03.828 align:middle line:90%
Just let it happen?

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:05.764 align:middle line:84%
Just letting it happen,
just saying,

00:31:05.764 --> 00:31:07.699 align:middle line:84%
"What should be,
let's let it be."

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:11.603 align:middle line:84%
Because I do think 80% of most
problems are just other people's

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:13.672 align:middle line:90%
energy in the way or programs...

00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:14.806 align:middle line:90%
And do you think the --

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:17.342 align:middle line:84%
the energy that may have
come from me to him...

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:20.345 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...was like
chemotherapy or radiation?

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:21.346 align:middle line:90%
Completely.

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:22.480 align:middle line:84%
It literally attacked
the cancer cell?

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.383 align:middle line:84%
Completely, and it's --
and it radiated it out.

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:30.956 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, light or energy
is electromagnetic radiation,

00:31:30.956 --> 00:31:34.492 align:middle line:84%
so it's literally like
you radiated that out.

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:36.394 align:middle line:84%
And at some level he
must have been willing.

00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:38.129 align:middle line:84%
You know there has to
be a willing spirit...

00:31:38.129 --> 00:31:39.597 align:middle line:84%
Well he's the one
who generated it.

00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:40.165 align:middle line:90%
...somewhere inside.

00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:41.266 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Exactly.

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:42.334 align:middle line:84%
He generate -- and I
got to tell you, I mean,

00:31:42.334 --> 00:31:43.335 align:middle line:90%
I would not believe it...

00:31:43.335 --> 00:31:44.302 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:31:44.302 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:84%
...had somebody told
me that story...

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.272 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...but he's
a living example.

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:48.606 align:middle line:90%
He's a living example.

00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:50.175 align:middle line:90%
And it's that intention.

00:31:50.175 --> 00:31:52.811 align:middle line:84%
You know there's been a number
of researchers throughout time,

00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:55.513 align:middle line:84%
both scientific and
spiritual, that talk about,

00:31:55.513 --> 00:31:58.616 align:middle line:84%
"What is that amazing power,
and how does it work?"

00:31:58.616 --> 00:32:03.421 align:middle line:84%
And subtle energy is more the
scientific way to get to it.

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:06.458 align:middle line:84%
I like some of the researchers,
too, the more spiritual of them

00:32:06.458 --> 00:32:09.027 align:middle line:84%
who just call it grace,
just love in motion.

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:13.198 align:middle line:84%
Right. Love that's empowered,
that just -- it -- it hovers --

00:32:13.198 --> 00:32:16.101 align:middle line:84%
there was one particular healer,
Bruno Groening and a number

00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:18.603 align:middle line:84%
of others years and
years ago who said,

00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:20.271 align:middle line:90%
"You know it's always around us.

00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:22.674 align:middle line:84%
We just have to feel
worthy enough to let it in."

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.275 align:middle line:84%
We just have to feel
worthy enough.

00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:27.145 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we need someone
like you who cares about us

00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:31.082 align:middle line:84%
to help open up that trapdoor
and bring it in, as well.

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:33.685 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to
experiment with this.

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:35.053 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this sounds even
more [inaudible].

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:36.454 align:middle line:84%
Then it started getting
interesting...

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:37.188 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I bet.

00:32:37.188 --> 00:32:38.223 align:middle line:90%
...and -- and fun.

00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:39.491 align:middle line:90%
What'd you end up doing?

00:32:39.491 --> 00:32:44.763 align:middle line:84%
I had a fellow worker in
St. Louis who had a tumor

00:32:44.763 --> 00:32:47.098 align:middle line:90%
or a growth on her neck.

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, mm-hmm.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.603 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know if
it was malignant or not,

00:32:51.603 --> 00:32:53.238 align:middle line:90%
and I did the same thing.

00:32:53.238 --> 00:32:54.439 align:middle line:90%
You know...

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:56.107 align:middle line:84%
Wow! ...I -- and this time
it came from me to her.

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:57.642 align:middle line:90%
I said... Mm-hmm.

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:58.943 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Francine.

00:32:58.943 --> 00:33:00.011 align:middle line:90%
She's not with us anymore;

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:02.514 align:middle line:84%
she died of a heart
attack years later.

00:33:02.514 --> 00:33:06.551 align:middle line:84%
But she -- I said, "Let me
touch that, whatever it is."

00:33:06.551 --> 00:33:09.721 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. And she went,
"Well, okay."

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:12.123 align:middle line:84%
And you know so I
reached back here...

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:13.324 align:middle line:90%
Back there.

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:14.325 align:middle line:84%
...and just held onto it,
felt that burst again...

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:90%
My tumor's going, too.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:15.927 align:middle line:90%
...felt that.

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:16.828 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.797 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough, it was gone.

00:33:18.797 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.465 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:22.133 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if it was
ever cancerous, but...

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:22.901 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't matter.

00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:23.535 align:middle line:90%
...whatever it was...

00:33:23.535 --> 00:33:24.302 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:26.037 align:middle line:90%
...it was gone.

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:28.873 align:middle line:90%
Can you train people to do that?

00:33:28.873 --> 00:33:31.976 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have to
be born that way?

00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:34.446 align:middle line:84%
No, you can train
people, absolutely.

00:33:34.446 --> 00:33:37.749 align:middle line:84%
There is an author William
Bengston, very interesting man,

00:33:37.749 --> 00:33:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Ph.D., scientist, had a psychic
person show up in his life

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.155 align:middle line:84%
and teach him how
to do healing work,

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:45.723 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't really
buy into it.

00:33:45.723 --> 00:33:47.325 align:middle line:90%
But he -- people were healing.

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:50.462 align:middle line:84%
And he would just say energy --
basically, it's like energy in.

00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:52.897 align:middle line:84%
You know, let's just do the
right thing with this energy.

00:33:52.897 --> 00:33:55.867 align:middle line:84%
He took a number of
students from the university

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:58.803 align:middle line:84%
who did not believe
in subtle healing...

00:33:58.803 --> 00:34:00.972 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...did not want
anything to do with it,

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:04.008 align:middle line:84%
and he trained them to do it
even though they didn't believe

00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:05.143 align:middle line:90%
that it was possible.

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:06.244 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was a
bunch of hooey, right?

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:07.311 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was a
bunch of hooey, yep.

00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:09.681 align:middle line:84%
And they were still
able to do it, yeah.

00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:13.651 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it really is this
knowing we can do it will open

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:14.953 align:middle line:90%
up those faculties.

00:34:14.953 --> 00:34:18.289 align:middle line:84%
I think some people, to your
point, are born more open,

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:20.224 align:middle line:84%
more willing, with
different gifts.

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:20.992 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's genetic.

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:22.193 align:middle line:90%
It could be genetic.

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:24.329 align:middle line:84%
You know maybe my mother
or my grandmother had it.

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:25.463 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:28.266 align:middle line:84%
Do you know in my family
my dad's mom saw ghosts

00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:29.634 align:middle line:90%
and talked about them.

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:32.070 align:middle line:84%
She could see them, didn't like
houses where they hung out.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.505 align:middle line:84%
Right. Wouldn't let her
husband buy those houses.

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:37.909 align:middle line:84%
They thought she was a little
cracked, but well here it shows

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.577 align:middle line:90%
up two generations later.

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:42.847 align:middle line:84%
And there's families where the
healing power is passed down,

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:44.549 align:middle line:90%
and it becomes a calling.

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:46.751 align:middle line:84%
But we all have these
capacities.

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.219 align:middle line:84%
I think -- I think
sometimes, George,

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.922 align:middle line:84%
the question is what do
we feel more called to do?

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.857 align:middle line:84%
You know is it to do
that or do accounting?

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:55.693 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, for someone
like me who can't even keep,

00:34:55.693 --> 00:34:57.061 align:middle line:90%
right, like a tally...

00:34:57.061 --> 00:34:57.996 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm [laughter].

00:34:57.996 --> 00:34:59.464 align:middle line:84%
...hiring an accounting
person is

00:34:59.464 --> 00:35:01.533 align:middle line:84%
like a very healing
proposition, too.

00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:04.035 align:middle line:84%
So... Oh, I -- I always have
accountants [laughter] do

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:05.436 align:middle line:90%
my taxes.

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:06.838 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. You know I'm not going
to fool around with that stuff.

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:08.206 align:middle line:90%
Oh, me, either.

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:09.607 align:middle line:84%
Huh-uh. I just give them the
material and say, "Have at it."

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:11.643 align:middle line:84%
But we all have these chakras;
we all have these energy fields.

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:15.813 align:middle line:84%
So we all have the capacity to
open them for ourselves, and --

00:35:15.813 --> 00:35:17.849 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I think then
a sensing to want to give

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:20.351 align:middle line:84%
to others, to want to
help others, as well.

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:21.986 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should fire my
accountant [laughter].

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:23.321 align:middle line:90%
I'm always paying every year.

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:24.689 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:26.958 align:middle line:84%
We -- we don't know how much
they do save us, though, do we?

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.092 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't.

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:29.794 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.529 align:middle line:84%
Do you know it was
more of a quest.

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:34.732 align:middle line:84%
I did not have a career goal
of being an energy healer

00:35:34.732 --> 00:35:36.801 align:middle line:90%
or an author of energy books.

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.971 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to run businesses
and write books,

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:41.239 align:middle line:90%
but I was thinking more stories.

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Which you've done.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] I have done, just
in a whole different area.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.613 align:middle line:84%
But you know I did come out of
childhood with this question,

00:35:48.613 --> 00:35:50.515 align:middle line:90%
"What the heck am I doing?

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:52.650 align:middle line:84%
How come I can see
colors around people?

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.720 align:middle line:84%
How come my hands heat up when
somebody around me is sick?"

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.755 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. "How come I
can hear spirits?

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:59.591 align:middle line:90%
How come other people can't?"

00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:00.858 align:middle line:90%
You know and honest to gosh,

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:03.294 align:middle line:84%
growing up in the Lutheran
system you don't get a lot

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:04.195 align:middle line:90%
of answers.

00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:05.530 align:middle line:90%
You know except for this...

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.664 align:middle line:90%
Right. Kind of like...

00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:07.665 align:middle line:84%
Well, you probably don't
get a lot of answers...

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:08.866 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. ...in most religions.

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:10.335 align:middle line:90%
Do you? I don't think you do.

00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:14.672 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a little -- maybe Hindu,
maybe some of the indigenous...

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:15.673 align:middle line:90%
They don't understand it.

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.008 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
it, and it's --

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.877 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of hidden knowledge
inside of most religions.

00:36:19.877 --> 00:36:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So this little girl,
Cyndi Dale...

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.416 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. You're picking up on this,
and then you just carried it

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:26.684 align:middle line:90%
through with you, or what?

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I carried it through -- well,
I actually shut it down,

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.955 align:middle line:90%
to be honest, when I was 12.

00:36:30.955 --> 00:36:33.157 align:middle line:84%
I decided I didn't want
to have anything to do

00:36:33.157 --> 00:36:36.561 align:middle line:84%
with this world anymore,
and I'm a little stubborn.

00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So I honest to gosh told my
parents, "I'm out of here.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.598 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to die."

00:36:40.598 --> 00:36:42.066 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course like
what does that mean?

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:90%
At 12 years old?

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.069 align:middle line:90%
At 12. Isn't that kind of odd?

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.904 align:middle line:90%
I just said, I'm done.

00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:47.305 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:50.475 align:middle line:84%
And I got very sick
and kept losing weight.

00:36:50.475 --> 00:36:52.143 align:middle line:90%
They just thought I had the flu.

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:53.344 align:middle line:90%
Hmm. Within two or three days,

00:36:53.344 --> 00:36:56.014 align:middle line:84%
and I literally remember
leaving my body...

00:36:56.014 --> 00:36:57.548 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...and saying,
"I did it [laughter].

00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:59.317 align:middle line:90%
I got rid of it.

00:36:59.317 --> 00:37:00.718 align:middle line:90%
I made it."

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know I didn't see any
great -- great big white light.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.089 align:middle line:84%
The angels didn't come
with their trumpets.

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:06.524 align:middle line:90%
All I heard was a voice.

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking down at my
body; I'm starting to leave,

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and this voice says, "You
haven't done anything yet."

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.232 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, I don't
really think I need to.

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:15.967 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm -- I'm
-- I feel done."

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.869 align:middle line:84%
You were 12 going
on 30, weren't you?

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:18.803 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a little bit.

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:20.538 align:middle line:84%
And it said, "You
got to go back."

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:22.106 align:middle line:84%
I said, "I don't
want to go back."

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:26.077 align:middle line:84%
And it said, "You got to go
back," and smushed, there I was.

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, before then I was
very creative, very intuitive.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.983 align:middle line:90%
I closed it down I was so mad.

00:37:31.983 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And then it started opening
because I went to therapy.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.056 align:middle line:84%
Okay. At about 19
it started opening.

00:37:38.056 --> 00:37:39.157 align:middle line:90%
And then it came back?

00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:40.892 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I heard voices;
I did this and that,

00:37:40.892 --> 00:37:44.228 align:middle line:84%
and I was very fortunate to have
a therapist who looked at me

00:37:44.228 --> 00:37:46.864 align:middle line:84%
and didn't say I
was just crazy...

00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:47.965 align:middle line:90%
Right. ...right?

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:49.934 align:middle line:84%
Right. She said, "I
think you're psychic.

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.736 align:middle line:84%
You're not -- you're
not just OCD" --

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:53.304 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is they...

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:55.139 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...told me I
was, "You're psychic."

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:57.508 align:middle line:84%
And so then I wanted to
find out what it was,

00:37:57.508 --> 00:38:00.078 align:middle line:84%
and as I journeyed
-- I traveled a lot.

00:38:00.078 --> 00:38:03.047 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate to travel
to a lot of other countries.

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:05.917 align:middle line:84%
I sought out healers;
I sought out psychics.

00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:07.318 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to learn, like...

00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:08.920 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't have enough, right?

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.555 align:middle line:90%
I -- I just drank it in.

00:38:10.555 --> 00:38:14.792 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to meet the people in
their countries who did this,

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:17.562 align:middle line:84%
you know, who could hold a stone
and say, "Oh, there's a spirit

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:20.598 align:middle line:84%
in there," or who could touch
people and do the healing work,

00:38:20.598 --> 00:38:22.734 align:middle line:84%
or you know who grew
the plants...

00:38:22.734 --> 00:38:23.935 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...the medicinal
plants...

00:38:23.935 --> 00:38:25.703 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...and knew
what they were saying,

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:26.838 align:middle line:84%
and what it is that
they could do.

00:38:26.838 --> 00:38:29.540 align:middle line:90%
So I spent decades just --

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.075 align:middle line:84%
just doing whatever I
could do to go to learn.

00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you glad you came back...

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.277 align:middle line:90%
I am glad I came back.

00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:34.278 align:middle line:90%
...from your disagreement?

00:38:34.278 --> 00:38:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.181 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I am.

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So someone up there knew what
he was doing, even if I didn't.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.685 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know...

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:41.986 align:middle line:84%
Which is probably the
case most of the time.

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:44.288 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people
who are beginning to believe

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:46.924 align:middle line:84%
that the body is
electric, and that this...

00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:50.361 align:middle line:84%
Yes. ...energy that
surrounds it is there;

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:52.430 align:middle line:90%
it's real; that we tap into it.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And -- and I think
people like you, Cyndi,

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.902 align:middle line:90%
have had this innate ability...

00:38:57.902 --> 00:38:59.303 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. ...to utilize that.

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.671 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. And to run with it.

00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of young people do.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.676 align:middle line:84%
You know I think that they
learn sometimes to not talk

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.712 align:middle line:90%
about it or to turn it off.

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:11.416 align:middle line:84%
I actually even remember being
in my mom's womb and being able

00:39:11.416 --> 00:39:14.218 align:middle line:84%
to see the sound
waves that came in,

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:16.154 align:middle line:90%
just see them literally come in.

00:39:16.154 --> 00:39:17.989 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think I'm unusual.

00:39:17.989 --> 00:39:21.058 align:middle line:84%
I think it's unusual that I'm
here talking about it, you know,

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:22.293 align:middle line:84%
but I think a lot of
people have those...

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:23.461 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was destiny
you know it?

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:24.195 align:middle line:90%
...kind of experiences.

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.029 align:middle line:90%
I can remember back...

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:25.863 align:middle line:90%
You got to give a lot to that.

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:27.065 align:middle line:90%
...when I was 18 months old...

00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:28.866 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...that's as far
back as I remember, but...

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:29.567 align:middle line:90%
That's still young.

00:39:29.567 --> 00:39:31.135 align:middle line:90%
...not from the womb.

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.970 align:middle line:84%
That would have been
a trip, I think.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.305 align:middle line:90%
It was odd.

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.308 align:middle line:84%
Kind of waking up and
seeing sound hit you.

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:39.911 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to broadcast from
Mom's womb [laughter], hmm.

00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:42.213 align:middle line:84%
Explain what it is,
what's going on.

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:43.314 align:middle line:90%
That's your next show, isn't it?

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:44.315 align:middle line:90%
That's right [laughter].

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:45.683 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
for Cyndi.

00:39:45.683 --> 00:39:47.151 align:middle line:90%
Just raise your hands.

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:49.087 align:middle line:90%
Yes, way in the back here.

00:39:49.087 --> 00:39:53.858 align:middle line:84%
These energies, do you think
they can malfunction maybe

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:57.628 align:middle line:84%
somehow related to
spontaneous human combustion?

00:39:57.628 --> 00:40:00.731 align:middle line:90%
I love that question,

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:03.401 align:middle line:84%
and I thought George was going
there a little bit before.

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:04.735 align:middle line:90%
I do think it's possible.

00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:06.771 align:middle line:84%
I've actually done
a little research

00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:09.807 align:middle line:84%
on spontaneous combustion
through the centuries and,

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:13.344 align:middle line:84%
you know, and there is a lot of
evidence, even if it's anecdotal

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:15.746 align:middle line:84%
that people have
been able to do that.

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:18.816 align:middle line:84%
So I think it can
get that extreme.

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:22.687 align:middle line:84%
I think we're so, frankly as a
culture right now, out of touch

00:40:22.687 --> 00:40:25.990 align:middle line:84%
with that subtle energy
and with the power of it

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.559 align:middle line:84%
and how we can direct it that I
don't think it's going to happen

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:31.395 align:middle line:84%
for many people anytime
soon [laughter].

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:35.299 align:middle line:84%
And I think when it -- it occurs
that way is because there's

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:37.235 align:middle line:90%
so much emotional upset --

00:40:37.235 --> 00:40:41.072 align:middle line:84%
it's because there's so much
agony inside of somebody that --

00:40:41.072 --> 00:40:45.576 align:middle line:84%
that that's been, I think,
the -- the result of it.

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:46.978 align:middle line:90%
But the...

00:40:46.978 --> 00:40:49.013 align:middle line:84%
Hmm. ...the other side of that,
we can tip it over, you know,

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:52.049 align:middle line:84%
and talk about how what if
we could harness that kind

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:55.520 align:middle line:84%
of power inside of us and
blast out a tumor, right?

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.454 align:middle line:90%
Or get rid of...

00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:57.788 align:middle line:90%
Remember the movie  Carrie ?

00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:59.924 align:middle line:84%
Yes. She had that
kind of energy.

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:01.359 align:middle line:90%
She had that, absolutely.

00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:02.827 align:middle line:90%
So we all have it.

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:05.897 align:middle line:84%
You know in different cultures
it's called kundalini, or --

00:41:05.897 --> 00:41:08.933 align:middle line:84%
or life energy, or chi,
or whatever, prana...

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:10.535 align:middle line:90%
Right. ...word we want to use.

00:41:10.535 --> 00:41:14.005 align:middle line:84%
But what if we really could be
that open to it and focus it

00:41:14.005 --> 00:41:17.308 align:middle line:84%
in a good way, even if
it's to be creative?

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:20.311 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's important; as you
say focus it in a good way.

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:21.279 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm, exactly.

00:41:21.279 --> 00:41:23.347 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
might abuse it.

00:41:23.347 --> 00:41:24.448 align:middle line:90%
They can abuse it.

00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:26.117 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And again, often
without knowing it.

00:41:26.117 --> 00:41:28.586 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. So I think a lot
of times people use it

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:31.889 align:middle line:84%
and do a little bit of
brainwashing with it, actually.

00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:35.726 align:middle line:84%
You know because our thoughts
actually contain information,

00:41:35.726 --> 00:41:38.396 align:middle line:84%
you know, and so it is
possible for people to kind

00:41:38.396 --> 00:41:41.098 align:middle line:84%
of move their thoughts
around someone else.

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:44.168 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we only have to go back
to one of the worst examples,

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I think, across history
and Hitler.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.639 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's probably a
little-known fact he actually

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:51.876 align:middle line:84%
had an entity attached
to him he got when he was

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:54.412 align:middle line:84%
in the barracks during
World War I,

00:41:54.412 --> 00:41:56.480 align:middle line:84%
that he actually
heard a voice say

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.149 align:middle line:90%
to him, "Get out of the way."

00:41:58.149 --> 00:41:59.483 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. And boom.

00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. You know everybody
else was killed, and he wasn't.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.523 align:middle line:84%
So he misused that energy
and was able to really kind

00:42:05.523 --> 00:42:09.260 align:middle line:84%
of brainwash people to following
his ideas because he was able

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:12.630 align:middle line:84%
to so substantiate that
-- that subtle energy.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:13.798 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to one

00:42:13.798 --> 00:42:17.835 align:middle line:84%
of our long-distance
questions for Cyndi Dale.

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:19.237 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Cyndi.

00:42:19.237 --> 00:42:21.205 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jeff from Chicago, and I was
wondering why the subtle body is

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:24.408 align:middle line:84%
important to understand
in regular, daily life.

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:26.377 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that an important
question?

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:28.846 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really not just
about doing these really big

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:30.881 align:middle line:84%
and important things,
or impressing people,

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:32.550 align:middle line:90%
or making a lot of money.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.218 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're here
to live our lives.

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:35.886 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm here
to go to a lot

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:38.422 align:middle line:84%
of 14-year-old baseball
[laughter], to be honest.

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:39.890 align:middle line:90%
Lots of baseball.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.227 align:middle line:84%
Lots of baseball, two teams,
and football, you know.

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:46.097 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the most
beautiful application

00:42:46.097 --> 00:42:48.466 align:middle line:84%
of subtle energy is
for the everyday.

00:42:48.466 --> 00:42:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It's how we get up
in the morning

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.103 align:middle line:84%
and greet the world you
know, and say to ourselves,

00:42:52.103 --> 00:42:54.038 align:middle line:84%
"You know I'm going to
be in a positive place.

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see
things with gratitude.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.208 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take what comes.

00:42:57.208 --> 00:43:00.077 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use my subtle
energy to get guidance."

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:03.147 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. You know, if I need to
open to guidance, you know what

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:05.383 align:middle line:84%
to do, how to handle
situations that come up,

00:43:05.383 --> 00:43:08.552 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use it to
keep myself calm if people

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:11.422 align:middle line:84%
around me are frustrated
or frustrating me.

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:14.191 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I can be that peaceful
person in a business meeting.

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:17.628 align:middle line:84%
Sure. You know, which
is infectious as well.

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:20.698 align:middle line:84%
Or you know sometimes it's --
it's even more bold than that.

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:24.435 align:middle line:84%
I remember not too many years
ago my son Gabriel had a paper

00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:26.871 align:middle line:84%
route, which meant
Mom had a paper route.

00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And I hired help as often as
I could which meant we were

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.009 align:middle line:84%
in the hole on the
paper route income...

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:33.044 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...every single
week [laughter].

00:43:33.044 --> 00:43:34.478 align:middle line:84%
Using money on your
old business, huh?

00:43:34.478 --> 00:43:35.246 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:43:35.246 --> 00:43:36.614 align:middle line:90%
But it kept Gabriel busy.

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:40.051 align:middle line:84%
It kept Gabriel busy, and one
time we were just about both

00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:41.319 align:middle line:90%
of us to cross the street.

00:43:41.319 --> 00:43:43.721 align:middle line:84%
I was on one side,
and he was on another,

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:47.258 align:middle line:84%
and I heard this voice really
loudly saying, "Stop him."

00:43:47.258 --> 00:43:50.061 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I couldn't
have missed this voice.

00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:53.064 align:middle line:84%
So I immediately
yelled to Gabe, "Stop.

00:43:53.064 --> 00:43:54.031 align:middle line:90%
Don't move."

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:55.399 align:middle line:90%
And a car...

00:43:55.399 --> 00:43:57.368 align:middle line:84%
Yep. ...barreled around the
side and would have clipped him.

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:57.935 align:middle line:90%
Would have got him.

00:43:57.935 --> 00:43:58.602 align:middle line:90%
Just like that.

00:43:58.602 --> 00:43:59.637 align:middle line:90%
Would have got him.

00:43:59.637 --> 00:44:00.771 align:middle line:84%
That's happened to
me many times, too.

00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:02.106 align:middle line:90%
There's that thing in us.

00:44:02.106 --> 00:44:03.441 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:06.010 align:middle line:84%
It -- it's all tied together,
the -- the subtle energy,

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.946 align:middle line:90%
the healing, the precognition,

00:44:08.946 --> 00:44:11.716 align:middle line:84%
the intuitiveness,
all this stuff.

00:44:11.716 --> 00:44:13.584 align:middle line:84%
It is. It's -- it's
all built in.

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:15.353 align:middle line:84%
Let's take another
question for Cyndi.

00:44:15.353 --> 00:44:18.823 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir? Hi, Cyndi.

00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:23.461 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask about the colors
that you would see in the auras.

00:44:23.461 --> 00:44:25.896 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of --
I hear people talk,

00:44:25.896 --> 00:44:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's the feelings you have
at the time, your emotions

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.635 align:middle line:84%
that can change and
direct the colors.

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.704 align:middle line:84%
But is it -- is there
colors that are --

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:36.674 align:middle line:84%
kind of show who we are
instead of who we are now?

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:38.309 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love that question.

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:39.443 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:41.378 align:middle line:90%
And as you're speaking, yes.

00:44:41.378 --> 00:44:43.614 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are a lot
of colors that shift.

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:45.249 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. So when I'm
angry I'm going

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.751 align:middle line:90%
to have more red around me.

00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:49.053 align:middle line:84%
Okay. If I'm in a more
spiritual place I'm going

00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:51.322 align:middle line:84%
to have a little bit
more white, or purple,

00:44:51.322 --> 00:44:54.458 align:middle line:84%
or some of those really
high-energy kind of colors.

00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:57.294 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe there
are fixed colors.

00:44:57.294 --> 00:45:00.364 align:middle line:84%
I call them the personality
colors or our spirit colors

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:01.866 align:middle line:90%
that just don't change.

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:04.301 align:middle line:84%
Now I kind of see them,
for those of us who do more

00:45:04.301 --> 00:45:05.970 align:middle line:84%
of the intuitive
work and want to...

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.738 align:middle line:90%
Sure. ...copy this, you know,

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.874 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit
outside of the body.

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:13.244 align:middle line:84%
They're not in a traditional
field or auric layer.

00:45:13.244 --> 00:45:15.079 align:middle line:90%
They're kind of in between them,

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:18.282 align:middle line:84%
and they're a little bit more
static than they are dynamic.

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:21.519 align:middle line:84%
And so those tell me who
that person really is.

00:45:21.519 --> 00:45:24.221 align:middle line:84%
It tells me their
spiritual qualities or gifts.

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:26.590 align:middle line:84%
If they're sick,
different color?

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.592 align:middle line:90%
No, no. If they're -- no.

00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:30.327 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
really changes is

00:45:30.327 --> 00:45:31.929 align:middle line:84%
if they haven't been
able to really use

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:35.699 align:middle line:84%
that gift it's a little lighter;
it's a little more tempered;

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:37.268 align:middle line:90%
it's not bold or vibrant.

00:45:37.268 --> 00:45:40.137 align:middle line:84%
Right. Because they haven't
come from that place, so --

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:41.472 align:middle line:90%
so let's just say, for instance,

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:43.073 align:middle line:84%
I look at three different
people,

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:45.776 align:middle line:84%
and they have three different
colors around their heart.

00:45:45.776 --> 00:45:49.246 align:middle line:84%
Now a normal psychic view would
be that we see green there.

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:52.049 align:middle line:84%
Okay. So let's say I see
somebody who has a lot of green

00:45:52.049 --> 00:45:54.018 align:middle line:90%
in this area around their heart.

00:45:54.018 --> 00:45:55.886 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, "You know
you're a natural healer,"

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:58.155 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
healing center.

00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:00.624 align:middle line:84%
But let's say somebody
has a lot of blue there.

00:46:00.624 --> 00:46:03.494 align:middle line:84%
I would say, "You know in
relationships you really need

00:46:03.494 --> 00:46:05.095 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand
somebody,"

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.730 align:middle line:84%
because blue's about
communication.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:10.267 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. I'd say, "You're an --
you're the understanding person.

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:13.237 align:middle line:84%
You're that person who always
has a good word for somebody.

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:14.605 align:middle line:90%
You know everything that's going

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.807 align:middle line:84%
on in other people's
relationships."

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:18.809 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there's a
lot of yellow there.

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:20.411 align:middle line:90%
I would -- which is kind of more

00:46:20.411 --> 00:46:22.480 align:middle line:84%
of an administrative
energy or color.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.248 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, "You love
accounting [laughter].

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:26.851 align:middle line:90%
That turns you on.

00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:28.919 align:middle line:84%
You like working
with information."

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:31.422 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a
whole different system,

00:46:31.422 --> 00:46:34.124 align:middle line:84%
and if people want to practice
it, it's really about asking

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:37.962 align:middle line:84%
to get a sense of other
people's permanent,

00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:40.931 align:middle line:84%
more spiritual personality
rather than the stuff

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that changes on a
day-to-day basis.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:46.370 align:middle line:84%
The late American prophet Edgar
Casey used to read auras...

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.406 align:middle line:84%
Yes. ...right around
people, and one day he was

00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:54.178 align:middle line:84%
in a high-rise building ready
to get on an old elevator,

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:56.513 align:middle line:84%
and he saw people
in the elevator.

00:46:56.513 --> 00:47:00.251 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in his life
he could not see any auras

00:47:00.251 --> 00:47:01.385 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:04.421 align:middle line:84%
Oh. And he -- scared --
it scared him so much...

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:05.089 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see it.

00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.890 align:middle line:90%
...he backed off.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:06.824 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, mm-hmm.

00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:08.459 align:middle line:90%
The elevator cable snapped.

00:47:08.459 --> 00:47:09.593 align:middle line:90%
Crashed. And they died.

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:12.329 align:middle line:90%
Yep, yep. Go figure.

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:15.566 align:middle line:84%
Wow. You know we have
one layer around us.

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:19.637 align:middle line:84%
A lot of esoteric people call
it the "etheric layer," and it's

00:47:19.637 --> 00:47:22.973 align:middle line:84%
around our body, but it's also
around what we call our soul,

00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:25.242 align:middle line:84%
which is the part of us
that moves from experience

00:47:25.242 --> 00:47:28.178 align:middle line:84%
to experience, and some
say lifetime to lifetime.

00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:29.713 align:middle line:90%
And when we're going to leave,

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:33.117 align:middle line:84%
that part of us takes
our colors you could say,

00:47:33.117 --> 00:47:36.887 align:middle line:84%
takes up our life energy,
our memories, and exits.

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:40.057 align:middle line:84%
It's like it takes a
suitcase of this life with it.

00:47:40.057 --> 00:47:43.294 align:middle line:84%
So my sense is that's
what he was perceiving is

00:47:43.294 --> 00:47:45.262 align:middle line:84%
that at some level they knew
what was going to happen,

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:47.197 align:middle line:84%
certainly not up
here, and not in a way

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that they could probably
have prevented it, you know,

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.702 align:middle line:84%
but that soul was
already exiting.

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:54.271 align:middle line:90%
So -- so those colors were gone.

00:47:54.271 --> 00:47:56.073 align:middle line:84%
You know the -- the immortal
self was already gone.

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:59.209 align:middle line:84%
In a moment Cyndi will
tell us about this pendulum

00:47:59.209 --> 00:48:01.578 align:middle line:84%
when we come right back
on  Beyond Belief .

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:08.919 align:middle line:90%
[ Applause ]

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:11.021 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back to  Beyond
Belief  with Cyndi Dale.

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:15.326 align:middle line:84%
Cyndi, what is this
huge lump of something?

00:48:15.326 --> 00:48:16.126 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a mega stone?

00:48:16.126 --> 00:48:17.127 align:middle line:90%
What is this thing?

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:17.795 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:48:17.795 --> 00:48:19.129 align:middle line:90%
It's heavy.

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:21.098 align:middle line:84%
I -- I hope I can't be sued
by some kind of stone police

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:22.733 align:middle line:84%
for telling you,
but I brought ...

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:24.134 align:middle line:90%
How did you get this here?

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:28.272 align:middle line:84%
I carried it in a backpack from
Avebury which is a sacred site

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:30.240 align:middle line:84%
over in England really
close to Stonehenge.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.711 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually kind of on
the outskirts of a sacred site.

00:48:33.711 --> 00:48:34.812 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to admit

00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:36.547 align:middle line:84%
to actually pilfering
from a sacred site.

00:48:36.547 --> 00:48:38.115 align:middle line:84%
They let you check
this on a plane?

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:39.516 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, isn't that amazing?

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:40.985 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my gosh, it's
-- it's really heavy.

00:48:40.985 --> 00:48:41.719 align:middle line:90%
It's really heavy.

00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:42.786 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.388 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know it's
actually fieldstone,

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:46.423 align:middle line:84%
but it's from the area
of the sacred sites,

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:49.393 align:middle line:84%
so it's really been whatever
word you want to use, infused

00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:52.529 align:middle line:84%
or imbibed with sacred
energy of thousands

00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:53.664 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:54.398 align:middle line:84%
Let me turn it around
so people can see it.

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:55.532 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it beautiful?

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:57.234 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty
amazing, to be honest.

00:48:57.234 --> 00:48:58.369 align:middle line:90%
What -- what does it do?

00:48:58.369 --> 00:48:59.803 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's part of a site

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:02.306 align:middle line:84%
that was actually used
for healing ritual.

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:05.909 align:middle line:84%
So Avebury had a number of
great big standing stones;

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:08.112 align:middle line:84%
it's near Stonehenge, so
kind of think Stonehenge,

00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:11.248 align:middle line:84%
but even bigger, using
some of the local rock,

00:49:11.248 --> 00:49:14.018 align:middle line:84%
and they did ritual,
healing work, etcetera,

00:49:14.018 --> 00:49:16.754 align:middle line:90%
within that stone site.

00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:18.889 align:middle line:84%
And it -- thousands
of years, you know,

00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:22.159 align:middle line:84%
because the ancients really
believed in subtle energy.

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:24.194 align:middle line:84%
Sure did. And healing was
done with subtle energy.

00:49:24.194 --> 00:49:25.529 align:middle line:84%
Right. They probably
knew more about it

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:26.263 align:middle line:90%
than we do today, you know?

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:27.464 align:middle line:90%
They know much more.

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:29.233 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you know I mean it'd
be really nice to kind

00:49:29.233 --> 00:49:30.734 align:middle line:84%
of speed dial back
there I think.

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:32.069 align:middle line:90%
So does this give off anything?

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:33.404 align:middle line:90%
It does give off energy.

00:49:33.404 --> 00:49:36.707 align:middle line:84%
I actually use it in my
office right next to people

00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:37.941 align:middle line:90%
who come in for healing work.

00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:40.577 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you
how many people go,

00:49:40.577 --> 00:49:42.913 align:middle line:84%
"There's something
odd-feeling near my foot,"

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:45.215 align:middle line:84%
because of course I don't
put it on the sofa near them.

00:49:45.215 --> 00:49:46.617 align:middle line:90%
And I say, "You know that's a --

00:49:46.617 --> 00:49:49.520 align:middle line:84%
that's a stone from
Avebury, from a sacred site."

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.321 align:middle line:84%
Amazing. Well, can you
imagine if this were

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:55.059 align:middle line:84%
from an eight-foot stone that
they might have chipped away?

00:49:55.059 --> 00:49:56.660 align:middle line:90%
I can barely lift this.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.662 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea how they
moved things back then.

00:49:58.662 --> 00:50:00.064 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it wild?

00:50:00.064 --> 00:50:02.266 align:middle line:84%
Well, and there's all kinds of
theories about that, and I --

00:50:02.266 --> 00:50:04.268 align:middle line:84%
I go back to subtle
energy, you know.

00:50:04.268 --> 00:50:06.437 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these days we
have the mag dev trains

00:50:06.437 --> 00:50:07.671 align:middle line:90%
which are magnetic.

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.273 align:middle line:84%
Right. You know and they're
not even on the ground,

00:50:09.273 --> 00:50:10.641 align:middle line:90%
and they're super bullet.

00:50:10.641 --> 00:50:13.477 align:middle line:84%
Yep. So why couldn't we have
used magnetism the same way...

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:14.244 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:14.812 align:middle line:90%
...thousands of years ago.

00:50:14.812 --> 00:50:15.379 align:middle line:90%
You know what...

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:16.146 align:middle line:90%
It's science.

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:17.281 align:middle line:90%
...Edward Lee Skullman...

00:50:17.281 --> 00:50:19.583 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...who developed
Coral Castle in Florida,

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:23.220 align:middle line:84%
a structure of buildings that
he moved by himself, I mean,

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.355 align:middle line:84%
blocks of stone bigger
than part of this...

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:28.125 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...studio,
said it was magnetism.

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:29.460 align:middle line:90%
It's magnetism.

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.595 align:middle line:84%
That -- that you don't have
to be metal to be magnetic.

00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:33.697 align:middle line:84%
Now this -- this is
a pendulum, right?

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:34.665 align:middle line:90%
This is a pendulum.

00:50:34.665 --> 00:50:35.899 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what you do with this.

00:50:35.899 --> 00:50:37.101 align:middle line:90%
Well, a pendulum...

00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:38.335 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
a demonstration and such.

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:40.404 align:middle line:84%
...is really just any object
on a chain or a string.

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:44.241 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a magical pendulum
just because it's really pretty,

00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:46.276 align:middle line:84%
but it is an object
that can be used

00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:50.013 align:middle line:84%
to measure the electromagnetic
or energetic flow of a chakra,

00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:51.615 align:middle line:90%
or an energetic field.

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:54.451 align:middle line:84%
Because you know this stuff
really is more scientific

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.787 align:middle line:84%
than it is kind of out
there or woo-woo [phonetic].

00:50:56.787 --> 00:51:00.124 align:middle line:84%
Right. So these chakras are
energetic bodies; they're made

00:51:00.124 --> 00:51:03.627 align:middle line:84%
out of EMF, or electromagnetic
energy or spectrum.

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:06.597 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. So are the energy
fields that come off of us.

00:51:06.597 --> 00:51:09.333 align:middle line:84%
So are what's called the
meridians, the energy fields

00:51:09.333 --> 00:51:11.201 align:middle line:90%
that flow inside of our body,

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:14.371 align:middle line:84%
and we just don't have all
the tools that we need now

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:16.673 align:middle line:84%
to take these pictures
or to measure them.

00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:20.711 align:middle line:84%
So a pendulum is kind of a --
an easy way to be able to look

00:51:20.711 --> 00:51:23.547 align:middle line:84%
at the electromagnetic
flow of a chakra,

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.249 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
going to do...

00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:26.250 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:27.417 align:middle line:84%
...is show people
they have chakras.

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:29.286 align:middle line:90%
Suzanne has volunteered.

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:32.689 align:middle line:90%
Suzanne, come on down.

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:34.024 align:middle line:90%
Here she is.

00:51:34.024 --> 00:51:35.659 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Suzanne.

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Hello. How are you?

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.362 align:middle line:90%
I'm well, thank you.

00:51:38.362 --> 00:51:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to see
if you have chakras.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.532 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Do you think
you've got them?

00:51:41.532 --> 00:51:42.299 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure I do.

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Everybody does.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.368 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure I do.

00:51:44.368 --> 00:51:47.004 align:middle line:84%
You know but we're open-ended
beings, and so our chakras,

00:51:47.004 --> 00:51:52.442 align:middle line:84%
and they expand into our energy
fields, respond to what's going

00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:55.979 align:middle line:84%
on around us, to how we feel,
you know to how -- what --

00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:59.349 align:middle line:84%
what we ate, you know to what
suggestions are being put

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:01.919 align:middle line:84%
into our minds, so we're going
to do a little experimenting.

00:52:01.919 --> 00:52:04.621 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Not just to show
that you have chakras,

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.790 align:middle line:90%
but to show how those respond

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:09.326 align:middle line:84%
to different kind
of ideas, as well.

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:12.262 align:middle line:84%
Now we went over some of
the main chakras that are

00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:14.398 align:middle line:84%
in the body and just around,
but we also have a lot

00:52:14.398 --> 00:52:16.867 align:middle line:84%
of secondary ones,
and some of those are

00:52:16.867 --> 00:52:18.936 align:middle line:90%
in our palm and our hands.

00:52:18.936 --> 00:52:21.371 align:middle line:84%
So I'd love it if you would
just reach your palm out.

00:52:21.371 --> 00:52:23.207 align:middle line:84%
There you go, and we
can put it right there.

00:52:23.207 --> 00:52:25.809 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to get a
measure of what's happening

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:29.746 align:middle line:84%
with that electromagnetic
frequency right now, all right?

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:34.851 align:middle line:84%
Now when a chakra's healthy
typically -- here we go --

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:40.290 align:middle line:84%
it moves from the point of view
of me in a clockwise position,

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.658 align:middle line:90%
and yours is doing it.

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Now you're getting a little
nervous because it's starting

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.329 align:middle line:90%
to shut down, isn't it?

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Like, "Am I doing it right?

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:47.364 align:middle line:90%
Am I doing it right?

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:48.599 align:middle line:84%
I promise I'm not
cheating [laugher].

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:50.334 align:middle line:90%
I'm not moving this thing."

00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So they can close down, and when
they're closed we don't pick

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.940 align:middle line:84%
up as much information;
we don't send out as much.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.543 align:middle line:84%
That's not bad; it
just means we're not

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:01.278 align:middle line:90%
as open at that moment.

00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:03.013 align:middle line:90%
We're not as much in the flow.

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.348 align:middle line:90%
So me just explaining

00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:06.550 align:middle line:84%
that you're opening
up your chakra again.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:07.784 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Isn't that nice?

00:53:07.784 --> 00:53:09.920 align:middle line:84%
But you're the one
doing the testing.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.954 align:middle line:90%
I'm holding it.

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:12.222 align:middle line:90%
Right? But you know what?

00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:14.191 align:middle line:90%
People can try this at home.

00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:15.692 align:middle line:84%
You know all those
commercials where they say...

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:16.827 align:middle line:90%
One of the few things...

00:53:16.827 --> 00:53:17.728 align:middle line:90%
...don't try this at home.

00:53:17.728 --> 00:53:18.829 align:middle line:90%
...you can do at home.

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:20.230 align:middle line:90%
You can do this at home.

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.066 align:middle line:84%
And if there's some kind of bond
between two people, you know,

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:25.836 align:middle line:84%
just if they just
trust each other,

00:53:25.836 --> 00:53:26.937 align:middle line:90%
this'll happen at home, too.

00:53:26.937 --> 00:53:28.906 align:middle line:84%
Now you can see that
it's moving all over,

00:53:28.906 --> 00:53:30.274 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not doing that.

00:53:30.274 --> 00:53:33.543 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we're going
to do another experiment.

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:36.046 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think a
happy, happy thought.

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.815 align:middle line:84%
Like think about your
-- do you have kids?

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:39.950 align:middle line:90%
I do. I have two daughters.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.686 align:middle line:84%
Okay, wow, you love your
daughters, don't you?

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. Look at that.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.521 align:middle line:90%
Look at it go.

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:45.422 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that happy?

00:53:45.422 --> 00:53:45.989 align:middle line:90%
You have to...

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:46.957 align:middle line:90%
It's like a...

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:47.758 align:middle line:84%
...show them how
much you love them.

00:53:47.758 --> 00:53:49.359 align:middle line:90%
It's like a merry-go-round.

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:50.193 align:middle line:90%
Okay. There you are.

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:52.863 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's proof right there.

00:53:52.863 --> 00:53:56.667 align:middle line:84%
Yep. All right, now think about
somebody you don't like as much.

00:53:56.667 --> 00:53:57.868 align:middle line:90%
Don't share who it is.

00:53:57.868 --> 00:53:58.969 align:middle line:84%
Okay. You don't want to
be on-air and share that.

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:00.304 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't.

00:54:00.304 --> 00:54:01.805 align:middle line:90%
All right, immediately.

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, wonder who that
is [laughter]?

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:07.311 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, do we really have
to wonder [laughter]?

00:54:07.311 --> 00:54:10.047 align:middle line:84%
See, and I'm actually even
feeling really hot while we talk

00:54:10.047 --> 00:54:11.381 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So a lot of times we
get our own physical reactions

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:14.618 align:middle line:90%
with somebody.

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:16.286 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. If we're able
to attune to them.

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:18.055 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm going
to do one more kind

00:54:18.055 --> 00:54:19.289 align:middle line:90%
of not nice thing to you.

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:22.326 align:middle line:84%
Okay. All right, I want
you to think of a really --

00:54:22.326 --> 00:54:25.562 align:middle line:84%
kind of really hateful
situation,

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:28.432 align:middle line:84%
something where you
really felt hurt.

00:54:28.432 --> 00:54:30.801 align:middle line:84%
That somebody betrayed her
or something like that?

00:54:30.801 --> 00:54:31.601 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:54:31.601 --> 00:54:32.502 align:middle line:90%
It would be more emotional.

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:35.439 align:middle line:90%
Mmm. You know, all right.

00:54:35.439 --> 00:54:37.407 align:middle line:84%
You can see that it
keeps you shut down.

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:39.776 align:middle line:84%
Yep. All right, now
we're going to experiment

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.478 align:middle line:90%
with a little healing.

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:42.546 align:middle line:90%
Okay. All right?

00:54:42.546 --> 00:54:44.481 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is
you call spirit,

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:47.384 align:middle line:84%
even your own higher spirit,
we're just going to ask

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:51.421 align:middle line:84%
for that situation, the emotions
of it, to be cleared for you.

00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:54.725 align:middle line:84%
Okay. See, and this is what
you were doing, George.

00:54:54.725 --> 00:54:58.328 align:middle line:84%
Yep. And now look
what's happening.

00:54:58.328 --> 00:55:01.465 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. It's actually
going counterclockwise

00:55:01.465 --> 00:55:05.402 align:middle line:84%
which is what happens
when we're clearing

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:07.671 align:middle line:90%
or releasing from a chakra.

00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:09.106 align:middle line:90%
You're kind of downwind of this.

00:55:09.106 --> 00:55:10.941 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. But it's all good energy

00:55:10.941 --> 00:55:12.642 align:middle line:84%
because we're bringing
in good energy.

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. How -- how are you
actually feeling right now?

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.647 align:middle line:90%
About that particular situation?

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.316 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. That it's -- yeah.

00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:20.250 align:middle line:90%
It's starting to resolve.

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:21.184 align:middle line:84%
I can consciously
let it go, yeah.

00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:22.853 align:middle line:90%
All right, all right.

00:55:22.853 --> 00:55:26.223 align:middle line:84%
So let's just play a little
bit with time and space.

00:55:26.223 --> 00:55:29.726 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And say that it's
completely gone now.

00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:31.194 align:middle line:90%
Not only have you healed it,

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:35.532 align:middle line:84%
but you've taken the proverbial
silver lining from it,

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:38.068 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately that's
what forgiveness is.

00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:41.405 align:middle line:84%
Right. It's just saying, "You
know, maybe I didn't cause this,

00:55:41.405 --> 00:55:43.874 align:middle line:84%
maybe I can't cure it, but
I can take what's good..."

00:55:43.874 --> 00:55:48.445 align:middle line:84%
Right. "...and what -- what
provides wisdom and glean that."

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And now look at how
you're shifting.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.681 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I want you
to keep in mind,

00:55:51.681 --> 00:55:52.849 align:middle line:84%
you are not moving
that on purpose.

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:53.784 align:middle line:90%
I'm not moving anything.

00:55:53.784 --> 00:55:54.785 align:middle line:90%
This is...

00:55:54.785 --> 00:55:55.786 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even actually
focused on it.

00:55:55.786 --> 00:55:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I'm more focused
on Suzanne...

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.156 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. ...than -- than the stone.

00:55:59.156 --> 00:56:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah.

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:01.625 align:middle line:90%
So how do you feel right now?

00:56:01.625 --> 00:56:02.959 align:middle line:84%
You can rest your
arm for a second.

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:04.227 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can feel that.

00:56:04.227 --> 00:56:05.529 align:middle line:84%
I can even feel it kind of
go up my arm a little bit.

00:56:05.529 --> 00:56:06.463 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:07.664 align:middle line:84%
Like I feel that
shift happen, so.

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:08.432 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:56:08.432 --> 00:56:09.933 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Because psychic

00:56:09.933 --> 00:56:12.035 align:middle line:84%
and physical are
really one and the same.

00:56:12.035 --> 00:56:15.405 align:middle line:84%
It's really just a
continuum of speed.

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:17.607 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. You know, when we heal
something in the subtle realm

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:20.410 align:middle line:84%
or even through suggestion,
you know, that gets locked

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.712 align:middle line:90%
into the physical body, as well.

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:26.082 align:middle line:84%
So it's very common when people
go through energy experiences,

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:29.586 align:middle line:84%
you know, to get hot, or cold,
or different kinds of reactions,

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:31.555 align:middle line:90%
or even emotions, you know.

00:56:31.555 --> 00:56:33.423 align:middle line:84%
And -- and the pendulum's
not doing the work.

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:35.258 align:middle line:90%
No. It's just a tool.

00:56:35.258 --> 00:56:37.794 align:middle line:84%
It's just showing
what is happening

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:41.064 align:middle line:84%
in your chakra that's then
being shared throughout the rest

00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:42.899 align:middle line:90%
of your system or body.

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:44.100 align:middle line:90%
And we have many chakras.

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.603 align:middle line:84%
We're just using a
minor one right there.

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:48.271 align:middle line:84%
So are you okay if
I test another one?

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Sure. All right, but
for this I'd like you

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.242 align:middle line:84%
to put your hands
more at your side.

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:55.145 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're going to
measure your stomach chakra.

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:56.413 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:56:56.413 --> 00:56:59.716 align:middle line:84%
Why? Well first of all
because it's easy for me to do

00:56:59.716 --> 00:57:01.685 align:middle line:84%
when she's sitting
down [laughter].

00:57:01.685 --> 00:57:06.122 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And second I'm going to
compare the solar plexus chakra

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:11.194 align:middle line:84%
with her heart because sometimes
we have different experiences

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:14.264 align:middle line:84%
in our chakras, so some are more
healthy sometimes than others...

00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:17.367 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...or more
turned on than others are.

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:19.202 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
see what's happening

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:21.471 align:middle line:84%
with that solar plexus
chakra right now.

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:22.772 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:26.710 align:middle line:84%
All right, see this one's
going just kind of vertical,

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.846 align:middle line:84%
and vertical tends to mean
that that energy center

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:32.816 align:middle line:84%
which is dealing with
information, with data,

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:36.586 align:middle line:84%
with administrative
procedures, with ideas,

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:40.156 align:middle line:84%
with that which affects
our self-esteem,

00:57:40.156 --> 00:57:42.158 align:middle line:84%
vertical actually means
that you're processing

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:44.594 align:middle line:84%
that spiritually right
now, which would make sense

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:46.696 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
about spiritual --

00:57:46.696 --> 00:57:48.498 align:middle line:90%
spiritual information.

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Right. And a spiritual
way to look at yourself.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.603 align:middle line:84%
Mmm. To really look at
yourself as an energy being,

00:57:53.603 --> 00:57:56.606 align:middle line:90%
that's what this is reflecting.

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:58.375 align:middle line:90%
All right, right.

00:57:58.375 --> 00:58:02.879 align:middle line:84%
Now if you think a little bit
more about everyday activities,

00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:04.614 align:middle line:84%
because this energy
center is a lot

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:08.451 align:middle line:84%
about everyday life
activities, details, lists,

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:09.953 align:middle line:90%
think about your lists.

00:58:09.953 --> 00:58:10.854 align:middle line:90%
Oh. Think [laughter].

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:13.557 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

00:58:13.557 --> 00:58:14.591 align:middle line:90%
It's working.

00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:16.426 align:middle line:84%
The lists at home,
I have them, too.

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:17.494 align:middle line:84%
It's -- it's slowing
down, whatever that is.

00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:18.295 align:middle line:90%
It slows down.

00:58:18.295 --> 00:58:19.496 align:middle line:90%
You don't like those lists.

00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:21.965 align:middle line:84%
No. She ain't wanting
to do those lists.

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Mmm, yes. Isn't that funny?

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:24.935 align:middle line:90%
Okay, can I try something?

00:58:24.935 --> 00:58:25.835 align:middle line:90%
This might be fun.

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes. You have a maid.

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:28.505 align:middle line:90%
Oh. I'm trying hypnosis.

00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:29.039 align:middle line:90%
You have a maid.

00:58:29.039 --> 00:58:29.739 align:middle line:90%
Please, God.

00:58:29.739 --> 00:58:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. You have a maid.

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:33.243 align:middle line:84%
Yes. All right, somebody
else's right now --

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:35.879 align:middle line:84%
those elves, you know, the
elves and the shoemaker?

00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:38.248 align:middle line:90%
You've got list elves.

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:40.150 align:middle line:90%
And she opens right back up.

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:41.484 align:middle line:84%
You're not quite
buying it [laughter].

00:58:41.484 --> 00:58:42.886 align:middle line:90%
You're not quite buying it.

00:58:42.886 --> 00:58:46.289 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Now I ruined
your time [laughter]

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:50.026 align:middle line:84%
because you're thinking
about your lists.

00:58:50.026 --> 00:58:52.262 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear it for
Suzanne, huh [applause]?

00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:54.864 align:middle line:90%
Suzanne, thank you.

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:56.866 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Suzanne.

00:58:56.866 --> 00:59:02.105 align:middle line:84%
I have used the pendulum as a
lie detector test for people.

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:03.406 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, show me how you do that.

00:59:03.406 --> 00:59:05.942 align:middle line:90%
Well, up and down is yes.

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:07.744 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm. That way is no.

00:59:07.744 --> 00:59:10.747 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. And I will write
it on a piece of paper.

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:12.315 align:middle line:90%
I'll put yes, yes, no, no.

00:59:12.315 --> 00:59:12.849 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:13.650 align:middle line:90%
Right? Yep.

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:14.451 align:middle line:90%
Just like this.

00:59:14.451 --> 00:59:15.719 align:middle line:90%
Yep. This would be yes, yes.

00:59:15.719 --> 00:59:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Yep. This would be no, no.

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.722 align:middle line:84%
And then you hold
the pendulum...

00:59:18.722 --> 00:59:21.091 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...over it,
and you tune people in,

00:59:21.091 --> 00:59:23.159 align:middle line:90%
and you ask them questions.

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:25.962 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough you
get great answers.

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:27.731 align:middle line:90%
I did this at a party once.

00:59:27.731 --> 00:59:28.999 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:59:28.999 --> 00:59:31.134 align:middle line:84%
And I had some -- one
of my friends came by.

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:34.604 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. And we did it for him,
and his wife was there, and...

00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:37.707 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. ...everybody's --
you know couples were there.

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:39.843 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him some
yes or no questions

00:59:39.843 --> 00:59:41.611 align:middle line:90%
and tuned him right up.

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:45.715 align:middle line:84%
And then my last question was,
just to be silly [gasping],

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:46.883 align:middle line:90%
have you ever had an affair?

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:48.685 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no! And it went yes.

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:50.787 align:middle line:84%
Oh! He dropped it and
ran out of the room.

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:51.488 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my stars.

00:59:51.488 --> 00:59:52.522 align:middle line:90%
And they got divorced.

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:53.957 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my stars!

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:54.958 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible conversations]
Unbelievable.

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.026 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe they
needed to get divorced.

00:59:56.026 --> 00:59:56.893 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it that way.

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:57.994 align:middle line:90%
I ruined them.

00:59:57.994 --> 00:59:59.429 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] No, he --
he did it [laughter].

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.697 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very accurate.

01:00:00.697 --> 01:00:03.133 align:middle line:84%
They're very accurate because
you're measuring energy,

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:04.234 align:middle line:90%
and energy doesn't lie.

01:00:04.234 --> 01:00:05.568 align:middle line:90%
No. People can lie...

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:06.336 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't lie at all.

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:07.437 align:middle line:90%
...but energy doesn't lie.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:08.772 align:middle line:84%
Where can people find
you on your Website?

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:10.774 align:middle line:90%
Website, cyndidale.com.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:14.177 align:middle line:84%
It's spelled funny,
C-Y-N-D-I, cyndidale.com.

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:14.744 align:middle line:90%
That's where I am.

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:15.311 align:middle line:90%
And your books?

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:15.945 align:middle line:90%
Still available?

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:16.746 align:middle line:90%
They're out there?

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:17.947 align:middle line:90%
They're all out there, yep.

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:19.249 align:middle line:84%
And -- and where -- where
do you go in the future?

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:20.283 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you?

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:23.353 align:middle line:84%
More books, more
baseball, more fiction.

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:25.288 align:middle line:84%
I really am going to do what
I said I was going to do

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.389 align:middle line:90%
when I was a little kid.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:28.358 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to work
on some teen fiction.

01:00:28.358 --> 01:00:30.427 align:middle line:84%
So working on that
and some classes.

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:30.994 align:middle line:90%
You enjoy writing?

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:31.628 align:middle line:90%
I like writing.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.328 align:middle line:90%
Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:32.829 align:middle line:90%
It's... It -- it's fun.

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:34.230 align:middle line:90%
It is fun.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.498 align:middle line:84%
I've -- I've written a couple
books, but it's a lot of work.

01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:37.033 align:middle line:84%
It's more work than
people think.

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:39.235 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. It's really about
having a good editor, I think.

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:41.471 align:middle line:84%
And you can't start
until it clicks.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:42.505 align:middle line:84%
[Snap fingers] No,
it has to just...

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And once it clicks,
then you're okay.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:44.908 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:46.409 align:middle line:84%
Then you're okay, exactly
my experience, too.

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.544 align:middle line:90%
Well, good.

01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:48.778 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear it for Cyndi
Dale, huh [applause]?

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:49.779 align:middle line:90%
Subtle energy.

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.414 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Cyndi.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.986 align:middle line:84%
Who would think that you
could use energy for healing,

01:00:56.986 --> 01:01:00.023 align:middle line:84%
for developing incredible
things about the mind?

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:04.194 align:middle line:84%
But Cyndi does, and it works for
her, and it can work for you.

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:06.362 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief .
