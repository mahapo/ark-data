novels you have out there,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.085 align:middle line:90%
they're all different.

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KEVIN J. ANDERSON: I just
can't write them fast enough.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.610 align:middle line:90%
Every time I finish one--

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: --I
think of two more.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.380 align:middle line:84%
My brain is just kind of wired
that, when I see something,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I think, oh, that would
make a good story.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Or what if this happened
instead of that?

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
think science fiction has done

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:84%
is sort of prepared
people for possibilities.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, "The X-Files,"
for season after season,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:84%
just showed us, here's something
maybe you didn't know about

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.660 align:middle line:90%
or even consider.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I want us to have
the future that I

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:84%
dreamed about when I was that
kid reading science fiction.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
The things that are
mysterious out there, to me,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.654 align:middle line:84%
just adds this magic and a
sense of wonder to the world.

to another great edition

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

Kevin J. Anderson
with us, author

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:10%
of 175 novels ranging from
science fiction to fantasy

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:10%
to horror.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:84%

"Dune," "X-Files," "Star Trek,"

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:90%
and more.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:90%
What a career!

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.453 align:middle line:90%
How can you be so prolific?

00:01:15.453 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I just make
up stuff all the time.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You must
live at a typewriter.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Well, no.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I do my writing when
I'm out dictating.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.810 align:middle line:10%
I get inspired by nature
when I'm out talking.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:10%
And I just tell
stories to myself,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:10%
and I'm just happy that
millions of other people

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:10%
like to read them too.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you remember
it and come back and make it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:90%
into a book form.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.690 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDERSON: Well, I
dictate it into a recorder,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:10%
and I have a typist
who transcribes it.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the drive up
here to this interview,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.275 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a part of a short story.

>>NOORY: Rod Serling would
do exactly what you're doing.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
He would sit in his pool,
floating with a Dictaphone,

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
doing "Twilight Zone"
episodes on the ones he wrote.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.587 align:middle line:84%
And his secretary
would transcribe it.

00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, I live here
in Colorado where we're filming,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a beautiful
place with all the mountains.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.987 align:middle line:84%
And I can do the
Great Sand Dunes

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:90%
when I'm writing a "Dune" novel.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I can be up in the
snowy mountains

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
when I'm doing a big,
epic fantasy or something.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fantastic.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And there have been
all kinds of studies about--

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:84%
your creativity gets
unlocked when you're

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:90%
doing some physical activity.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And so I
like to just go walk.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:90%
I've done 25 miles in a day.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Just on the Colorado trail, I'll
go in these beautiful venues

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:90%
and huge, open nature.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And it just inspires me
to see what's possible.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just wandering around.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.232 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well,
kind of on a trail.

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:32.205 align:middle line:84%
But I know where I'm going, and
I know where I'm coming back.

00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You must
have been, as a child,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:90%
fascinated with science fiction.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, I grew up in
this very small, isolated town

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:90%
in Wisconsin.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So it was like the
typical Midwestern farming

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
town, where I was the only
kid who read comic books.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I was the only kid who
watched monster movies

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.320 align:middle line:84%
every Saturday afternoon
instead of going out

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.580 align:middle line:90%
and play like normal kids.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
I would stay in, and
I'd watch the Chicago

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:90%
station of sci-fi cinema.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.287 align:middle line:84%
And I just watched over and
over again the UFO movies--

00:03:04.287 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm the same way.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: --the
Godzilla movies.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And because the environment
there was so normal,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
my imagination just
was hungry, and I

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:90%
wanted to figure out things.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would look up
at the stars at night.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:90%
I had a little telescope.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would just,
like, what's out there?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And I would make up stories.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And I read all kinds of myths
and legends and history.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And they all became
stories to me,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and I just can't write
them fast enough.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Every time I finish one,
I think of two more.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you ever--

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
with your little telescope
because I had one too--

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
look at the stars and think
of them as, perhaps, UFOs,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:90%
wanting them to move?

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.185 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to
think, move, move, move.

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever do that?

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, I
had a subscription

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:90%
to "Astronomy Magazine."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So I had all these charts,
and I could go look in here

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and see if you can
find a globular cluster

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.343 align:middle line:84%
or look and find the
Andromeda Galaxy.

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --or Jupiter.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.218 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Or Jupiter.

00:04:02.218 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And you could see
the moons of Jupiter.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And the things that I could
see and label were one thing,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
but there was a million
other things there

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know
what they were.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.964 align:middle line:84%
I just let my imagination
roam and think,

00:04:16.964 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:90%
well, how far away is this?

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Is there somebody on that little
dot that's looking back at us?

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know my
father and mother

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
got me a little telescope
when I was a kid.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at
the moon, I was in awe

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.728 align:middle line:84%
because you could
actually see the craters.

00:04:31.728 --> 00:04:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And you could
see the shadows and the lines

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:90%
and the mountains.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then I looked
at Jupiter and saw those four

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:90%
moons of the many Jupiter has--

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.640 align:middle line:84%
but the four big ones
just standing out.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
But what really captured
my attention, Kevin--

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.735 align:middle line:90%
when I looked at Saturn.

00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: All the rings.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.482 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you could
see the small, little ring

00:04:48.482 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.302 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

00:04:52.302 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, and
you know it's real.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had seen
"Astronomy Magazine"--

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
like the photos, all the
Hubble Space Telescope

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:90%
photos and everything.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course they're
way better than what

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:84%
you see through the telescope,
but you're seeing it

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.187 align:middle line:90%
through your own eyes.

00:05:05.187 --> 00:05:08.158 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.158 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:84%
You're taking it into
your heart and your mind,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:84%
knowing that there's
another planet out there,

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:84%
another set of moons out
there, a whole universe.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to tell
stories about it.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:84%
I just kept thinking of alien
cultures or magic systems

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:90%
and wizards.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't make
any distinction.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:90%
It just all seemed--

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.092 align:middle line:84%
fascinating things
to me that I liked.

00:05:31.092 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that what
fueled your ability

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.463 align:middle line:90%
to write so many novels?

00:05:34.463 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah, I
feel like, if I ever

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.755 align:middle line:84%
stopped writing, my
head would explode,

00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:90%
that I've primed the pump.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Too much info.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: I'm up to speed now.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
I kind of got this
momentum going.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And every time I
look at something--

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I watch the news, and
I read science news,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and I read things--
and I just go, well,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:90%
what if that went wrong?

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Or what if something-- and you
just extrapolate from there.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned how to-- like
a basketball player knows how

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:90%
to make an easy--

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dunk shot.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: --dunk shot, I
just know how to do a story.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you
categorize yourself?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
As a science writer, a
science fiction writer,

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.193 align:middle line:90%
a paranormalist?

00:06:11.193 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, how would you
categorize yourself?

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: I'm a storyteller.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not like the person
that English professors

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:84%
analyze my metaphors and
go over every sentence,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:90%
but I tell a darn, good story.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Characters are all
over in my head.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I know so many different people,
and I take pieces of them

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:90%
to create my own characters.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I really understand
story structure.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, by
studying myths and legends,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I have all the raw
material for fantasy.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
By studying astronomy
and science news,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
it gives me jumping points for
doing a biological plague story

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:84%
or an AI meltdown kind of story
or different things like that.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.635 align:middle line:84%
And I just love the stories
and the plots that happen.

00:06:55.635 --> 00:06:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your
work show that.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And I love
entertaining other people.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:06:59.745 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
in the paranormal
aspect of this.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, part of it
is, I worked for the "X-Files"

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:90%
for quite a while.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.587 align:middle line:84%
And before that, of course,
I had been reading--

00:07:07.587 --> 00:07:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
was in eighth grade,

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I read a bunch of the
"Project Blue Book" books.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And just looking at
the old, grainy photos,

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:84%
the classic photos of old UFO
sightings or Bigfoot sightings.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And all of it made me wonder
what's really out there.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
exciting, not terrifying.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I really want to clarify
that, that I found

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
the fact that there are
things we don't know

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and the things that are
mysterious out there, to me,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.997 align:middle line:84%
just adds this magic and a
sense of wonder to the world.

00:07:40.997 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And I think writing
science fiction kind of helps

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
prepare the audience
to have an open mind

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:90%
to see different possibilities.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know former
FBI Agent John DeSouza,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:90%
by any chance?

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: I don't think so.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to him on the
program about covering up

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:90%
paranormal phenomena.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Is the government doing that?

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this, Kevin.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:90%
What does this tell you?

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.278 align:middle line:84%
What are you convinced
is happening?

00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN DESOUZA: What I'm
convinced is happening--

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm sure you
have a conclusion by now.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: --is that we
have alien visitors who

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:84%
are trying to reach
out to us all the time.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
opposing force--

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:90%
irresistible, opposing force--

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DESOUZA: Here-- of
mainstream authorities

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
that are determined to keep
us from this knowledge, even

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
when it's right in
front of our eyes, even

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:90%
when it's completely obvious.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't
hide this stuff.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.482 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: They cannot hide it.

00:08:34.482 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
All they can do is
falsify after the fact.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.950 align:middle line:84%
All they can do is mutter
off things like icicles, ice

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:90%
debris, and nonsense like that.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we're
still so culturally trained

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.385 align:middle line:90%
that people still believe.

00:08:50.385 --> 00:08:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was
going to say that.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:84%
People would be more
apt to believe what

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:90%
the government feeds them--

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --than what
you actually see.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>DESOUZA: Yes, which is insane.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:84%
That is insanity because
these things are reaching out

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:90%
for us every day.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:84%
They are being shown to us
right in front of our faces.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we are still
deferring to NASA

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and government entities that are
just doing what they're told.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:84%
They are told to cover
this up, and so they just

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.670 align:middle line:90%
follow the orders.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.997 align:middle line:90%
They follow orders.

00:09:19.997 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thank our
lucky stars, Kevin,

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:84%
we have writers like you who
use science fiction and science

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.635 align:middle line:84%
to get the word out because
I think DeSouza's right.

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And just
how every many--

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
six months ago or so, when
they finally declassified some

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:90%
of the stuff--

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:84%
it was very interesting
to me because I

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:84%
know a lot of actual
astrophysicists

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and NASA scientists
and military people.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And before that
happened, a bunch of them

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.322 align:middle line:84%
were coming to
me, saying, you've

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:90%
got to pay attention to this.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Something big is going
to be coming out.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: The stuff
was coming to me.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they didn't
reveal anything to me,

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:84%
but they were saying,
this is really serious.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
these were people

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.730 align:middle line:84%
that I was in awe of, that
I really respected them

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:90%
and their opinions were not--

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.862 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these weren't just crazy
people who jumped on anything.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.320 align:middle line:84%
These were people
that are somebody

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:90%
that I would listen to.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.023 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:10:16.023 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And
they really thought

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.310 align:middle line:90%
that there was something there.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that made me pay a
whole lot more attention to it.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and you can tell
that you put that influence

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.995 align:middle line:90%
into your works.

00:10:26.995 --> 00:10:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well,
one of the things

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
that I think science
fiction has done

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:84%
is sort of prepared a lot
of people for possibilities.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, "The X-Files" week after
week, for season after season

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
just showed us, here's something
maybe you didn't know about

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:90%
or even consider.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Here's something that
might be happening

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.945 align:middle line:84%
that you can use
your imagination

00:10:49.945 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:90%
and pay attention to.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not all true.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:84%
But some of it might
be interesting,

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.195 align:middle line:84%
and it might be something
that you can consider.

00:10:57.195 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
there's alien life out there?

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
they're showing up here

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:84%
in laundromat parking lots, but
I think that they are certainly

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:90%
out here.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But maybe.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Maybe.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that the best line that
"The X-Files" ever came up with

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:90%
was, I want to believe.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I think that
that summarizes everything.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be a skeptic
until you prove it to me,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:84%
but I want to be open-minded,
and I want to see something.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you familiar with
the work of the late Zecharia

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Sitchin?

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: No, I'm not.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:84%
He's not with us
anymore, but he believes

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.300 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki came
from another planet they

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
called Nibiru, which is a
planet in our solar system.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:84%
It's on a 3,600-year
elliptical orbit.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And they came here and seeded
us from whatever creatures

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:84%
were on the planet at the
time and played around

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.700 align:middle line:90%
and manipulated us.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing concept.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But he gets all that
from Sumerian texts

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that he found in
cuneiforms-- clay tablets.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing story.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Wow.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Somebody should write
a novel about that.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody should.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm looking at him.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a lot of research.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing this,
even if it is fiction--

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:90%
and I make very clear.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm just writing novels.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing fiction.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:84%
But that requires
a lot of research

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.960 align:middle line:84%
because I have to know more
than I put into the writing.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the writing, it has to
be convincing enough so that

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.080 align:middle line:84%
my readers-- even the
most skeptical readers--

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.502 align:middle line:84%
will think that
this is possible.

00:12:29.502 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they're
not going to follow me

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:90%
through to the end of the book.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the 175
novels you have out there,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.900 align:middle line:90%
they're all different.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And then they're all related
in some form or fashion.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:84%
What fascinates you about
what you write about, Kevin?

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: See, I
write different--

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of them
are kind of fantasy,

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:84%
magical, "Lord of the
Rings" kind of things.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And other ones
are big, epic science fiction,

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.350 align:middle line:90%
like the "Dune" work I do.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I've got big-- they're called
space operas, like "Star Trek"

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.843 align:middle line:90%
or "The Expanse" and things.

00:13:00.843 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
other ones that

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
are sort of dark
fantasy, horror,

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:84%
thrillers with vampires,
serial killers,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:90%
hauntings, things like that.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%
You wear a different
hat when you're writing

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:90%
different ones of those.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like, one night
I'll cook Italian,

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and another night I'll cook
Indian food or something

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's a different skill
set to bring to those.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But because I feel like I want
to convey these great stories

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:90%
and a sense of wonder--

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that's the through line, I
think, through all of my stuff,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.930 align:middle line:84%
is this sense of wonder
and possibilities.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you don't think
we've been contacted by ETs,

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.570 align:middle line:84%
but you believe
they're out there,

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:84%
are you open to the
possibility that one day we

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:90%
will be contacted by them?

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.995 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Oh, and I didn't
say that we haven't been.

00:13:50.995 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
There's two different
parts to your question.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Like, are there alien
life forms out there?

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.885 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I look up
through my telescope--

00:13:55.885 --> 00:13:57.177 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely, slam dunk.

00:13:57.177 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: --and I
see billions of stars,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
it is inconceivable
that, even just

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
by rolling the genetic
dice, that something

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:90%
didn't happen out there.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:84%
There are a whole
bunch of factors

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.120 align:middle line:84%
as to whether they
have the ability

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:90%
to cross interstellar space--

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:84%
whether their civilization is
in existence at the same time

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:90%
that our civilization is.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.470 align:middle line:84%
In all those stars, there could
be the biggest galactic empire

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.820 align:middle line:84%
out there, but it faded
away 10 million years ago.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.078 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And
there are all sorts

00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
of reasons why just the
energy requirements of coming

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
from the Andromeda
Galaxy or something

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.420 align:middle line:84%
like that-- the
time span required.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Those are all factors
that work against having

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Grand Central Station here
on Earth-- people coming.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But whether it's ever
happened or not--

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm not skeptical about that.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I just would like to know
what the difference is.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:84%
To me, the biggest
thing, though,

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:84%
is that of all of
those possibilities--

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:84%
all those billions
of star systems,

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:90%
all those potential life forms--

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:84%
whether something would
evolve to the point

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:84%
where their intelligence
is even remotely

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:90%
comprehensible to ours.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Correct.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Like, on "Star
Trek" you have pointy ears,

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
and that's an alien.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:84%
That's a human
with pointy years.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are so
many different possible life

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:29.300 align:middle line:84%
forms of living sentients that
could be deep in the cloud

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:90%
bands of Jupiter.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Or they could live inside
the magnetic cells of a star.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
There could be
bacterial colonies

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
that have developed some
kind of a hive mind that

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:84%
are under the ice
sheets of Europa--

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Are those aliens
going to be somebody

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.250 align:middle line:84%
that you'll walk up
to in a parking lot

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:90%
and communicate with?

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no shared
basis of understanding,

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
so that would make any kind
of communication difficult.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's just-- me rattling off
like this makes my mind filled

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
with, well, that would be really
exciting to contact some kind

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:90%
of an entity--

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: --that lives inside
the magnetic fields of a star.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think of
the alien abduction phenomena?

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: That, I'm a little
more skeptical of, unless

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:90%
it's somebody trying to--

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lots of people
think they've been abducted.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.393 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: They've all said it.

00:16:22.393 --> 00:16:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Unless it's aliens trying
to understand us, trying to

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.220 align:middle line:90%
do scientific experiments.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's one of
these other entities

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:84%
like I'm talking about
that just can't figure out

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:84%
who these critters
are walking around

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth that built
buildings and stuff like that.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
I think we've made enough
of an obvious mark on Earth

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:84%
with our buildings, with our
electromagnetic communications,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:90%
with everything.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of waving a red
flag and calling attention

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And so if you are
another alien intelligence,

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.990 align:middle line:90%
you're going to spot us.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think they're
going to come here and invade

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.787 align:middle line:84%
and steal our women, like
the old 1950s movies did.

00:17:04.787 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Fallen Angels."

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:90%
You never know, right?

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: But I think
that an intelligence should

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:84%
be at least interested in what
we're doing here because we're

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.194 align:middle line:90%
making a lot of noise.

00:17:17.194 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kevin, on
"Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.609 align:middle line:84%
another Gaia program, David
Adair, the Rocket Man,

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
discusses aliens and their
potential intentions.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID ADAIR: He was
very curious about what

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:84%
went on with me, and he asked
an awful lot of questions.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think some of the
interventions from the aliens

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.190 align:middle line:90%
have been positive.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And from what I can
gather from Bob,

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
there's multiple races
out there, multiple ships,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.837 align:middle line:90%
multiple agendas.

00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EMERY SMITH: Sure.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAIR: And I
don't know if we're

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:90%
being monitored or protected.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.890 align:middle line:90%
I suspect we are.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
People think, well, we're so far
out and the distance so vast,

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't be there.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:90%
I think there's pirate races--

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.280 align:middle line:84%
intergalactic
pirates, terrorists,

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:90%
whatever you call them--

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and they just go from planet
to planet destroying stuff.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.045 align:middle line:84%
Well, why haven't
we been taken out?

00:18:19.045 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:90%
You know, we stick out like a--

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
we're a big blue
and white marble

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.170 align:middle line:90%
in the blackness of space.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Lord, have mercy.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:84%
We've got to show up
on radars everywhere.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:90%
And the fact we're still here--

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:90%
somebody is looking out for us.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.295 align:middle line:90%
I am certain of that.

00:18:35.295 --> 00:18:36.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When
David was a kid, he

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:84%
built his own rocket, which
was about 6 feet tall,

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and launched it off and scared
the world and everything else.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But he believes that
we're being visited.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, I'm
not going to debate

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.460 align:middle line:84%
with him because I
don't know the details,

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:90%
and I keep an open mind.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what I like to have.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
tie science fiction

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.692 align:middle line:84%
into a lot of things
that are real science?

00:18:59.692 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Well, look.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:84%
The goal of science fiction
is to take real science

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.235 align:middle line:84%
and to ask a whole
bunch of "what ifs."

00:19:06.235 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And to
have fun with it.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And to have fun with
it and to tell a good story.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, some science
fiction is really

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.270 align:middle line:84%
grim and depressing
because the extrapolations

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.745 align:middle line:84%
that the author makes shows that
if we don't clean up our act,

00:19:17.745 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:84%
we're going to destroy
the environment.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Or we're going to unleash
a biological plague,

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.005 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to have a world
of artificial intelligence.

00:19:24.005 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of the above.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Or all of it.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:84%
But kind of in line with
what David was talking about,

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine a future I would
more rather have than like what

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:90%
we see in "Star Trek"--

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of exploration of
all kinds of different star

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.820 align:middle line:84%
systems, lots of
alien civilizations

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that we can encounter with
and, for the most part,

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:90%
get along with.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.853 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Although,
"Star Trek" also

00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:50.060 align:middle line:84%
has some really bizarre,
strange alien organisms,

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.300 align:middle line:84%
like the giant paramecium
in space and things

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:84%
like that in some
of the old episodes.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:10%
I just loved that
entire imagination

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.070 align:middle line:10%
of how they told their stories.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:10%
And they gave an
optimistic and hopeful view

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:10%
that we would survive.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.520 align:middle line:90%
We would get out there.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
We would go where no
one has gone before.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
what I hang my hat on.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that the human race
has a wonderful potential

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:90%
if we don't screw it up.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.368 align:middle line:84%
And let's hope that there are
more good guys than bad guys.

00:20:20.368 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think, Kevin, we
should continue with our space

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.275 align:middle line:90%
program?

00:20:24.275 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Oh, absolutely.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.032 align:middle line:84%
I think, just out
of self defense,

00:20:28.032 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
we've got to look
what's out there.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:90%
What if--

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I read that,
recently, an asteroid came

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:90%
pretty darn close to Earth.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And it went away, but we weren't
really paying attention to it

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We always see
them after they go past us.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.967 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah, it
would be nice to see them

00:20:40.967 --> 00:20:43.370 align:middle line:90%
before they're too close.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, that's
not an alien invasion.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:90%
That's just an asteroid.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.630 align:middle line:90%
There's rocks out there.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
craters on the moon

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:84%
through your own little
telescope when you were a kid.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Those craters were caused
because some rock struck

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:90%
the moon.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And so I think we
should be prepared for that.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But also, just think
about the space program.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.100 align:middle line:84%
When we were kids,
there was always

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:84%
the justification of,
well, NASA invented Tang,

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and they invented Teflon
and all these great things

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:90%
that the space program did.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:90%
But think about it.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Weather satellites and
communications satellites--

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:84%
if it wasn't for the satellite
network that was out there,

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have been
able to talk to my phone

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.660 align:middle line:90%
and say, hey, Siri.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Give me directions to the
studio so I could come today.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:84%
There are so many things
that we have used and built

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:90%
upon from the space program.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I just think it's a terrific
thing for our society.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that we
have an International Space

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Station out there that's
doing materials research.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.950 align:middle line:84%
They're doing biological
research up there.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I want us to have
the future that I

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:84%
dreamed about when I was that
kid reading science fiction.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you?

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.167 align:middle line:90%
What pushes you to keep writing?

00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I just-- I
love telling stories.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:90%
I love entertaining people.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And my brain is
just kind of wired

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.980 align:middle line:84%
that, when I see something,
I think, oh, that

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:90%
would make a good story.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Or what if this happened
instead of that?

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just like
chasing that down.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Like athletes like
to make a touchdown,

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.368 align:middle line:90%
I like to finish a novel.

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you do a
great job with them, Kevin.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Well, I try to.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.017 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do a great job.

00:22:21.017 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence-- what
are your thoughts about that?

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Back
in the '60s, it was

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.710 align:middle line:84%
like everybody was terrified
about computers were

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.040 align:middle line:90%
going to take over the world.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And they had kind
of these corny--

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, they did.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Didn't they?

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.145 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, they did, but
not in the way that we thought.

00:22:36.145 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had these
corny, giant computer

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:84%
banks with blinking lights
that went on and off.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.065 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The UNIVACs.

00:22:42.065 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And then
they showed robots.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and they showed
robots taking over the world

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.030 align:middle line:90%
and killing off humans.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was a
much more subtle takeover

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and that computers have sort
of infiltrated everything.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And we now use them,
and guess what?

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:90%
They're not scary.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I use, like I said--

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're used to it.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.588 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: We're used to it.

00:23:03.588 --> 00:23:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, people talk to Alexa.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:90%
People talk to Siri.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
When I've got my grandsons
that are with me--

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it
talks back to you.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: And it talks back.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And it talks back in a way
that, if you're not really

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.610 align:middle line:84%
paying attention, you feel like
you're having a conversation.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:84%
When I'm bored
with the grandsons,

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.087 align:middle line:84%
I say, Alexa, tell
us some jokes.

00:23:22.087 --> 00:23:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And she'll just rattle
off a bunch of jokes.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's amazing.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing technology.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And I used
to have-- my car was

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:84%
filled with maps of everywhere
that I needed to go.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And before I came
up to Denver, I'd

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:84%
be looking at the street
maps and figure out

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.450 align:middle line:90%
where all the turns are.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever look
at maps anymore.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.483 align:middle line:84%
I just say, give me
directions to this place.

00:23:41.483 --> 00:23:42.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Find this place.

00:23:42.525 --> 00:23:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And before
I packed my suitcase

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
to come here, I just lifted
my head and literally said,

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Alexa, what's the weather
in Boulder tomorrow?

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.957 align:middle line:84%
And then poof, I just
get the information.

00:23:52.957 --> 00:23:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean the
technology's incredible.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Look what it's done to us.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's made life so
much more efficient.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:84%
But like you said, we've
got our smartphones.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I think the Uber
technology is incredible.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Oh, and literally
Uber-- when the drivers--

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
they don't ever look
up where they're going.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
They just look at their
map and they take--

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they listen to it.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Right.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was a couple of
years ago when my parents

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.990 align:middle line:90%
lived in Kingman, Arizona.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was at their house
in the middle of nowhere.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And I needed a ride back to our
hotel, and so I set up an Uber.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And I just walked out of the
front door of their house,

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.460 align:middle line:90%
and this car drove by.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And I showed my dad on
my smartphone screen,

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:34.815 align:middle line:90%
saying, yep, that's the car.

00:24:34.815 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Here it's coming, and it
shows it's a white Nissan.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got
the guy's name,

00:24:38.315 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:90%
and it's got the license number.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: And he just--

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.330 align:middle line:90%
it boggled his mind.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:90%
You could just see all that.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's good things.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And as science
fiction, of course,

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
our job is to warn you about
stuff that could go wrong.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:84%
From "The Terminator,"
the classic,

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:84%
the SkyNet takes over and
shuts everything down.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And there have been stuff that
I think is a little bit scary.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.920 align:middle line:84%
In 2016, Microsoft did this
really interesting experiment.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.200 align:middle line:84%
They had one of their
chatbots-- an AI,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.760 align:middle line:84%
a little something
that's supposed

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:15.310 align:middle line:84%
to learn from what it interacts
with and evolve and get better.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:90%
It was named Tay, T-A-Y.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And they took this
chatbot, and they basically

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.010 align:middle line:84%
unleashed it into
Twitter to watch Twitter

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.017 align:middle line:84%
and to learn and then
adapt its personality.

00:25:27.017 --> 00:25:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On its own?

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: On its own.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it wasn't going
to take over anything.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:84%
It just-- the
personality evolved.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And within 24 hours,
after all it did

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:84%
was look at the crap that's
posted on Twitter constantly,

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
it turned into this loud,
racist, white supremacist

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
idiot, and they had
to shut it down.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was a setup.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well,
it wasn't a scam.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- an AI learns
from what it's exposed to.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.268 align:middle line:90%
And if you throw it into a--

00:25:54.268 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you don't think
it got hacked or anything?

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: No, it
read all of the tweets,

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.105 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of started spiraling
off into the more radical

00:26:02.105 --> 00:26:02.905 align:middle line:90%
stuff--

00:26:02.905 --> 00:26:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It thought
that was the norm.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.653 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: --and thought
that was the norm,

00:26:05.653 --> 00:26:06.453 align:middle line:90%
and it became that.

00:26:06.453 --> 00:26:07.253 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:26:07.253 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I had a really
interesting conversation

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:84%
with an AI specialist
friend of mine

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:84%
who was working with Google
on their self-driving cars.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.087 align:middle line:90%
And those are-- they're coming.

00:26:19.087 --> 00:26:20.170 align:middle line:90%
They're self-driving cars.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:21.837 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it or
not, they're coming.

00:26:21.837 --> 00:26:24.282 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I can imagine
how much time I can get just

00:26:24.282 --> 00:26:26.740 align:middle line:84%
reading in the back of a car
instead of driving, although I

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:90%
kind of like driving.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.450 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'll never get a DUI.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Well, that's true.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But here's the part that
really fascinated me.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:84%
He introduced me to a comrade
of his, a coworker who was--

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:90%
the job was an AI ethicist.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And this person
was working with--

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: --the self-driving
car AIs and programming

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:84%
because if you're programming
an AI to drive your car,

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.770 align:middle line:84%
there are situations
that can come up.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:84%
The job of the AI
driving your car

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.788 align:middle line:84%
is to protect the
passengers, right?

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, you would hope.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.205 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: That's its job.

00:27:06.205 --> 00:27:08.380 align:middle line:84%
It has to it has to
protect the passengers.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But what if-- whatever
contrived circumstances

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:16.060 align:middle line:84%
you come up with-- there is
a woman pushing a baby cart

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.050 align:middle line:84%
carriage across the street, and
the car is going to hit her.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.430 align:middle line:90%
And so it has to stop.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
But if it doesn't,
basically, the AI's

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:84%
put in an untenable
situation that either--

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you hit your
head because it stop too fast?

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.108 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: If it stops
to protect this person,

00:27:32.108 --> 00:27:34.140 align:middle line:84%
it's going to harm
the passenger.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:90%
What choice does it make?

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
set of decision trees.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And what if-- extrapolated as a
science fiction person would--

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:84%
what if this AI knows
who the passengers are.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And it can somehow know who
the person crossing the street

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.680 align:middle line:84%
is and goes, well, the
person crossing the street

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:84%
is a cancer researcher who's
won 100 medical awards.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And the person
that is a passenger

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.740 align:middle line:84%
is being taken to
his arraignment

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.490 align:middle line:90%
for child molesting.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, then
which one do you choose?

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: The next thing they
came up with-- and this just

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:90%
also blew my mind.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:84%
These are the AI
ethicists discussing this.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And they said, all of their
decisions they're putting down

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.090 align:middle line:84%
are basically based
on a foundation

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:30.030 align:middle line:84%
of Judeo-Christian
morality about what's right

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and what is wrong and what's the
value of life and everything.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:37.710 align:middle line:84%
But they said, what if the
person programming the AI

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and making all these
decisions-- what

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.902 align:middle line:84%
if that person has an
entirely different moral

00:28:42.902 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:90%
or religious structure?

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
What if it was an
Isis person who was

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.173 align:middle line:90%
programming self-driving cars?

00:28:47.173 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Decisions would
be entirely different.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There you go.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.555 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: That scares me.

00:28:51.555 --> 00:28:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your novels, you
have incredible messages.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:84%
In films, they
have messages, too,

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.585 align:middle line:90%
about artificial intelligence.

00:28:59.585 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what Nolan
does in "Interstellar."

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.730 align:middle line:10%
He has the TARS, the
AI robot that actually

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:06.900 align:middle line:10%
looks like the monolith.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:10%
And Bowman kind of go into
the Tesseract together.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually in the movie,
our tools rebel against us.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:84%
The AI, represented by Hal,
begins to kill the astronauts.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.880 align:middle line:10%
And Kubrick is definitely
saying that if we go down

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.600 align:middle line:10%
this path where we
let AI run our lives,

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:10%
it's going to be our end.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.080 align:middle line:10%
It's going to kill
us in the end.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.910 align:middle line:10%
So Bowman eventually
has to disconnect Hal

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:36.690 align:middle line:10%
from the spaceship, disconnect
himself from the AI.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And when he does that,
he goes into the monolith

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:84%
after he disconnects Hal, and he
goes into an enlightened state,

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:84%
a higher evolved state that the
aliens are taking him through.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And then he dies and
becomes a star child

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and goes back to
Earth, presumably

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:84%
to begin the process of
enlightenment on Earth.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's a
direct connection that Kubrick

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.180 align:middle line:84%
is making between
the enslavement

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:08.850 align:middle line:84%
to robots and AI and the
rebellion against those robots

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:12.808 align:middle line:84%
connected to our own
advancement and enlightenment.

00:30:12.808 --> 00:30:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kevin, I
think you're right.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I think what people are afraid
of with artificial intelligence

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.580 align:middle line:84%
is that it becomes so
intelligent it makes up

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:84%
its own mind-- what's
right, what's wrong.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And
what if it is right?

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
what if it's wrong?

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: What if we have
done so many bad things--

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.630 align:middle line:90%
what if it's wrong?

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:84%
What if we have done so many bad
things, this AI thinks it's God

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.480 align:middle line:90%
and says, you know what?

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.933 align:middle line:84%
In order to save
the planet, I've

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:37.350 align:middle line:84%
got to get rid of these annoying
little people that keep--

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We have to punish you.

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:39.230 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: But I
don't really want

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to get into an alarmist
thing there because I

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:48.330 align:middle line:84%
think that A's have helped us
reach our human potential so

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:90%
much.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you're right.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.248 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Imagine--

00:30:52.248 --> 00:30:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd rather
have it than not.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Remember
when you wanted

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.230 align:middle line:90%
to look up a simple fact.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.830 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to know
Napoleon's birthday,

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:06.280 align:middle line:84%
you had to go to the library
and look it up in the reference

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.080 align:middle line:90%
desk somewhere.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.997 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, exactly.

00:31:07.997 --> 00:31:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And now
all of that information

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.930 align:middle line:84%
we have is instantly
at our fingertips.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.300 align:middle line:84%
When I'm researching
for my novels,

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I have more knowledge by just
typing in something in Google

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.270 align:middle line:84%
than I used to have in my
entire university library.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And I can
find it instantly.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to go--

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.250 align:middle line:90%
remember card catalogs?

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
You used to go and
look in card catalogs

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.850 align:middle line:90%
in the library to find--

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Here's the
subject, and then you'd

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.480 align:middle line:84%
have to go by the
Dewey Decimal System

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:90%
and go walking up and down.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go find the reference.

00:31:38.145 --> 00:31:39.853 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And then
you'd find the book.

00:31:39.853 --> 00:31:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
had the book, you'd

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:44.970 align:middle line:84%
have to flip through the book
to find that one paragraph

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:45.870 align:middle line:90%
that you wanted.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to do that
anymore because it's

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:90%
right at our fingertips.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And just think of the amount
of time that that saves.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.330 align:middle line:84%
That's how I can write
175 books because I

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:58.680 align:middle line:90%
don't have to spend two years--

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you can do
it straight from a room.

00:31:59.625 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yes!

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.383 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Your
computer in a room.

00:32:01.383 --> 00:32:02.183 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:32:02.183 --> 00:32:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I don't have
to go somewhere to do my--

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.720 align:middle line:84%
When I was in
undergrad in college,

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I used to spend days, afternoons
in the college library,

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.260 align:middle line:84%
just reading some book and going
back and shelving it and going

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.970 align:middle line:90%
back to get another one.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:20.500 align:middle line:84%
That has freed up so much time
for me to do other things.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you just think about
the access and convenience

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:90%
We, humans, because of AIs--

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.390 align:middle line:84%
because of Siri and Alexa
and because of Google--

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:37.890 align:middle line:84%
we have basically the sum
total of human knowledge

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:90%
at our fingertips.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.610 align:middle line:84%
You can't believe everything
that you get because you

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:90%
get contradictory stuff.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And Wikipedia isn't
always curated.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.133 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Or somebody
might have hacked into it.

00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:50.527 align:middle line:84%
But still, you can have
access to something.

00:32:50.527 --> 00:32:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's still
great information.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: It's way,
way better than that.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I think
about how tedious it

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:00.070 align:middle line:84%
used to be to find
simple things,

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy with
the convenience.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But also, I love it,
but there are times when

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I find it a little bit creepy.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.940 align:middle line:84%
When I buy some
music from Amazon,

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.410 align:middle line:84%
then it'll recommend
other music.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then it
finds other things.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're looking
for a pair of shoes online.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.720 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you get
shoes coming every day

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.370 align:middle line:90%
for the next two weeks--

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:24.947 align:middle line:90%
shoe ads or whatever.

00:33:24.947 --> 00:33:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Until I figured
out what was going on,

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:30.560 align:middle line:90%
I would look on Amazon.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Terry Goodkind is
a fantasy author.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I looked up one of Terry
Goodkind's books on Amazon.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day, I
was on my Facebook profile,

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and Terry Goodkind
ads showed up.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He pops up.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And I
just went, but wait.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Are you guys talking
behind my computer screen?

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.780 align:middle line:90%
And they are.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's
incredible technology.

00:33:50.627 --> 00:33:51.960 align:middle line:90%
You wrote a book called "Stake."

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: So "Stake"--
that's in my vampire, horror,

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:57.570 align:middle line:90%
thriller stuff.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Your Anne Rice mode.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: But what I really
like about this one is,

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I play so much
with your beliefs.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It's about a guy
who fully believes

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:10.050 align:middle line:84%
in vampires-- completely
believes in vampires.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's researched it,
thinks he has evidence of it.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And so he thinks he's helping
the human race by tracking down

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:90%
vampires and killing them.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.940 align:middle line:10%
So he identifies--
this is actually

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.048 align:middle line:10%
set in Colorado Springs.

00:34:22.048 --> 00:34:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A vampire hunter, huh?

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.757 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: He's
a vampire hunter.

00:34:24.757 --> 00:34:27.719 align:middle line:84%
So he's find, like,
night watchman, people

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:31.500 align:middle line:84%
that work the midnight shift
in 7-Eleven stores and things.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.730 align:middle line:90%
And he'll track them down.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And when they're
there sleeping, he

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.810 align:middle line:84%
will kill them because he
thinks they're vampires.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:37.935 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hope he's right.

00:34:37.935 --> 00:34:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, if you're
the police detective,

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.300 align:middle line:84%
you've got this
crazy serial killer

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.699 align:middle line:84%
that's going around pounding
stakes through their heart.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:45.616 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:34:45.616 --> 00:34:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: But then
the central character--

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.380 align:middle line:90%
it's the person in between.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:84%
She's a person kind
of like George Noory.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.080 align:middle line:84%
She's got a podcast that's
about, I want to believe.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And she's
investigating cryptids.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's curious.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:34:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And
she's going, look.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I am open-minded, but I'm
going to be a skeptic,

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and you got to prove this to me.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And this vampire
killer is sending her

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:10.080 align:middle line:84%
all of his evidence,
and she's going,

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.450 align:middle line:90%
this is pretty darn convincing.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:16.390 align:middle line:84%
But then he kind
of gets this almost

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.780 align:middle line:84%
like a symbiotic relationship,
like a Hannibal Lecter-Clarice

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.330 align:middle line:84%
kind of thing because
she's starting to think,

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.730 align:middle line:90%
maybe he is really correct.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.430 align:middle line:84%
But then the police
detective is, no, the guy's

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:28.390 align:middle line:90%
murdering people.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:29.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's insane, yeah.

00:35:29.515 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And throughout
this whole book,

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I play it very carefully
through all three

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:90%
different perspectives.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So you don't know until the end
whether the guy's right or not

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That should be a movie.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: I'm working on it.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.182 align:middle line:90%
We got a script done.

00:35:42.182 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:90%
We've got our managers.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, that
would be fantastic.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: We got
directors attached.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.970 align:middle line:90%
We're working.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:46.860 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Stake."

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Not like a T-bone
steak, but like a stake.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.943 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these ideas flow to
you easily, or is it difficult?

00:35:51.943 --> 00:35:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Well, that one--

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.545 align:middle line:90%
I had the idea for a long time.

00:35:55.545 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had
the idea back when

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.150 align:middle line:90%
I was working on "The X-Files."

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:59.358 align:middle line:90%
I went, this is way too good.

00:35:59.358 --> 00:36:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I've got to keep
this for myself.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:05.080 align:middle line:84%
But I just didn't know how
to implement it into a story

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.910 align:middle line:90%
that all tied together.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I kept kind of banging at
it and banging at it until--

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.520 align:middle line:84%
this is like one of those
perfect moments as a writer.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: You
just keep looking

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.370 align:middle line:84%
at the-- it's like
a Rubik's cube.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it and
suddenly click.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It clicks right there.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.292 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Everything
goes into the right.

00:36:19.292 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And I just go, that's it.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And the book just
turned out great.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.670 align:middle line:84%
It came out as an
Audible original first.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And then the book was
published by Severn House.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, now
we've got a script done.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:32.230 align:middle line:90%
We've got directors attached.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.645 align:middle line:84%
We're hoping to get
it sold to a studio.

00:36:34.645 --> 00:36:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good luck on that.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:90%
There's a paranormal researcher.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.800 align:middle line:90%
His name is Chad Lewis.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:84%
He says that there are
real-life werewolf encounters.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAD LEWIS: I
like the werewolves.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:47.020 align:middle line:84%
The people that-- a good
friend and colleague of mine,

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:47.935 align:middle line:90%
Linda Godfrey--

00:36:47.935 --> 00:36:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know Linda well.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, she's been
on your "Coast to Coast"

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.730 align:middle line:90%
several times.

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And Linda first started getting
reports of people in Wisconsin

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:58.360 align:middle line:84%
on a small, rural
stretch of road that saw,

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.790 align:middle line:84%
for a lack of a better
term, a werewolf.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:02.410 align:middle line:84%
They said it was
the size of a bear

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.530 align:middle line:84%
but shaped more like a
wolf with a long muzzle,

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and that dark fur, and
that it was a biped.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.620 align:middle line:10%
And it was often seen on the
side of the road late at night,

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:12.970 align:middle line:10%
but not always.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The good news for
me is that most

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.470 align:middle line:84%
of the reports I
get from witnesses

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:21.010 align:middle line:84%
say that the creature didn't
charge them or attack them,

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:25.030 align:middle line:84%
that it almost seemed to
be more comfortable hiding

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.522 align:middle line:84%
in the shadows to get
back and be unobserved.

00:37:27.522 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It didn't
want to take somebody.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.650 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't looking for a kill
because many times people

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:36.280 align:middle line:84%
have seen it eating roadkill
or freshly-killed prey.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And I love stories like
that, the werewolf,

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.240 align:middle line:90%
because they shouldn't be here.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.210 align:middle line:84%
By all accounts, we should not
be getting reports of a wolf.

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:44.140 align:middle line:90%
But yet, we are.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.807 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
part human, part wolf?

00:37:45.807 --> 00:37:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Many people believe
they're shapeshifters,

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.020 align:middle line:84%
that they can
transform themselves

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:53.770 align:middle line:84%
at will from a human or
another animal into a wolf.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Others believe they're some
sort of canine that just haven't

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.260 align:middle line:84%
been discovered
yet, that they maybe

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.210 align:middle line:84%
broke off from
traditional wolves

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and that they walk upright.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And they've been reported
all over the world.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And now we're getting
more reports of werewolves

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.340 align:middle line:90%
than ever before.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Truly
remarkable, Kevin.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.340 align:middle line:90%
This could be real.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well,
and I'm really pretty

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:15.550 align:middle line:90%
open-minded about cryptids.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.800 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds of species
that we haven't seen before.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.745 align:middle line:84%
I don't know from
those sightings

00:38:20.745 --> 00:38:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that you just
mentioned that that

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.000 align:middle line:84%
would imply a shapeshifting
aspect of it--

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.180 align:middle line:84%
but just a big, hirsute, hairy,
like a Bigfoot type of thing.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I've spent so much time
out in the backcountry

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:34.990 align:middle line:84%
in the wilderness
here in Colorado.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:40.360 align:middle line:84%
You can get so far remote,
and there are so many isolated

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.160 align:middle line:84%
areas that if these creatures
are not very populous,

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and they're smart, and they
don't want to be seen--

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can hide forever.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I mean, I've
hiked so many miles and so

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.710 align:middle line:84%
many things, and I've only
seen a bear, like, twice.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.053 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen a mountain
lion, but I know they exist.

00:39:00.053 --> 00:39:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And if these
are rarer than that--

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.448 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've
never seen a carcass.

00:39:04.448 --> 00:39:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: So I think
that there are so

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:90%
many wonders in this world.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And it might be a
bad thing to find one

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.090 align:middle line:84%
because then everybody
would start hunting them.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever had
nightmares from your novels?

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: No.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:18.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I purge all of that
stuff by writing it down.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:90%
So I sleep like a baby.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.305 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you?

00:39:22.305 --> 00:39:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Well, I'm just
I'm writing a new "Dune"

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.020 align:middle line:90%
novel right now.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:30.690 align:middle line:84%
I've got a new steampunk
book that I'm working on.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.700 align:middle line:84%
I've got some more
comics that I'm writing.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I just I kind of do
lots of fun things.

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.830 align:middle line:84%
It's one story after
another for me.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.082 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to look
forward to hiking season

00:39:41.082 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:84%
because that's when
I can go out and just

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.520 align:middle line:84%
make up my stories
when I'm on the trail.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And did you know Chris
Carter well, from "X-Files?"

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: I've met
him a bunch of times.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.630 align:middle line:90%
He's the one who asked me--

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.130 align:middle line:90%
he read my "Star Wars" books.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And then he contacted
me and said,

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.640 align:middle line:90%
I love your "Star Wars" books.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Kevin, would you write
an "X-Files" book for me?

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.420 align:middle line:90%
And I did one, and he loved it.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up doing three of
them and a bunch of "X-Files"

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.680 align:middle line:90%
comics.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And we were together
at some "X-Files"

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.810 align:middle line:90%
conventions and things.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How'd you do
in school as a kid?

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.742 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Straight A's.

00:40:07.742 --> 00:40:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I knew it.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.723 align:middle line:90%
Favorite course?

00:40:11.723 --> 00:40:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Astronomy
and history.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.270 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like fantasy
and science fiction to me.

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.565 align:middle line:84%
Just stay healthy and keep
doing what you're doing.

00:40:18.565 --> 00:40:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And
the thing is, I'm

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.450 align:middle line:90%
doing what I love to be doing.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:23.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why I write so much
because I can't imagine

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.212 align:middle line:90%
something else I'd enjoy more.

00:40:25.212 --> 00:40:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
are you writing?

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Every day.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Something every day.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Short
stories, whatever.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: Short
stories or editing

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.970 align:middle line:90%
or writing new chapters.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And I've always got a new
book on the back burner.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm plotting one while
I'm writing another one so

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that it's always just
this constant, one

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:42.750 align:middle line:90%
story after another.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do real-life
events, Kevin,

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.950 align:middle line:90%
fuel your ideas for new books?

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: And deadlines do.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have this whole-- like
a back bin of, these are books

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:56.940 align:middle line:90%
that I want to write someday.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I got to tell
you, when I was in college,

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.240 align:middle line:90%
my minor was Russian history.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And Russian history means
all of Russia, Ukraine,

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:90%
the whole Eastern--

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And the
history of Russia

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.150 align:middle line:84%
is just, like, this giant
Shakespearean tragedy.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: There are so
many wonderful things.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And there are great
myths and legends about--

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.520 align:middle line:90%
the Vikings settled Russia.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.830 align:middle line:84%
They came down in, and they
settled Kyiv and Ukraine

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:24.690 align:middle line:90%
and went over.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And the whole story of these
Vikings settling in Kyiv--

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and there's this
multigenerational story

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.930 align:middle line:90%
of this ruling family.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And two years ago I
received an honorary PhD

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:40.260 align:middle line:90%
from the University of Kyiv.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed to go over
there and accept this degree.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:84%
But because of COVID, we had
to cancel the travel plans.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:51.497 align:middle line:84%
And then they still
wanted me to come over.

00:41:51.497 --> 00:41:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which would have
been around this period.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Right.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm watching
the events in Ukraine

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.020 align:middle line:90%
very closely right now.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.780 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, just
about two weeks

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.950 align:middle line:10%
before the first invasion,
I was on a Zoom call

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.800 align:middle line:10%
at the Ukrainian National
Science Fiction Convention.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.210 align:middle line:10%
I was one of their guests.

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.880 align:middle line:10%
And I was talking to them
about their own history

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.095 align:middle line:10%
and their own culture.

00:42:13.095 --> 00:42:13.895 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:42:13.895 --> 00:42:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDERSON: And they were just
over the moon with the idea

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:19.640 align:middle line:84%
that some American writer was
fascinated by their fantasy.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Knew so
much about them.

00:42:21.015 --> 00:42:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:24.390 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDERSON: And now maybe that's
going to influence me to say,

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:25.440 align:middle line:10%
you know, darn it.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to write
this Ukrainian history

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.080 align:middle line:10%
thing finally.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.247 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Kevin, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.510 align:middle line:90%
You did a great job for us.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDERSON: Thank you, George.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your
books are fantastic.

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Pick up a novel.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:36.540 align:middle line:10%
There are many.

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
