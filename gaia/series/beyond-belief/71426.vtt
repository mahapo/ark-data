00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.638 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:26.679 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to this edition

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.259 align:middle line:10%
He is a film producer.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.490 align:middle line:10%
He is an author.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:10%
But he's also a
prophetic investigator.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:10%
Ken Klein is with us.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.044 align:middle line:10%
Ken, what is a
prophetic investigator?

00:00:42.044 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:10%
>>KEN KLEIN: [LAUGHING] Wow.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:10%
That's a good question.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know, I'm
interested in the prophecies

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:10%
of the Old Testament
and many of the things

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:10%
that come out of the
Book of Revelation.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:10%
And for most of
my last 40 years,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:10%
I've been
investigating prophecy.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:90%
It's an interest.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:90%
It's my genetics.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm from a Jewish background.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I got interested in
the prophets 40, 45 years ago.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've been on that
quest for some time

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:84%
now and looking into things
and searching history

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and investigating whether the
things we're being taught today

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:90%
are true or not.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's how
I would characterize

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:84%
what a prophetic
investigator is.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you found
that prophecy is accurate

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
as we look ahead
toward the future?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: I think there are some
things to it that are accurate,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:90%
but a lot of it is inaccurate.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, Jesus said
many false prophets

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:84%
will come in my name
saying these are the times.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of cynical and
skeptical about modern prophets

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.450 align:middle line:90%
and prophecy.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot of it is
just tradition, myth, dogma.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been
looking into a lot

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:84%
of these things over
the last 40, 45 years

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:90%
to see if they're true or not.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ken, what is prophecy?

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.010 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: Well, in
many ways, it's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:90%
a prediction of the future.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what most
people think about prophecy.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it's just
forthtelling, you know,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And prophecy is a difficult
field because most of it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:90%
is not grounded properly.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've
found out as I've

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
studied the prophecies and the
prophets and modern prophets,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:84%
is that they don't
do a good enough job

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:90%
in going back in time.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:84%
John the Revelator, for example,
brought forth revelations.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:84%
But he had a terrific 360 view
of the future and the past.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't somebody that
just looked forward.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
Book of Revelation,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
which most prophecy
teachers come from,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:84%
don't do enough work in seeing
how the past is explained

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
in apocalyptic literature.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think unless you're
grounded in history,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.825 align:middle line:84%
you can go off in
the trees and come up

00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:02.430 align:middle line:90%
with all kinds of theories.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.285 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of my research
is based upon history.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ken, a lot of
civilizations in the past

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:10%
have always thought that
they were in end times,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:10%
that this was it.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:90%
And it never happened.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And we went on to
another civilization

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:90%
and another one and another one.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people today
say we are in end times.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll get your views
on that in a moment.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Where does that stand?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: Well, I think
a lot of the way we

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
talk about end times
is not-- is because we

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:90%
don't understand time.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
There's different time
elements in existence.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, God
dwells in eternity,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:90%
in the heaven above the heavens.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
The heavens are the universe
where all the galaxies are.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:90%
There's a different time there.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a different time than we
conceptualize time on Earth.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:84%
We see time in a
linear capacity.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about end times,
what are we talking about?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking about God's time,
universal time, or Earth time?

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
Book of Revelation

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:84%
has some amazing writings
in it that have never

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:84%
been brought forth,
mysteries that are there

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that the Christian
church has no idea about

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
but are right there
for you to see.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:90%
But they're locked up.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think time is a very
important consideration when

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:84%
you want to talk
about end times.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are these like codes?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: Yes.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:10%
The Book of Revelation is hard
to understand because there's

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:10%
no historical context to it.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:90%
It's basically transcendental.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And so much of the
Book of Revelation

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.070 align:middle line:90%
is encoded in symbolism.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And until you break
the symbolism down,

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:90%
you don't know what's going on.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to almost
recreate history to understand.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I say "recreate,"
I'm not saying invent it.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying
exhume it so that you

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:84%
can see how these
things fall into place.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to do some
of that today with you.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The people we have
had as so-called prophets

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.750 align:middle line:10%
in the past, the Nostradamuses
and those kinds of people,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:10%
were they accurate?

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:10%
What do you think?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: You know, this is
going to sound beyond the pale

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.421 align:middle line:10%
of Christianity--

00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:14.087 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Maybe beyond
belief. [LAUGHING]

00:05:14.087 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: [LAUGHING]
Every human being born,

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:84%
the scriptures say
that he-- God is

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
the light that lighteth every
man that cometh into the world.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Christians
say, well, that's only

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:90%
when you accept Jesus.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.043 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that's
what that's saying.

00:05:29.043 --> 00:05:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I think every person has a
certain spark of divine life

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
in him, because I think
the Bible teaches that.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So people kind of bump
against the ceiling

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and come up with stuff
in every religion.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not endorsing
every-- where they

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:90%
get a fragment of something.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So these guys like
Nostradamus, they

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:90%
may have picked up on some idea.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Like George Lucas
in Star Wars, he

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.980 align:middle line:84%
was obviously picking
up on a theme that's

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:90%
out of the Book of Revelation.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:90%
How did he get that?

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a new
cartoon coming out.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I noticed it this morning as
I was preparing for the show.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Peabody, the dog that
goes back in time.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:90%
He time travels.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.452 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's something
to this time-travel thing.

00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And now it's in a
cartoon, I think.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:90%
So people come up with ideas.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Where are these coming from?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.442 align:middle line:84%
They're coming from the
world of the spirit.

00:06:17.442 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And people don't know
they're picking up on it.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think there
may be something.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:90%
I've never studied Nostradamus.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:84%
But I think everybody
has in their lifetime

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:84%
at least a few experiences
that are supernatural.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.040 align:middle line:10%
I bet you you can tell me
stuff that you went through--

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And I still do.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.123 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: And you still do.

00:06:33.123 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've had some amazing
experiences, things-- you know,

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.664 align:middle line:84%
I was a professional football
player as a defensive back.

00:06:40.664 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who'd you play for?

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.205 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: I played
for the Niners.

00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:90%
And not long.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.892 align:middle line:10%
I got Emmitt-damaged.

00:06:45.892 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:10%
And then I got picked up
by the Houston Oilers.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.433 align:middle line:10%
And the big thing
for a defensive back

00:06:49.433 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:10%
was to intercept the pass
and take it to the house.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:10%
That's the biggest play.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That was it.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: That was it.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:10%
What happened to me was
I got intercepted by God.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.742 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea.

00:06:58.742 --> 00:07:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so a lot of
what's happened to me

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.210 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like a
divine appointment.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:84%
If I have a minute
to tell you about it,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I had this dream where this
woman was looking down at me.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was at my
girlfriend's house.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:90%
And I was waking up.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was about 55, this
woman looking down a me.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's up?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, you've been
in the hospital for 10 days.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.350 align:middle line:90%
And I forgot the dream.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Three months later, I
wake up in the hospital.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.276 align:middle line:84%
I had injured my shoulder
against the New Orleans Saints.

00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And this woman that I'd seen in
the dream three months earlier

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.474 align:middle line:90%
was looking down at me.

00:07:31.474 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, there's
another dimension

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
that I don't know
anything about.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was she a
nurse or something?

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.776 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: No, no.

00:07:35.776 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
She was a lady that I had
met in Las Vegas, Jewish lady

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:90%
and her husband, the Lavages.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And they said, when you
get to Houston, look us up.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.810 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And they were like a
surrogate family for me.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And she was watching over me.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, oh my gosh.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.605 align:middle line:84%
I must have tapped
into another dimension.

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:53.521 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You sure did.

00:07:53.521 --> 00:07:55.597 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: And so
that became like-- I

00:07:55.597 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:84%
said, there's a spiritual
mountain I got to climb.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do that.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.419 align:middle line:84%
Because I came from
a Jewish family.

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:02.075 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know about the Messiah.

00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:90%
I knew nothing.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Three years later, I'm in a
car with these three guys.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And I had come to accept that
Jesus is the King of the Jews

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and he's the Messiah
for the whole world.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm in this car with
these three guys.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
this blinding light

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:90%
came into the car.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.237 align:middle line:90%
And it filled us, our body.

00:08:22.237 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of you?

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: Yeah, every one of us.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like
a physical light.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:90%
It was a spiritual light.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.252 align:middle line:84%
And George, it was the
most incredible experience

00:08:29.252 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:90%
of my whole life.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:90%
To this day nothing's topped it.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.067 align:middle line:84%
And I was so
overwhelmed, I got out

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:90%
of the-- we had to stop the car.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't drive.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
And we were falling
on the ground.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:90%
It was like we were drunk.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't stand up.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:10%
And it was so intense.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:10%
I said, God, please stop.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.377 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to die.

00:08:47.377 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:10%
Because it was so amazing.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: It was awesome.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:10%
And that event was kind of
like the inciting incident

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:10%
of a movie that drives
a movie forward.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:84%
That incident has
given me the energy

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.202 align:middle line:90%
to be a prophetic investigator.

00:08:59.202 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That was
the life-changer.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.365 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: That was the inciting
incident that's been driving me

00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:90%
and will drive me till the end.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this
amazing interception.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
God intercepted me.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And that was the big
moment in my life

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.655 align:middle line:84%
where things began
to really change.

00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you talk
about the Book of Revelation

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and that it's somewhat of a
code-- you know, I've read it.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I've read it a lot, Ken.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
scary aspects to it.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But what I just
haven't pinpointed yet

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:84%
was that time that
you talk about.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:84%
What's the kick-in time
for the Book of Revelation?

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: I think the
most important scripture

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.020 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Revelation
is not known to the world.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.122 align:middle line:90%
And it's in Revelation 10.

00:09:43.122 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.611 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: And this
deals with time.

00:09:45.611 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that before
you read Genesis, anything,

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:84%
you've got to understand
Revelation 10.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's an
astonishing thing to say.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But Genesis is first.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.959 align:middle line:90%
We read it, right?

00:09:55.959 --> 00:09:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: Yes, we read it first.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.587 align:middle line:90%
We read left to right.

00:09:58.587 --> 00:10:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But we should be reading
from right to left,

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:84%
from the Book of
Revelation to Genesis.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Because there's things that
took place before Genesis.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And in the 10th
chapter of Revelation,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
John, who gave us
the revelation,

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:90%
is standing before this angel.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And this angel's got a book
in his hands, a little book.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And out of this book come
these seven thunders.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And John's getting
ready to write it down.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:90%
The angel says no.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to write this down.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Eat the book.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.980 align:middle line:10%
And it'll be sweet to your taste
and bitter to your stomach.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:35.590 align:middle line:10%
And so this little fragment of
insight has to do with time.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look at
these seven thunders,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:84%
what could be the
meaning of this?

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you go
back to Genesis--

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:84%
now you go to Genesis-- you
find that it doesn't say,

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:90%
"In the beginning."

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:90%
It says, "In beginning."

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk
about, the Lord says,

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to start talking.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So in beginning with
the conversation,

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
God, Elohim, had created
the heavens and its matter.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:84%
All translation says
in the beginning God

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:84%
created the heavens
and the Earth.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:10%
But the Earth was
without form, meaning

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.620 align:middle line:10%
it was in some
kind of compaction.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:10%
There was no time.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:10%
You can't have time
unless you have distance.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
If there's no distance,
there's no time.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So everything, all the matter,
all the galaxies, all the Earth

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:90%
had no form.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It was in a compaction
of matter probably

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:90%
about the size of a cup.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.751 align:middle line:90%
Just dense.

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Prior to the Big
Bang, I assume, right?

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: And then God
touched the matter.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.600 align:middle line:90%
And it exploded.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thunder.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:90%
And it thundered forth.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And we find in the Old Testament
that God stretches forth

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.946 align:middle line:90%
the heavens.

00:11:38.946 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, the heavens
are still stretching.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:84%
The scientists are
mapping, they're

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.679 align:middle line:84%
mapping the movement
of the stars.

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:10%
And they're able to
put it in reverse

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:10%
and figure out that the universe
is 15 billion years old.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:10%
I happen to believe the
scientific explanation

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.420 align:middle line:10%
for the Big Bang.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: OK.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:10%
And then it says
that God folds up

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.740 align:middle line:10%
the heavens, the universe,
not his own dimension,

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.870 align:middle line:10%
but the universe,
like a garment.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And in other places it says he
rolls it back up like a scroll.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
We find in the Book of
Peter that the heavens

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:90%
will melt with fervent heat.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And he'll create a new
heavens and a new Earth.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Expand and
contract, right?

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: So the Book of
Genesis is a snapshot

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
of a cycle of time, that
there's an explosion.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.290 align:middle line:90%
It expands.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Then it goes back
into a compaction.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So the Book of Revelation
is telling us there's

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
been seven universes before
this present universes.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.820 align:middle line:10%
We're in the eighth universe.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.330 align:middle line:10%
And so the Book of
Genesis is basically

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:10%
showing a snapshot of this
alpha, omega, alpha, omega--

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:10%
seven preceding universes.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:90%
We're in the eighth one.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the Book of Revelation

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
existence and time,

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.770 align:middle line:84%
universal time is circuitous
where life on Earth is linear.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we need to
begin to approach the Bible,

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.652 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
bigger out there

00:13:01.652 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
that we've never been
able to understand.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And the Book of
Revelation tells us

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
about time and how we're
to understand time and look

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:84%
at things in the
context of time.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.595 align:middle line:84%
So when you get to next
chapter in Revelation,

00:13:15.595 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
the 11th chapter's talking
about this temple that

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.929 align:middle line:84%
has to be built on Earth,
which is what I was telling you

00:13:21.929 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:84%
before that I just got
back from Jerusalem.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:10%
Because it's all about
this third temple that

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:10%
has to be built before
the Messiah comes.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:10%
But in the 12th
chapter we find a war

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:10%
in the heavens, in the universe,
and specifically in our galaxy.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.520 align:middle line:10%
There was a war.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.510 align:middle line:10%
And in that war,
Lucifer, who was

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:10%
an archangel over the
cherubimic order--

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.350 align:middle line:10%
he co-chaired that
with Gabriel--

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:10%
was offered an advancement,
like a vice president,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:10%
like George Bush became
president after Reagan.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:84%
He was offered an advancement
because he did great exploits.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:14:00.254 align:middle line:84%
And that advancement was to
an order called the ophanim.

00:14:00.254 --> 00:14:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And over the
ophanim-- and they're

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.220 align:middle line:84%
talked about in
Ezekiel 1 and 10.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
This was another
group of angels.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.338 align:middle line:90%
There were three.

00:14:06.338 --> 00:14:09.276 align:middle line:84%
There were the cherubim, the
seraphim and the ophanim.

00:14:09.276 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
know about the ophanim.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But over that order
was this thing

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:90%
called the Morning Star Office.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.965 align:middle line:10%
The Morning Star Office is
what Lucifer was elevated to.

00:14:18.965 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he
didn't like that.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Or did he?

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: No.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the ophanim
were these proxies

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:84%
that worked with that
office to create.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.750 align:middle line:90%
They were creator angels.

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:84%
They were just like a
carpenter has co-workers.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.500 align:middle line:84%
You build a foundation--
or a master builder.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.657 align:middle line:90%
You build the foundation.

00:14:42.657 --> 00:14:43.490 align:middle line:90%
You build the walls.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.281 align:middle line:90%
You build the roof.

00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:90%
He subcontracts.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.339 align:middle line:10%
These beings were
subcontractors to this office

00:14:49.339 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:10%
called the Morning Star Office.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Mormons think that
Lucifer was a brother of Jesus

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
because the Morning
Star Office also

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
was attributed unto Jesus
before he came to the Earth.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:84%
He was the Morning Star, head
honcho over these creator

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:90%
angels.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So Lucifer was
elevated to a creator.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And in that creative
office, he screwed up.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.479 align:middle line:84%
And that screw-up caused
this war in Heaven

00:15:15.479 --> 00:15:16.895 align:middle line:84%
that's talked about
in Revelation.

00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, how
did he screw up?

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.190 align:middle line:90%
What did he do?

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: We're
going to have to do

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:84%
another show on
that whole screw-up.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But suffice it to say he
was privy to creator codes.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look at
something like cancer--

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:84%
have you ever looked at a
cancer DNA and the cells?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.984 align:middle line:90%
They're very symmetrical.

00:15:33.984 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:90%
They're very creative.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're organized.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:36.915 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: They're organized.

00:15:36.915 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Who created that?

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.631 align:middle line:90%
God didn't do that.

00:15:39.631 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:10%
That creative design was by
Lucifer to afflict humanity.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:10%
Because he-- when he
was judged for what

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:10%
he did-- because he came
before a supreme court

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:10%
of the universe.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was decided that
he would have to vacate.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Because of the war he
started in the heavens,

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
he would have to
vacate his body,

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:84%
because he had a
magnificent body.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
He had-- it says his
pipes, vocal cords,

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
he could sing better
than Whitney Houston,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:90%
my favorite singer.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.930 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: But was he human type?

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: Well, no, he wasn't--

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
talk about a body,

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of a
physical structure.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: He had an
angel body that's

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:84%
described in the
Book of Ezekiel.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.768 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An angel body.

00:16:18.768 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: Yeah, angel body that
was beyond what we can imagine.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And he was commanded
to be cast out of it

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.370 align:middle line:90%
and thrown down to this Earth.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And he is called in the
Bible the god of this world.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And in this world he
creates codes, you know.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And those codes are
mentioned in my book.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:44.544 align:middle line:84%
My book is a manual on-- it's
like when we played football--

00:16:44.544 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which one
are we talking about?

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:90%
This one?

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.806 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: The "False
Prophet" book.

00:16:47.806 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:10%
But that's kind of like
a manual on what he's

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:10%
been doing on the Earth
for thousands of years.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're expressed in codes
in the Book of Revelation.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So he's a creator,
a twisted creator.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And so his plan that's
explained in the 13th chapter

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
is to create these
political entities

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning of
the Egyptian Empire all

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:18.839 align:middle line:90%
the way to the end of the world.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.270 align:middle line:10%
And so he's been
working on a plan

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:10%
to capture humanity
for thousands of years.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, when you
look at these images,

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
you have to see that
he is a code creator.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.787 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How's he doing?

00:17:32.787 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: He's doing
a pretty good job.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.661 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's what I thought.

00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:36.580 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: Yeah.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.670 align:middle line:10%
And the world is
falling more and more

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:10%
under his spell
and unaware of it.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll get more into
those specific codes.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And precisely, you know,
especially the most

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:84%
talked about thing that he's
been doing and will be doing--

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and he has been doing it-- is
the mark of the beast reality.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:10%
I want to get into some
detail about that as we go.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:10%
But the most important thing
out of what we've talked about

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:10%
is that when he used
creativity to pull off

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:10%
what he wanted to do, which
was to ascend above the clouds.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.620 align:middle line:84%
The Milky Way is basically--
it's called Milky

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:90%
because it looks like a cloud.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to ascend above not
the terrestrial clouds that we

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.760 align:middle line:84%
see, but the clouds of the
universal construction.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
That's when he got
into real trouble.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what caused
the war to break out.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what caused
this supreme court, which

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%
is called the seven spirits
of God in Revelation 1 and 2,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
to convene and say,
OK, you're going

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:90%
to have to vacate your body.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.209 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
have to be-- eventually

00:18:42.209 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to take on human form.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:10%
And he said, no, I'm
not doing none of that.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.519 align:middle line:10%
I didn't do any-- he protested.

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had the
right to protest?

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: He had the right
to protest on legal grounds.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:90%
And he filed an appeal.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:90%
There's an appeal.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.660 align:middle line:90%
It has to be heard.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:84%
The appeal has to be heard
by the court of heaven.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's the judge?

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: The judge
will be witnesses

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and the supreme council
of the universe, which

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.590 align:middle line:90%
are seven spirits of God.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:84%
It will convene-- it's
called the great white throne

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:90%
judgment.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.799 align:middle line:84%
And that's where a lot
of people think, well,

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:15.590 align:middle line:84%
that's where all the
humans will be judged.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
this appellate court

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:84%
hearing is over the
arguments that he

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
wants to make that he
didn't do anything wrong,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.539 align:middle line:84%
that he was given
the authority and he

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:90%
didn't do anything wrong.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And so he has been,
in the interim,

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:90%
thrown down to the Earth.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And he's trying to make his
case by proving that he didn't

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
do anything wrong by
winning people away from God

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:90%
to himself.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's doing a good job of
it on this planet for sure.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
to understand that he

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
moved from the angelic
office of the cherubim, which

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:90%
were the basic watchers.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.620 align:middle line:10%
You know, when you see Indiana
Jones with the angel standing

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.100 align:middle line:10%
over the Ark of
the Covenant, those

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.640 align:middle line:10%
are cherubimic representations
of these covering angels

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:10%
that are watchers.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:84%
The seraphim angels
are the scribes.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
They're the keepers of the
records of the universes.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said
there's seven thunders,

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:84%
that the circuitous activity of
the universe, where it expands,

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:90%
goes back.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting ready-- I
don't know how many millennium

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
are ahead of us-- but where
everything reverses and goes

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:90%
back into a compaction.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why it says he'll make
a new heavens and a new Earth.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's not--
this heavens isn't

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:10%
going to be
miraculously renovated.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:10%
It's going to go back
into a compaction.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So God uses the same matter
to make new universes.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:84%
It's phenomenal that he's
a lot bigger than I ever--

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So is Lucifer going
to win in the long run?

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: Lucifer is not
going to win in the long run.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Because there'll be
a return of Christ.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And the brightness
of his coming will

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:90%
arrest all of the darkness.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be a binding of
this horrific angel, fallen

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:84%
angel, for-- it
says 1,000 years.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not so sure that's a
literal 1,000 years as maybe

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that's the number of-- one of
the completion numbers of God.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
It may be a lot longer
than 1,000 years.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But that's when we'll
have a whole new reality

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle line:84%
But before that
can happen, there

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.864 align:middle line:84%
has to be a rebuilding of the
Jewish temple in Jerusalem.

00:21:33.864 --> 00:21:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that being done?

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Is there any possibilities
of that happening?

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:44.111 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: Right now the Jews
believe that the temple--

00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:84%
they believe that there
is to be a third temple.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's not as widespread
as it needs to be.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
organizations in Israel

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that believe it to be
a necessity according

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:90%
to the prophets.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:90%
The prophets predict this.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.060 align:middle line:10%
But they think it goes
on the Temple Mount.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:02.747 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:02.747 --> 00:22:05.330 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: Where the Dome of the
Rock is and the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:10%
The all-- the world
believes this.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:10%
But we've proven 100%--

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You don't think so.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: No way.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.580 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't belong up there.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we did this
new film called "The Temple

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.555 align:middle line:90%
and the End of the Age."

00:22:16.555 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So that temple
has to be rebuilt.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.027 align:middle line:84%
But as long as the Jews
insist and the world--

00:22:21.027 --> 00:22:22.485 align:middle line:84%
the Christians
believe it, too-- it

00:22:22.485 --> 00:22:23.901 align:middle line:84%
goes up where the
Dome of the Rock

00:22:23.901 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:84%
is or near the Al-Aqsa
Mosque, it won't happen.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the temple was built
over the City of David,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
which is just about 600 feet
south of the southern wall.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's in
this geographical area?

00:22:36.165 --> 00:22:36.748 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: Yeah.

00:22:36.748 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Because old Jerusalem, during
the time of King David,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:84%
was not where those
walls are today.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:84%
It was built where
the Jebusite city was.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And David conquered that.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It was right over this water
supply called the Gihon.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:90%
And they had to have that water.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:51.690 align:middle line:90%
They had to have the water--

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But this temple must be built
before these other things are

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:54.870 align:middle line:90%
going to kick in?

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:55.453 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: Yeah.

00:22:55.453 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:90%
It has to be rebuilt.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Because several
things have to happen.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.357 align:middle line:84%
And there's two
temples mentioned.

00:23:01.357 --> 00:23:02.940 align:middle line:84%
There's one in the
Book of Revelation,

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:90%
in the 11th chapter.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's one in the Book of
Ezekiel, Chapter 40 through 48.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.840 align:middle line:84%
The Ezekiel temple is
built by the Messiah.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:90%
He's going to do that himself.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's in a 40-acre square.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.190 align:middle line:90%
40 by 40, it's actually.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:20.292 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's there now?

00:23:20.292 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: Nothing.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just the city.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Jerusalem has expanded.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we could be
talking about how long?

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: Well, it depends.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:90%
It depends.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where
time comes in again.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.233 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: Yeah, it depends.

00:23:34.233 --> 00:23:36.520 align:middle line:10%
It could be hundreds
of years off.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.189 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:37.189 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: But you
know, I'm believing

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to
be sooner than that.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think the film
that we produced,

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.690 align:middle line:84%
if it finds traction amongst
the people in Israel--

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:84%
we were just over there, and
we had tremendous, tremendous

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.150 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So something
supernatural is going on.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite a chore to
convince these people that

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
for 380 years have believed
the temple goes up there.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.436 align:middle line:84%
But prior to the
12th century, no Jews

00:24:04.436 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:84%
believed that the
temple went up there.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
The greatest Jewish
luminary, Maimonides,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.230 align:middle line:84%
said, up until my
time, no structure's

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:90%
been built on the Temple Mount.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.298 align:middle line:10%
Well, he couldn't
have been talking

00:24:15.298 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:10%
about what they consider
the Temple Mount today,

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:10%
because Helena built
a church up there.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Justinian built a
church up there.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.688 align:middle line:84%
Omar built the Al-Aqsa
Mosque up there.

00:24:24.688 --> 00:24:26.146 align:middle line:84%
And the Dome of
the Rock-- there've

00:24:26.146 --> 00:24:27.590 align:middle line:90%
been four buildings up there.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So he must have been talking
about a different Temple Mount.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are you
concerned, Ken, at all

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:10%
about the Book of Revelation?

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything in it
that would bother you

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:42.240 align:middle line:90%
as an expert on prophecy?

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: Well, I
think, when you--

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean because--

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: Well, let
me-- I'll tell you

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.060 align:middle line:90%
something that bothers me.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the one thing
that bothers me.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid,
but I'm bothered.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:84%
When the British
Empire ruled the world,

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and they were disbanded
because of their opium

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:04.010 align:middle line:84%
destruction of the Chinese
and they controlled India,

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.330 align:middle line:84%
the East India House,
which was their army,

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:84%
was disbanded because
the world hated

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:84%
what they were
doing to the world.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:84%
But the intelligence of
that group went underground.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
They became known as
the Chatham House.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Today they're known
as the Royal Institute

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:90%
of International Affairs.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And in that organization,
there was a guy

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Thomas Malthus.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And he was the father of
race science and eugenetics.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of his teachings
landed in the United States.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And one place it landed
was Cal Berkeley.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And these people
believe that in order

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to have an orderful
planet, they have

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:90%
to kill off quite a few people.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:10%
And they want to
reduce the population--

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Down to
500 million, right?

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.710 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: 500 million.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the Book
of Revelation, it

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.300 align:middle line:84%
talks about the population
being culled by a third and then

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.990 align:middle line:90%
by another third.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm bothered by
what I see historically

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:84%
in race sciences and
how it's proliferated

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.640 align:middle line:84%
to some very wealthy
people that think that this

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:84%
is a solution for how to
have an orderful planet.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So that's possible.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.390 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: Definitely possible.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear
about these chemtrails

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and how they're
spraying us, and when

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:27.350 align:middle line:84%
you hear about these
different transgenics

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and how they're using
this food, that they're

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.429 align:middle line:90%
manipulating the DNA of food.

00:26:33.429 --> 00:26:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: GMO.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: GMO food.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And something's going on
that we're not understanding.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, I was just
listening to a great radio

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
show the other day
of an earthquake that

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.317 align:middle line:84%
happened in Virginia
about a few years ago.

00:26:48.317 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:90%
He said, that was no earthquake.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.055 align:middle line:84%
That was an underground
city collapsing.

00:26:52.055 --> 00:26:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And he's talked
about how the CIA has

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.874 align:middle line:90%
developed underground cities.

00:26:56.874 --> 00:26:58.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Some
people believe that.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.720 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: And I think it's true.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:04.420 align:middle line:10%
And so there's something
going on that we can't see.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And even the war in
the Middle East now,

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:84%
in Syria, they're saying
is a CIA-run operation

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:90%
with these Sunnis.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Watch on TV.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
They're right driving
military Humvees and tanks.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And some of the weaponry you
see, that's all American.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Like what is going on?

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot going on
that most human beings aren't

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:90%
paying attention to.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
might have something

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.940 align:middle line:84%
to do with the culling
of the population.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it all
geared to prophecy?

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: Yes, it has to
do with prophecy and stuff

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:84%
that-- you know, you
say, are you bothered?

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.276 align:middle line:90%
I am bothered.

00:27:36.276 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid,
but I'm bothered.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is it fixable, Ken?

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:40.590 align:middle line:10%
Can we stop it?

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:41.317 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: No.

00:27:41.317 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You can't stop the bad.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: We can't stop it.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:90%
It is written.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:90%
It is done.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.700 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that can stop
all of this wickedness and evil

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:90%
is the return of the Messiah.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:54.990 align:middle line:90%
And he'll put an end to it.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if I read
Revelation correctly,

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.107 align:middle line:90%
eventually we're going to be OK.

00:28:00.107 --> 00:28:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: Absolutely.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But until
we get to that point,

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be a mess.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: It's downhill.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.850 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely downhill.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
you can really

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
do is not let it overly
trouble you or bother you,

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.740 align:middle line:90%
is to walk with God.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:90%
And he'll protect you.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a divine
protection over his elect.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.547 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not
afraid of it for me.

00:28:22.547 --> 00:28:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I worry about it for
my grandchildren,

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:25.664 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
know what decisions

00:28:25.664 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:90%
they're going to make.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.496 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's going
to happen to them, sure.

00:28:28.496 --> 00:28:34.200 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: But as long as people
seek God, he'll protect them.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.850 align:middle line:10%
But the political world is going
to come-- it's in a shambles.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.090 align:middle line:90%
We can't fix it.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.640 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ken, if people want
more information on you--

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:10%
>>KLEIN: They can go to my
website, kenkleinproductions,

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:50.120 align:middle line:10%
plural, .net,
kenkleinproductions.net.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.572 align:middle line:84%
They can probably Google my
name and click on my name.

00:28:52.572 --> 00:28:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It'll take you
right to my website.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.810 align:middle line:90%
That's easy, K-L-E-I-N.

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.199 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Big change
from the football days.

00:28:58.199 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: I've been intercepted.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.844 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
went the distance.

00:29:03.844 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KLEIN: So far.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:90%
I still got some ways to go.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
hopeful for the future?

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KLEIN: I'm very hopeful
for the future for me.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not happy and I'm
saddened by what's

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.057 align:middle line:90%
coming upon the world.

00:29:18.057 --> 00:29:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Understand.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Understand.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.500 align:middle line:10%
Well, stay tuned
to another edition

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.880 align:middle line:10%
of "Beyond Belief"
where Ken Klein talks

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:10%
about the sign of the beast.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.420 align:middle line:10%
What does that
mean to all of us?

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
