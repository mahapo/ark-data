>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.813 --> 00:00:09.020 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.664 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.170 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: The
Book of Revelation.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:10%
Planet X. Is it
all tied together?

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory with our
special guest researcher

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and noted author
Marshall Masters,

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.850 align:middle line:84%
who has devoted a number
of years to investigating

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of a planetary
system that is included

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system
that consists

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.580 align:middle line:84%
of three extra planets
and a brown dwarf star.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:84%
A star system, a
binary star system,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.230 align:middle line:84%
within our own
solar system that,

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Marshall, a lot of
astronomers would

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.050 align:middle line:84%
agree that there could very
well be this other brown dwarf

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.372 align:middle line:90%
star in our solar system.

00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:10%
>>MARSHALL MASTERS:
You know, we're

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:10%
seeing what we
call foreshadowing.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:10%
And they're slowly introducing
the concept to the public.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:10%
And I think astronomers have
to show a tremendous amount

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:10%
of courage in order to talk
about this because Robert

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:10%
Harrington was an astronomer,
US Naval Observatory.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And many of us who
research in the field

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:84%
believe he was assassinated
for his work on Planet X. He

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:90%
got a little too close to it.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:10%
And you know, also
since then we have

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:10%
seen a lot of deep
space astronomers dying

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.772 align:middle line:10%
really bizarre mystery deaths.

00:01:39.772 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Strange.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.717 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Inordinary amount.

00:01:43.717 --> 00:01:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Oh, yeah.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're just
not dying, cancer

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:90%
with the family around them.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, weird things.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Car crashes?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Car crashes,
airplanes flying too low

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.802 align:middle line:90%
and hitting cable cars.

00:01:55.802 --> 00:01:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, man.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: I mean,
it is really bizarre.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that, yeah,
it's a third rail topic.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:90%
They have to be careful.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, I get a
lot of heat all the time.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of interference.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:84%
People do not realize how much
that there really is out there.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:84%
There are paid
disinformation teams.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And they come principally
out of the city-states,

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:84%
which is going to be the crown
in London, the Vatican in Rome,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and then of course
Washington, DC.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Our book, "2012 Planet X" was
actually-- the Italian language

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:84%
edition was by order of the
Vatican removed from store

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:90%
shelves in Italy and burnt.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Vatican has
a couple observatories.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:90%
I find that weird.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: I find it brilliant
because the one that they have

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.367 align:middle line:90%
in Southeast Arizona--

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:10%
Mount Graham?

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:10%
If you wanted the right
instrument at the right place

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:10%
to have the longest duration
observation of the flyby,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.480 align:middle line:10%
that's it.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:10%
And they've got the
right telescope.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, I
mean, what are they

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
doing edging into basically
a university system

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and forcing themselves
into the scene?

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's do a quick review
on this extra star system.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin called it,
of course, the 12th planet.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:84%
You believe there are three
planets and the brown dwarf

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:90%
star.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.345 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:90%
We call it the Planet X system.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:10%
It's a constellation that's
inside our solar system.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's in what's a comet-like
orbit, 3,600 lunar years coming

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:10%
around.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.110 align:middle line:10%
Right now it is come
up from behind the sun.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:10%
It's going towards its
point of perihelion.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:10%
That's its closest distance
to the sun, so it has to slow.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:10%
Imagine you're in an amusement
park, the ride that's

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:10%
called "The Whip."

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And you got the big
turnbuckles on each end.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:10%
And you have the
long ride, where

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:10%
you try and look
interested for everyone

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:10%
but you're really bored.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
to the turnbuckle

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and you whip around
and whoopee, OK?

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's exactly
the same thing

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:90%
that's happening right here.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
When it hits that
point of perihelion,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:84%
where it's closest to the
sun, and when that happens,

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.662 align:middle line:84%
we're going to call it
the "Triangle of Death."

00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what we refer
to it, because we'll

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:90%
see Nemesis and its planets.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally just going
to look like a triangle.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And when we see that, that is
really the beginning of woes.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see it coming
out from behind the sun.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Once it comes out
from behind the sun--

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're
talking about soon?

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Soon.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: And it is going
to speed up dramatically

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:10%
as it goes out into the system.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:10%
And it'll fly over
Earth's orbit.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And so this is really what we
believe the Mayans were talking

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:90%
about with December 21, 2012.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.935 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for when
is the guacamole going

00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:90%
to hit the fan.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.144 align:middle line:84%
Was the flood of
Noah related to this?

00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:90%
It was the third previous flyby.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we have
what we call a best scenario,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:90%
worst scenario.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:84%
A best scenario is when
Nemesis is crossing

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:84%
our orbit, Earth's orbit--
we are on the opposite side

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:90%
of the sun.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:90%
That's best case.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
That was the last
flyby, which was

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Exodus, Ten Plagues of Exodus.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:90%
And that was a global event.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:84%
The deluge was a
worst case event.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
We were on the same
side of the sun

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:84%
when Nemesis was
crossing our orbit.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, this flyby
is a worst case scenario.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:10%
And that was I think
very accurately

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.114 align:middle line:10%
called by Bob Dean on a Project
Camelot interview in 2008.

00:05:42.114 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: All right,
Marshall, let's talk

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:10%
about some possible
events that could

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:10%
occur because of this flyby.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Event one you call
the "Winter of Ash."

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: The Winter
of Ash is what's

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.310 align:middle line:84%
going to tell us
we're on the timeline.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the harbinger.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:10%
We're already seeing a lot of
volcanic activity increasing

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:10%
worldwide.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:10%
The Ring of Fire, there's a
serious uptick in seismicity.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And what's going
to happen with this

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
is that on the western
edge of the Ring of Fire,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.112 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have volcanoes
popping off all over the place.

00:06:14.112 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's starting too.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.159 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: That's
absolutely starting.

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Kilauea is heating up.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:10%
Things are happening all around.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.620 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.150 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.736 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Chile
has one happening.

00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Yeah.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:10%
You got it.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:10%
And this is going to be
an important harbinger

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:10%
in the sense we're not going
to see a major loss of life.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:90%
This is really the warning.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On event one.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: On event one.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:10%
This is really
telling everybody,

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:10%
get off the dime,
start doing something.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And what we will see is
more economic and political.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have these
volcanoes popping off.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:84%
They're putting a lot
of ash into the sky.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:84%
That's going to shut
down air traffic.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It's also going to cover
a lot of farm fields.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So what will happen
is, what we're

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
going to see from this
side of the Pacific

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to
see ash coming.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:90%
That's going to cover us.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to be
a real serious problem.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:90%
But we're going to see that.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But what we're also going to
see are shortages in the stores,

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:84%
because with farming
being closed down

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
on the western side of the
Pacific, the foods we're

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
importing right now from
China and from South America

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and other places,
they're going to go where

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.899 align:middle line:90%
they can get the most money.

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.273 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: And so
those ships are just

00:07:33.273 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:84%
going to be turned towards
that area of the world.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to see
shortages on our shelves here.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Marshall, this
visitation kind of reminds

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
me of that 2000 movie
"Knowing" with Nicolas Cage.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at the trailer,

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.480 align:middle line:84%
because I think that sets
the stage for a lot of things

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.566 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: All right.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.565 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look.

00:07:54.565 --> 00:07:57.976 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:57.976 --> 00:08:19.047 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.047 --> 00:08:19.630 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:90%
That's scary, Marshall.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's real, isn't it?

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: It's a
real possibility.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I think in this flyby we
have a good chance that there

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.990 align:middle line:84%
for the grace of God, that
we will miss something

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:90%
like that hitting us.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:84%
But it definitely-- the
next time this system

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
comes around, there's
absolutely no question about it.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:90%
It is a "Knowing" event.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But what we are
going to have here

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
something akin to that.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:84%
We are going to have what Ed
Dames calls the "killshot"--

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
solar storms, massive,
massive x and y--

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constant, right?

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:90%
No breath, just boom.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Boom, boom, boom.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is when during
this tribulation period

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:84%
you've got to know
to go to dirt, OK?

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.840 align:middle line:84%
In my book, one of
my books, we have

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:84%
this is how much dirt you
need over your head, or steel,

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you have.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:84%
In general, when you're
looking for a place to survive,

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
there's three
things I recommend.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
One, rolling hills, soft
earth, and lots of water.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK,

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.027 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Water is life.

00:09:27.027 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: You don't have water,
I don't care what you got.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: California
is in trouble already.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Is the drought in California
related to this system?

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Actually, I think
it's related indirectly.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the geo-engineering
that's going on.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.440 align:middle line:90%
They're moving the jet stream.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.631 align:middle line:90%
Remember the old--

00:09:43.631 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
right in the middle.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
It was right in the
middle of the country.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Came right in through
the Golden Gate.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.331 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yup.

00:09:49.331 --> 00:09:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: OK.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Twain said the
coldest winter I ever spent

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:90%
was a summer in San Francisco.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: I lived there.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.223 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, that
Sinatra song, right?

00:09:58.223 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:90%
The lady's a tramp.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I could never
understand because I've

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
been in California since 2003,
and it's pretty darn warm

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.565 align:middle line:90%
to me in most cases.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.481 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I could never
understand the song where he

00:10:10.481 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:90%
said it's cold and it's damp.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.881 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying,
wait a minute.

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:84%
You sound like you're
talking about the Midwest.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
you're talking about.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.431 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Exactly.

00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they did was
they geo-engineered it.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
The jet stream comes
down then dips up.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:90%
It goes over British Columbia.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I have people
reporting to me that

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.280 align:middle line:84%
live up in British
Columbia, same thing

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.752 align:middle line:84%
here in Truckee,
California, where

00:10:35.752 --> 00:10:37.210 align:middle line:84%
they should be in
the winter having

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:90%
four to six feet of snow.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Last January, I
was in Truckee, California.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was on a road that
had the stakes on the side

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.145 align:middle line:84%
for plowing the snow
with all the reflectors.

00:10:49.145 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.082 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: There was nothing.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing there.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Nothing
on the ground.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It shifted.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.265 align:middle line:90%
Everything's shifted.

00:10:54.265 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Everything
is shifted.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why folks
in the Midwest are getting what

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.921 align:middle line:84%
they call wet snow and all this
bizarre-- because they're--

00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Boston got
a lot of snow this year.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It never stopped.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: They're
geo-engineering.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Event two, called
the "Covert Visitation,"

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.290 align:middle line:90%
what is that?

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Covert
Visitation, this

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.235 align:middle line:84%
is when the Annunaki are going
to come to the world leaders.

00:11:16.235 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:10%
What they're going to
tell them is that there

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:10%
is an asteroid coming your way.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh my gosh.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.049 align:middle line:10%
So we've got this
issue too, an asteroid?

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah, we have.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:90%
And this one--

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In addition to
that planetary system

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:90%
we've been talking about?

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Right.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.155 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to get pelted
by rocks all throughout this.

00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.375 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: All right?

00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:34.494 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
reasons why people have got

00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:35.660 align:middle line:90%
to be able to get to ground.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Get eight feet of
dirt over your head.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, you can get
through the solar storms.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
The smaller impacts
you'll survive.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:84%
This big one is really--
it's the movie "Deep Impact."

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.322 align:middle line:90%
It's just a perfect correlation.

00:11:51.322 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is event
number three, you call.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.905 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:11:53.905 --> 00:11:55.394 align:middle line:90%
That's the "Deep Impact" event.

00:11:55.394 --> 00:11:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the Annunaki
are going to make a deal

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.820 align:middle line:84%
our leaders can't refuse, and
they're going to refuse it.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.281 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the deal?

00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: I don't know.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:90%
The guides didn't tell us that.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.574 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Information?

00:12:07.574 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Protection?

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: I think
it would be probably

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:90%
a change of management.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think whoever's running
the planet here is not

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.452 align:middle line:90%
going to want to step aside.

00:12:18.452 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course not.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: And so
they're figuring

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that this thing's
going to hit probably

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:30.570 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in the south Atlantic,
near between South America

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:90%
and Africa.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:84%
But where this
thing actually hits

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
in the research we
did with the guides,

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:84%
it hits off of the
coast of Europe.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And literally the
point where it hits,

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.044 align:middle line:84%
it's just almost as
though it's targeted

00:12:47.044 --> 00:12:48.335 align:middle line:90%
when we started researching it.

00:12:48.335 --> 00:12:50.001 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the
tsunami goes which way?

00:12:50.001 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Both ways.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.269 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a wall of
water smashing into Europe.

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:55.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the forward.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It will wipe them out.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:10%
Then it's going to
trigger one that comes,

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:10%
and it hits our east coast.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But then America gets
hit with a one-two punch

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
because what is going to happen
is this thing-- when it hits,

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
it hits on the western
edge of the Eurasian Plate.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
That is going to set off Las
Palmas, La Cumbre de Vieja.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.882 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is a
tsunami area if that goes.

00:13:21.882 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Bingo.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've
studied that a lot.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That goes.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And then what
happens is literally

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.470 align:middle line:84%
we have two massive
walls of water hitting.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to-- all the way
from Florida to Nova Scotia.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: It is
going to take out--

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hundreds of
miles inland it will hit.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how big do you
think the tsunami will be?

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:90%
How high?

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:90%
A mile?

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: A mile.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:44.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:90%
It could very well--

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That'll take every
building in New York out.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: It's going to take
out buildings in New York.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know the
remote viewers,

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Ed Dames-- his remote viewers
back in the early 2000 time,

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.950 align:middle line:84%
they were seeing Washington,
DC, under a few hundred feet

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.570 align:middle line:90%
of water.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Event number four
you call the "Perihelion."

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Perihelion,
that is when the Planet X

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:84%
System comes out completely
from behind the sun.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, we
know the next thing that's

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
going to be coming
is we're going

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.142 align:middle line:90%
to have the Annunaki visiting.

00:14:22.142 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:90%
They're going to come--

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.561 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
event number five.

00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: That's
event number five.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have--

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Annunaki Arrive."

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: The Annunaki Arrive.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
want gold and women.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.170 align:middle line:84%
The gold-- we use aluminum
for our geo-engineering.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They have no women?

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Well now, they want
the women for slave breeding.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that part of the
genetic manipulation we're

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.560 align:middle line:90%
seeing with abduction cases?

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Could very well
be because they're not

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:90%
going to be alone.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
There are other species
that are working with them.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We look
like them, don't we?

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.539 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When God
made us in his image,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:90%
it was the Annunaki, wasn't it?

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:10%
>>MASTERS: It was actually,
we come from the loins

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:10%
of Lord Enki of the Annunaki.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you read the Lost
Book of Enki-- Sitchin

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.560 align:middle line:84%
did-- if you like
Game of Thrones,

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
it's Game of Thrones with
horny aliens in spaceships.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.405 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:15:14.405 --> 00:15:15.405 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: I mean, but--

00:15:15.405 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is weird.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:16.336 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Whoa.

00:15:16.336 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:90%
It lays it out.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.520 align:middle line:10%
And they went to great
lengths to engineer us

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:10%
a slave species to mine gold.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why
when we get gold fever,

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:90%
we completely lose it.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:90%
So that's what they do.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
They create species
or dominate them.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.290 align:middle line:90%
They're going to come.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.120 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
leave the planet

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:84%
with most of our refined
gold, 98% of it or more.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:90%
They're going to take women.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be looking
for young women that are

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:90%
suitable for breeding programs.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of other
nasty things going on.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Around this time
we'll see the United

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Nations will pass
enabling legislation

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:58.760 align:middle line:90%
for assisted suicide.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.139 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it'll be
euthanasia on demand.

00:16:03.139 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:90%
You won't even have to be sick.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:84%
You just walk into--
and I mean, this really

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.712 align:middle line:84%
goes to a Soylent
Green scenario.

00:16:09.712 --> 00:16:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, yes.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Know that movie well.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And so as a matter of fact,
in the book the guides tell us

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:23.250 align:middle line:84%
the phrase people will
use is "taking the blade."

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
If you see the movie "Cloud
Atlas," in "Cloud Atlas,"

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:84%
there's a device they
put over the head.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.862 align:middle line:84%
It has a pneumatic
surgical blade.

00:16:30.862 --> 00:16:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That goes
into you, right?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: And just right in.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:35.071 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:16:35.071 --> 00:16:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Venus Impact."

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:90%
What is that event?

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: When the moon
Ferrada-- and Ferrada

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:84%
is a moon of
Nibiru-- it is going

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:84%
to impact the southern
hemisphere of Venus.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get showered
with debris from that.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But that's also letting
us know that the flyby,

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
the days of darkness,
is going to be imminent.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.380 align:middle line:84%
What happens is Nibiru's about
four times the size of Earth.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:06.569 align:middle line:84%
It is going to pass
between us and the sun

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:08.329 align:middle line:84%
in its orbit around
Nemesis, which

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:90%
is going to be way behind us.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.109 align:middle line:84%
This is within the short--
we're talking near history here.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: And in the Bible,
you have the days of darkness

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:90%
that are prophesied.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why it's
dark is because this thing's

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.082 align:middle line:84%
so big it's going to
completely blot out the sun.

00:17:26.082 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's going
to be a weird time.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: It is going
to be a horrifying time.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And you know, this is
when literally people who

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:84%
are fear-based-- the
Egyptians tell us

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:42.070 align:middle line:84%
all about this in what they
call the "Great Winnowing."

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And what the Egyptians explain--
this in the Kolbrin Bible--

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
that basically
whatever's in your heart

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.660 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
amplified a hundredfold.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:84%
If you have fear in
your heart, that fear

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
amplified a hundredfold.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.371 align:middle line:90%
You are going to die of fright.

00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:57.820 align:middle line:90%
You're just like a light bulb.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.137 align:middle line:90%
Flicker, flicker, gone.

00:17:59.137 --> 00:17:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: OK.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Finished.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: On the other hand,
if what you have in your heart

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.152 align:middle line:84%
is love, you're in a state
of love, you're doing better.

00:18:06.152 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not talking
about singing in the pews.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a grandmother
who pulls together some orphans

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.792 align:middle line:84%
and says, kids, let's
hold hands and sing old--

00:18:15.792 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kumbaya.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Kumbaya, whatever.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.146 align:middle line:84%
And the kids are--
in other words,

00:18:19.146 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:90%
they're in a state of love.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Event seven, the
"Annunaki Leave Again."

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.221 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: The Annunaki
will leave just before--

00:18:27.221 --> 00:18:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As they
did the first time.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: They're going to
know when the days of darkness

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:32.690 align:middle line:90%
are going to come.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
They've got to get back
to their planet anyway.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.068 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be a
rough time for them.

00:18:36.068 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well now, does this
visitation of these planets

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:90%
affect those planets too?

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the reason why the
Annunaki need the gold,

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and they keep
coming back for it.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we're
running out of gold.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: They repaired
their atmosphere once.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We don't
have that much left.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Oh, no.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.640 align:middle line:90%
We have oodles of gold.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we
have-- there's a mining

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:90%
engineer I know in Reno.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And he already has a
developed technology,

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and they started-- it gets
10 times as much gold out

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:90%
of the same ore.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they leave?

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: They leave.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:90%
They've got to bug out.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:84%
They've got to get home
because the days of darkness

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:84%
are going to be a
rough one for them too.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:84%
That is going to tear their
atmosphere as well as it

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:90%
tears our atmosphere.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens is
that system is moving.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's moving
counter to our orbit.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.110 align:middle line:90%
So we're going one way.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:84%
The Planet X System is
going the other way.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And what will happen
is that there's

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
going to be a lithosphere
lock, not just a single body,

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to be Nemesis
and Arboda and Helion

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
objects, Nibiru.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:90%
They're going to--

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lots going on.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.280 align:middle line:90%
A lot's going on.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.900 align:middle line:90%
They get a lithosphere lock.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.009 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be an
event we call "Lurch Day."

00:19:52.009 --> 00:19:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.377 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:19:53.377 --> 00:19:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Lurch day
is when everybody

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:84%
knows the pole
shift has started,

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:84%
because when that
lithosphere lock happens,

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.240 align:middle line:84%
that gravitational
hold takes place,

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:84%
the whole planet is
going to shudder.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to then
start-- our spinning

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:90%
is going to start slowing.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.697 align:middle line:84%
And here again, for years
I said, well, I just never

00:20:14.697 --> 00:20:15.780 align:middle line:90%
thought that would happen.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:90%
It is going to happen.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.170 align:middle line:90%
We are going to stop spinning.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:23.957 align:middle line:84%
Our magnetosphere is going to
fail down to maybe 5% to 10%

00:20:23.957 --> 00:20:24.540 align:middle line:90%
of what it is.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could be the worst
of the things that happen--

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:26.912 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:20:26.912 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --if we stop spinning.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Because
we are going to be--

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:90%
we are going to be wide open.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
We won't have a
magnetosphere to defend us.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And now you're talking a minor
flare could be devastating.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:44.095 align:middle line:84%
So then what will happen is
as the lithosphere is just

00:20:44.095 --> 00:20:45.470 align:middle line:84%
going to pull us,
and we're going

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:84%
to actually start spinning
the opposite direction.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.464 align:middle line:84%
And the sun will begin
to rise in the west.

00:20:51.464 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The next
event you talked about

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:90%
was "Days of Darkness."

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Is that the three days
you were mentioning?

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: That's
the three days.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.189 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

00:21:00.189 --> 00:21:01.230 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to see?

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to see temperatures
plummet for three days?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: I think this one
is going to be a hot flyby.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: It's not
going to be cold.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, it makes me
wonder, to be honest,

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:84%
with all the geo-engineering
that we're seeing now happening

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
in our skies, if what
they're really trying to do

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.605 align:middle line:84%
is trigger a mini ice
age to buffer that.

00:21:21.605 --> 00:21:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: Because we're
going to go into a really--

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some believe
we're in one now.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:90%
It's going to get hot.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:90%
Hot, hot, hot.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason why,
for example, I think up

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:84%
in the northern
states it's going

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:84%
to be much better
than it is going to be

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:90%
down along the southern border.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean by event 11,

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.776 align:middle line:90%
"Transiting the Tail?"

00:21:44.776 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: You know,
this is one that's

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
so sad because the
Planet X system will now

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:84%
be in the southern skies
going away from us.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
This is the last insult.
This is the last slap.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The last slap.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: And you know,
this is a brown dwarf.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's just dirty.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just got all this
iron oxide dust around it.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
fly through that.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
have meteor showers.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling
you, when you look

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:84%
at the Ten Plagues
of Exodus, reorder it

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
in scientific order around a
flyby of a brown dwarf coming

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.427 align:middle line:90%
through your system--

00:22:20.427 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bang.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.074 align:middle line:90%
Bang.

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Like LEGOs.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:90%
Like LEGOs.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "The Backside."

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: The
backside is-- we'll

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:90%
see blue skies once again.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
I always want

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.740 align:middle line:90%
people to have hope for that.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say,
you're giving us

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.040 align:middle line:90%
a little glimpse of hope here.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd like to talk
about-- yes it's a dark cloud,

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:90%
but there's a silver lining.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.480 align:middle line:90%
And I want people to have hope.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I want them to hope
for the future.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.010 align:middle line:90%
It's worth living to see.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
something where humanity

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:90%
is going to be unshackled.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.430 align:middle line:90%
We are going to see creativity.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:90%
The Earth will cleanse itself.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:00.660 align:middle line:90%
We get a cold.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:90%
We get a flu.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.480 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:90%
We hydrate.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:03.980 align:middle line:90%
We rest.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:04.994 align:middle line:90%
We get over it.

00:23:04.994 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're saying
we do the same thing here?

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's right.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is going
to cleanse itself.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:84%
We will have the storm
clouds will come in.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
new lands rising up.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.610 align:middle line:84%
The rains are going to wash
the salts away and leave

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.460 align:middle line:90%
incredibly fertile soils.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.750 align:middle line:84%
You look at the Central
Valley in California,

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:90%
that was an inland sea.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And we rebuild.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.420 align:middle line:90%
We will rebuild.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.865 align:middle line:84%
And so the point is,
how do we rebuild?

00:23:31.865 --> 00:23:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.365 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: All right.

00:23:33.365 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:84%
The elites are going
to have their bunkers

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.261 align:middle line:84%
with food, medicine,
construction materials, and all

00:23:38.261 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think that's
what they're doing now?

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.310 align:middle line:90%
They're stockpiling, because--

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We hear
reports of that.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:42.865 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yes.

00:23:42.865 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to come up when

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:90%
things are starting to settle.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to say,
sign on the dotted line,

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.410 align:middle line:84%
accept slavery, and we'll
give this stuff to you.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look at for example
the Svalbard Seed Vault,

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the doomsday seed vault
that's up in Svalbard--

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.062 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which was smart.

00:23:59.062 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah, it's smart.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You need to do that.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:90%
But look at the website.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.880 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Bill Gates', most
famous monopolist,

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:84%
is the poster child, and
Monsanto's funneling the money

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:09.745 align:middle line:90%
Do you think they've got--

00:24:09.745 --> 00:24:11.807 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they're
GMO seeds too, right?

00:24:11.807 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: No.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
They're not putting
GMO seeds in there.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not?

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: They don't
want that garbage.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.020 align:middle line:90%
That garbage is for us.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.160 align:middle line:90%
That's to kill us.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's our stuff.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.406 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: They want
the heritage stuff.

00:24:20.406 --> 00:24:22.130 align:middle line:84%
They want the good
stuff, all right?

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:90%
So you look at--

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's left of it.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Yeah.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.570 align:middle line:90%
What's left of it.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.320 align:middle line:84%
You look at their
website, they don't say,

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do this
for the love of humanity.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big do you
think the seed vault is?

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: It's immense.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that there's
several more of them.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bigger
than this studio?

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Oh, many times.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Many times.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.164 align:middle line:90%
All full of sacks of seeds.

00:24:40.164 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Absolutely.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:84%
They have been collecting
best-of-class heritage variety

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:90%
seeds--

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tomatoes.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: --from all over.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Peppers.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Anything imaginable.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cherry trees.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.493 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: From all
of the continents,

00:24:49.493 --> 00:24:51.395 align:middle line:84%
from all four
corners of the earth.

00:24:51.395 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Peach trees.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Peach trees, yes.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Everything you could imagine.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:90%
And so they've got those plans.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, if people can
survive and get through this

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.440 align:middle line:84%
in communities and just
say no, because they're

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:90%
self-sufficient--

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will life continue
while this is going on?

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Will banks be open,
food stores are open,

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:90%
water systems are working?

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Or are we talking about a
calamity beyond anything

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.185 align:middle line:90%
we can even wonder?

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: It's a calamity.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Things are going to go.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And right now, amongst
a lot of the researchers

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I talk with, what we're worried
about is having 140 Fukushimas.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we're talking
about economic collapse.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: Economic collapse.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about-- I'm looking

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.980 align:middle line:84%
at industrial accidents are
going to be-- going to be

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:90%
a horrific cause of death.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.527 align:middle line:84%
I do what's called survival
relocation analysis for folks.

00:25:46.527 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:90%
And there's places--

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.857 align:middle line:90%
That's your other hat, I guess.

00:25:49.857 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: That's one of my
other hats, yes, another one

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:90%
on the rack.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when
I first started

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:84%
doing these many years ago,
central Pennsylvania to me

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.460 align:middle line:90%
was a wonderful place.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, now it's got fracking,
nuclear on one side,

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.040 align:middle line:90%
nuclear on the other.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we have
entire areas which

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:15.390 align:middle line:84%
would be optimal prime survival
land that these fracking wells,

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
these casings are designed
for a 30-year lifespan.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
About 5% fail when
they're made, OK?

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: You throw--
imagine what happens

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:90%
when the New Madrid goes off?

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those
fracking wells, the casings

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.094 align:middle line:90%
are going to rupture.

00:26:30.094 --> 00:26:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Goodbye, St. Louis.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: That's it.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have
all of this toxic witch's

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.460 align:middle line:90%
brew of chemicals.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.649 align:middle line:90%
It's browned earth, bad water.

00:26:40.649 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you tell an 18-year-old

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:84%
who's concerned about his
future knowing what you know?

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell him today?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MASTERS: What I would say
is the most important thing

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.950 align:middle line:84%
with planning and preparation
is that you're proactive.

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:84%
You are doing
something constructive,

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.390 align:middle line:90%
just not studying the problem.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.684 align:middle line:84%
And I see that
that's a real problem

00:27:02.684 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:90%
I see with people out there.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:90%
I call it death by denial.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you're doing something
you-- yes, stockpiling,

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you know, the beans,
bullets, and bunkers thing.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:10%
But more importantly,
this is not

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:10%
going to be just this
little short two or three

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:10%
months thing.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:10%
This is going to be 7
to 10 years, George.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:10%
And so to get through
something like

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:10%
that you need to have emotional,
spiritual, intellectual

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.030 align:middle line:10%
balance.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:10%
You need to be walking
humbly with your God.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And so if there's
anything you do

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:41.350 align:middle line:84%
it's that you find a path of
love with like-minded others.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's going
to pull us through.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
it's going to come to.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.192 align:middle line:84%
Marshall, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:27:46.192 --> 00:27:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MASTERS: My pleasure.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you thought
part one was scary, well,

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:90%
you just heard part two.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:10%
Something is happening
in our solar system.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:10%
And it's happening right now.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and this is
"Beyond Belief." [THEME MUSIC]
