>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief"

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.550 align:middle line:10%
with our very special guest,
Billy Carson, a researcher,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.930 align:middle line:10%
a blogger, social
media manager--

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:10%
and one of the best, and
also founder of the 4--

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:10%
that's with this--

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.832 align:middle line:10%
4biddenknowledge.com Billy,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BILLY CARSON: Hey,
I'm glad to be back.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's new with you?

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, a lot
of exciting things.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.342 align:middle line:10%
The book that I wrote,
"Compendium of the Emerald

00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:47.183 align:middle line:10%
Tablets," became a
bestseller on Amazon.

00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.480 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:10%
It's a really a
great accomplishment.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:10%
That is exciting.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:10%
Very excited about that.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.328 align:middle line:10%
Working on a movie right
now called "Chronicles

00:00:54.328 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:10%
of the Anunnaki," which is
going to be a box office level

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.068 align:middle line:10%
movie produced by Damon
Dash at Dame Dash Studios.

00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because
the subject matter

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:84%
that you handle isn't something
that the everyday person wakes

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
up and goes, hey, I
want to go study that.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.128 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You know, it really
started back from 1977.

00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:84%
We lived next to an
airport in Miami,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Florida called the Opa
Locka Airport, very small

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:90%
private airport.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.413 align:middle line:84%
And I saw planes going over
my backyard all the time.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:20.830 align:middle line:84%
But this one
particular time I saw

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
an object that went over that
didn't look like an airplane.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Even as a kid, I didn't know
what a UFO or flying saucer

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.162 align:middle line:84%
was, but I knew what a
fuselage and wings look like.

00:01:29.162 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that you knew.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:90%
That I knew.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see
that on this object.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.673 align:middle line:84%
So I went to Rainbow Park
Elementary the next day,

00:01:36.673 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
went to the library,
because this is the '70s.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So I had to get the
old encyclopedia.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.065 align:middle line:84%
So I got all the Encyclopedia
Britannicas on aerospace.

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And I literally started
researching aerospace

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:90%
and technology from back then.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Much later, what
happened was, I started

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:84%
saying OK, I've been
researching all this technology.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:84%
It's got to maybe link to
something from a long time ago.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So I started
digging into the ancient past

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that they were
talking about technology

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
in ancient texts and started
putting two and two together

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.397 align:middle line:90%
and saying, wow.

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
There could be evidence of a
very highly technologically

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.340 align:middle line:84%
advanced ancient
civilization on this planet.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And digging into
the ancient past you did.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
Thoth and the emerald tablets.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.538 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Thoth is an ancient
Atlantian priest King.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
This is what he was
called back then.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
He was also the son of
Enki, which was an Anunnaki.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So the Anunnaki and Atlantians
are really one and the same,

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:90%
I should say.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Anunnaki came from
another planet called Nibiru.

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:31.703 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Right, from another
planet named Nibiru, and also

00:02:31.703 --> 00:02:33.617 align:middle line:84%
other star systems as
well, not just Nibiru.

00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
They came from
multiple star systems--

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: --which
is one of the things

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:90%
that I talk about in the book.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
But Thoth himself was basically
the bringer of knowledge

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.910 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom to mankind.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.917 align:middle line:84%
And he was ordered
by his dad to go

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
around the planet and
kickstart civilization

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And after the
Great Flood, he was

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:84%
told to bring back
civilization to a higher level.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And he was then told to
take his crew with him

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and go out and start off
in the land of Kim, which

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
is ancient Egypt before
it was called Egypt.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't Thoth have
that bird-like look to him?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.680 align:middle line:84%
He looks like a bird, like
he's got that bird beak.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:90%
But he's really not a bird man.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:84%
That bird is the symbol
of the Ibis beak.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they chose
that symbolization for Thoth

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:84%
is because an ibis bird has to
dig its beak deep into the mud

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:90%
to bring up sustenance.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So this symbology
is basically saying,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
he's going into darkness
to bring darkness to light.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.512 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
take a look at Thoth.

00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: The
trail of the occult

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:10%
begins in Egypt
5,000 years ago, just

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.930 align:middle line:10%
before the rise of Egypt's
great pharaohs, hieroglyphics

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.250 align:middle line:10%
or pictographs were invented.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:10%
Egyptians used them to document
their history and religion

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:10%
and to practice complex systems
of astronomy, astrology,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:10%
and geometry.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:10%
They believed their
powerful knowledge

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:10%
came from the god Thoth.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Thoth, or Tehuti, was
the Egyptian god of magic.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:10%
And more than just
the god of magic,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle line:10%
he was the god of
writing, of astronomy,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:10%
of mathematics, and science.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.863 align:middle line:10%
He invented language,
he invented writing.

00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Only priests
with special training

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:10%
were allowed access to
Thoth's sacred knowledge.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.503 align:middle line:10%
Amenhotep, builder of the first
pyramid, was one of the chosen.

00:04:11.503 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:10%
>>CHRISTINE PAYNE-TOWLER:
Thoth was considered

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:10%
to be the one who
gave us writing

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:10%
and numbers and the
arts of self-cultivation

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:10%
through works of consciousness.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:10%
Some people thought he was a
person who was then deified

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:10%
through his accomplishments.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:10%
Other people feel this
has been a mythical entity

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.390 align:middle line:10%
from the beginning.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Legends held that a
book of magic written by Thoth

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.752 align:middle line:10%
contained the
secrets of the gods.

00:04:35.752 --> 00:04:37.210 align:middle line:10%
>>PAYNE-TOWLER:
"The Book of Thoth"

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:10%
was actually considered to
be in the astral plane, not

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:10%
a physical thing, but something
that you had to actually travel

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:10%
in consciousness to arrive at.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:10%
And so this is probably one
of those very old incidences

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.890 align:middle line:10%
of channeling,
where an individual

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:10%
would get into a
special state of mind,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:10%
contact the Thoth energy,
wherever it was to be found,

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:10%
and then be tutored by this
multilingual multi-code kind

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.680 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of
a creature was this?

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, he was
really a very special being.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.632 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't a Homo
sapiens sapiens like us,

00:05:17.632 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
because according to
the ancient tablets,

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:84%
we came along
much, much later on

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.730 align:middle line:90%
in the geological time scale.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we may have
been seeded by them, right?

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, I really think that
they are like our cousins,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.018 align:middle line:90%
and we look like them.

00:05:29.018 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I think that Homo
sapiens sapiens are

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
the new kids on the block and
that these ancient beings,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:84%
these beings of old, were here
many, many millions of years

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:84%
ago and had developed
technologies

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
to extend their lifespans
for many tens of thousands

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was Thoth's role?

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.248 align:middle line:90%
What was its purpose?

00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, this is where
we get the word "thought" from.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So he was the bringer
of knowledge and wisdom

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:90%
to mankind.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:84%
All the different
languages on the planet,

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
he was ordered to teach all
the different languages,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.420 align:middle line:84%
to teach the civilizations
how to develop

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:90%
different levels of technology.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And also he was the
master architect

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid structures
all over this entire planet.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:90%
That was one of the key roles.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.543 align:middle line:84%
And matter of fact, in
the "Emerald Tablets"

00:06:08.543 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:84%
he says himself, he built
the great [INAUDIBLE],,

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:90%
I built the Great Pyramid.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So he developed the Great
Pyramid and that technology.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And then after they rose the
land of Khem back to a higher

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:84%
level of civilization, he told
the people that came along with

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.515 align:middle line:90%
him-- his crew members--

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:84%
to spread out all
over the planet

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and duplicate exactly
what they did there.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, did
he have a lifespan?

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.297 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how long did he live?

00:06:29.297 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: These beings
are capable of living

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:90%
for tens of thousands of years.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
He talks about going
into this place called

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.940 align:middle line:84%
the Halls of Amenti, which is
underneath the Great Pyramid,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:90%
that's where he put it.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And recently those rooms have
been discovered down there,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, he goes into
these regeneration chambers

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.100 align:middle line:84%
where he takes an
avatar body that he

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:84%
puts into a regeneration
chamber and leaves it

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
in there for 100 years
while he walks amongst men

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:90%
in another avatar body.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.890 align:middle line:84%
This is why he had so many
different names and so many

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
different looks over
many eons, because he was

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.518 align:middle line:90%
utilizing these avatar bodies.

00:07:01.518 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's the same him.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:03.977 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's the same him.

00:07:03.977 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:84%
He transfers his consciousness
from his avatar body

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.290 align:middle line:84%
to the next one
that's regenerated.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And he puts the depleted avatar
body-- either he gets rid of it

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
or puts it back into
a rejuvenation chamber

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:90%
and regenerates that one again.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.558 align:middle line:84%
So they have done this for
tens of thousands of years.

00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't that
what we're trying

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.060 align:middle line:84%
to do now with cryogenics
and by downloading memory

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
so you can put it
into a different body,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.877 align:middle line:90%
and you live forever?

00:07:28.877 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, we've gone even
a step further than cryogenics

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.830 align:middle line:84%
They've just developed
the first DNA hard drive--

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Microsoft has.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:90%
So you can take--

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.218 align:middle line:84%
one gram of DNA can store
433 petabytes of data.

00:07:40.218 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So they discovered that
it can store digital bits

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:90%
of 0's and 1's in information.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So they've created a
digital DNA hard drive,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.222 align:middle line:84%
which was the biggest limitation
on transferring consciousness.

00:07:49.222 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the capability
of transferring consciousness

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
into a storage
capacity, and then

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
with now the creation of
the ability to create--

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
to create avatars
from stem cells,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:84%
we can literally take a
skin cell from your body,

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:84%
put it under the right chemical
conditions in a laboratory,

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
create a clone of you up
to whatever age specified,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and then transfer
your consciousness

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
from your body, your mind,
into that new avatar.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, the emerald tablets.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.452 align:middle line:84%
Tell me the emerald tablets'
role and what they are.

00:08:18.452 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
the emerald tablets

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
were a writing that were
authored directly by Thoth

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Other words, he
didn't have a scribe

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:84%
write these, he
wrote them himself,

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.630 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of unique
for us back in those times.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.267 align:middle line:84%
They would usually
a god or a king,

00:08:31.267 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
they would have a scribe
do all the writing.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:90%
These he authored.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:84%
He said that he was
leaving these behind

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.558 align:middle line:84%
to guide mankind back
into the golden age,

00:08:39.558 --> 00:08:40.850 align:middle line:90%
basically, back into the light.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like
the 10 commandments?

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Well, yeah.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you look
at the emerald tablets,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.825 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize
you're reading something

00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
that predates the biblical text
by tens of thousands of years.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.733 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible is saying
almost the exact same thing

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
when you look at some of the
wording in the New Testament.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of show side
by side that where

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:02.205 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is quoted as speaking in
the New Testament versus what

00:09:02.205 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Thoth is saying in
the emerald tablets.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:90%
And you're going, oh my god.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Which came first?

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.850 align:middle line:90%
The chicken or the egg?

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.780 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that the
words are matching up.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But when you go and
research further

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:84%
into the words of Jesus, which
is really his name is Yeshua,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
you discover something in
the Gospel of the Holy 12

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.587 align:middle line:84%
where he left and
went to Egypt to live.

00:09:19.587 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually
been to the place he

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:90%
lived in Egypt in Coptic Cairo.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And then from there
he went to Tibet

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and also to India, where you
learned mystic arts and Reiki

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:84%
healing with his hands, teaching
reincarnation the whole way

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.120 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So he was a student of
the minstry schools.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could Moses
have been given

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle line:84%
the emerald tablets as
opposed to the so-called 10

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Commandments?

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Moses
got his information

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.742 align:middle line:84%
from something called the
42 Laws of Ma'at, which

00:09:42.742 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:84%
is something that's out of the
"Egyptian Book of the Dead,"

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
or the "Book of
Going Forth by Day."

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
42 commandments out

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:84%
of which they took
10, and they made it

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:90%
into the modern day Bible.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are the
emerald tablets today, Billy?

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I really believe
that the emerald tablets,

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:84%
the original version, are
underneath the Vatican archives

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:90%
in a five-acre--

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hidden away?

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Hidden away down way
beneath that five-acre archive

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
they have, or
five-mile archive they

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:90%
have underneath the Vatican

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Who would have translated them?

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.622 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, lots of
people have translated them

00:10:09.622 --> 00:10:10.520 align:middle line:90%
over many years.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:84%
You'll have St. Thomas
Aquinas, the Queen of Sheba.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.277 align:middle line:84%
Sir Isaac Newton translated
the emerald tablet

00:10:17.277 --> 00:10:19.610 align:middle line:84%
of Hermes, which is actually
on display at the Cambridge

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Library.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You know,
many famous people--

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Michael Doreal, Roger Bacon.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So lots of very
well-known scholars

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:84%
have come in contact
with this information

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and deciphered it
over many years.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Edgar Cayce has
talked about in his day

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:90%
the Hall of Records.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said they
were located in three

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:90%
places throughout this planet.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.203 align:middle line:84%
Did Thoth have Hall
of Records, too?

00:10:43.203 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, he did.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, he claims
to have had a Hall of Records

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
that were hidden one
underneath the Great Sphinx

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and one inside of the
Great Pyramid itself.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.948 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
they've found both.

00:10:53.948 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
In my personal
opinion, when you look

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:84%
at a lot of the research
that have come out

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
over the last few years,
they found this chamber.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
They were doing a cosmic
scan of the Great Pyramid,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.255 align:middle line:90%
something called a muon scan.

00:11:03.255 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A muon scan?

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:90%
Muon.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And during this muon
scan, using cosmic rays,

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:84%
they found this hidden chamber
above the Grand Gallery

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Pyramid,
this massive open area,

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:84%
which might be one of
the locations of one

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:90%
of these Hall of Records.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What could be in there?

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, wow.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of secretive texts
from the ancient mystery

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
schools, the true
knowledge and wisdom

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
that was meant to be passed on
to mankind in our current era,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
which unfortunately, a lot of
the stuff that has been found,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.148 align:middle line:84%
I think, has been swept away and
hidden by some of the elites.

00:11:34.148 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:84%
But I really do believe that
there could be information

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:84%
of high advanced technology,
zero-point energy devices,

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:90%
esoteric wisdom and knowledge.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:43.835 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Flying machines?

00:11:43.835 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Everything?

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.205 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, he
talks about the fact

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that he has a flying machine
or a spaceship hidden

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:84%
underneath the
paw of the Sphinx.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.375 align:middle line:84%
And recent scans discovered
that there's a huge--

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There is a chamber.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: --massive
object there.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something down there.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.955 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, there's
something down there.

00:11:57.955 --> 00:12:00.747 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, there's also
massive tunnels down there too.

00:12:00.747 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So we would never know if
they used one of those tunnels

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.553 align:middle line:84%
to get access to this
thing and move it away.

00:12:05.553 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I know there was a
very big special that

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:84%
was going to air live about five
years ago on one of the science

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.650 align:middle line:90%
channels.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the night that
it was supposed to air,

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:90%
it got canceled.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I just think that
somebody at a higher level

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:90%
said, you know what?

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pull this,
we're going to go down there

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and see what it is
ourselves, and maybe get it.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.335 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
release the scanned images

00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle line:90%
and everything live on TV.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.695 align:middle line:90%
And then it got cut.

00:12:28.695 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, what
does this tell you

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
about our ancients
and our ancient past?

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, it tells us
that they were very highly

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:90%
advanced, very sophisticated.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.588 align:middle line:90%
The evidence is all around us.

00:12:38.588 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:84%
We can't duplicate
some of the things

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
that they've done just
with architecture.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Can't imagine what they've
been able to do technologically

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:90%
to be able to even--

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.082 align:middle line:84%
to be able to even
build that architecture.

00:12:48.082 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there's
a lot of evidence

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
around, including in
these ancient texts that

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
talk about flying machines,
talk about different types

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.170 align:middle line:84%
of engines, talk about
different types of tools

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.605 align:middle line:84%
and technologies, even
in the Book of Enoch

00:12:59.605 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:84%
it talks about the fact
that these beings came down

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
from the sky and taught
humans how to build weapons

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:90%
of war and everything else.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So it tells us that these
people that came here--

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:90%
some were good, some were bad.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But overall they were highly
technologically advanced.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And they had
extensive lifespans,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.623 align:middle line:84%
which gave us the illusion
that they were immortal.

00:13:16.623 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now back to
Thoth for a second.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Why did he have this reptilian
bird-like look to him?

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.627 align:middle line:84%
Or was that just a
headpiece costume?

00:13:23.627 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, it was
just a representation

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:90%
of the ibis bird.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at an
ibis bird, an ibis bird

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
has to dig its beak deep
into the mud to bring up

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:90%
its sustenance and its food.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So what the representation
here, or the symbology there

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
with Thoth, is that he's going
into darkness to bring darkness

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:90%
back to light.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So he goes into
areas where he always

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.500 align:middle line:84%
talks about in the emerald
tablets where mankind

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:84%
has fallen into a low
level of consciousness

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
or fallen to a low
level of civilization.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And he's got to go down there
now and bring them back up.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning of
the emerald tablets what

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
happens is the Great Flood
waters are starting to subside.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And the people are coming out
of the caves several generations

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying that they
have fallen to a low level.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And his dad says, you need to go
down there and bring them back,

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:90%
restart civilization there.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the symbology
of him going to darkness

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and bringing darkness
back to light.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he an alien?

00:14:14.475 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think
that he was an alien.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.478 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that they were
from this planet at all.

00:14:18.478 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:84%
When you look into a lot of
these ancient tablets now--

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.198 align:middle line:84%
I've researched and read now
over 1,000 tablet scriptures

00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and texts and bake stones
and everything else, cylinder

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.852 align:middle line:90%
scrolls, over the last 20 years.

00:14:27.852 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:90%
And you starting to realize--

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to realize--
that there was an ancient war

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:84%
possibly in the Pleiadian star
cluster, which is mentioned

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
in Homer's "Iliad" and the
Bible and everything else,

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.228 align:middle line:84%
these Pleiadian star
of the Seven Sisters

00:14:39.228 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:90%
where there was an ancient war.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And I really do believe that
refugees fled that region.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Some ended up in the Orion,
some end up in the Sirius star

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.492 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Star system.

00:14:47.492 --> 00:14:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And also
some I believe ended up

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
on this Nibiru planet, which
was orbiting a brown dwarf star.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that the original
refugees that crash

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.583 align:middle line:90%
landed there is what I think.

00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And that brown
dwarf star ended up

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:84%
getting captured by
our solar system.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And now modern day
astronomers are

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:84%
saying that there is
another solar system

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:90%
within our own solar system.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:90%
There's two suns there.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:84%
One's a brown dwarf, and
one's our yellow sun.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.765 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Zecharia
Sitchin, God rest his soul,

00:15:12.765 --> 00:15:15.560 align:middle line:84%
would be vindicated because he
talked about this in his books

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.493 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:15:16.493 --> 00:15:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: He sure did.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:10%
You know, Zecharia
Sitchin system

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:10%
was one of the
greatest researchers.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:10%
I'd never stop saying that.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.147 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people were
making up stuff about him

00:15:23.147 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:10%
at the end of his
life, unfortunately.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:10%
But the truth is, when you
read his prefaces of his books,

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.790 align:middle line:10%
he tells you where he
got his information.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that he
deciphered these tablets.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.765 align:middle line:84%
He was going off of deciphered
information already.

00:15:33.765 --> 00:15:34.565 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:15:34.565 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:90%
He was just interpreting them.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.287 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's
all he was doing.

00:15:37.287 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And his story was
pretty much dead on.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Now that dozens of
other researchers

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
have gone and done their
own work, like myself,

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.745 align:middle line:84%
and we're coming up
with the same story.

00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, so it's
really amazing.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.828 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, let's
talk about Atlantis

00:15:48.828 --> 00:15:50.260 align:middle line:90%
for a moment and the Atlantians.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:84%
What is their connection to,
like, the emerald tablets?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, the
Atlantian civilization

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is part of this Anunnaki
race that came here.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.150 align:middle line:84%
See, the inner Anunnaki name
is a generalization term

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:84%
for people coming from other
planets and star systems

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:90%
to Earth.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not just one
specific race of people.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.282 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And so these
Atlantians, they came here

00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:11.900 align:middle line:90%
in deep antiquity.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And they literally began to
develop their own civilization

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, a high
level of civilization.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:84%
They came here to mine
this planet for resources--

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:84%
not just for gold, but
for many other resources.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.258 align:middle line:84%
And they also saw it as
kind of a fresh start,

00:16:23.258 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a breakaway
civilization is what it really

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:26.532 align:middle line:90%
became for them.

00:16:26.532 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And they developed a high
level of civilization

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.910 align:middle line:84%
here without Homo sapiens
sapiens just on their own.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
At some point they began to
go to war against each other.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is even talked about
in the book of Deuteronomy.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:84%
This is talked about in
many other ancient texts

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.962 align:middle line:84%
where these gods started
going against each other

00:16:41.962 --> 00:16:42.762 align:middle line:90%
and fighting.

00:16:42.762 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
There were some living on Mars
called the Igigi, which were

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:90%
the working class Anunnaki.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.590 align:middle line:84%
They came down,
these were the gods

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.785 align:middle line:84%
that-- you know, the angels
that fell from heaven.

00:16:50.785 --> 00:16:52.160 align:middle line:84%
They came down
from Mars to Earth

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:84%
to go to battle
against Enlil and Enki.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And there was a big war
that was about to start.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they decided
to make the Homo sapiens.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But where we lost Atlantis
was during this global flood

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:90%
that came.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it
washed Atlantis away.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:84%
But then after that,
there was another war.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.330 align:middle line:90%
So these are a warring race.

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These emerald tablets
talk about the Great Flood,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
which leads me to
believe they came--

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.720 align:middle line:84%
the tablets-- after
the flood, obviously.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.395 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Well, yeah.

00:17:20.395 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
The tablets were
written after the flood.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Now there was-- because
the tablets were written

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.339 align:middle line:84%
after the Flood, but the tablets
mention life before the Flood.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.130 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at the
Sumerian Kings list, which

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:10%
is located in the Ashmolean
Museum in Oxford, England,

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:10%
the Kings list of
antediluvial kings

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:10%
that ruled over Earth
for over 200,000 years.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:10%
Just a handful of rings
ruling for many-- some ruling

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.890 align:middle line:10%
for 14,000 years, some
ruling for 28,000 years.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:10%
These people had
extensive lifespans.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the main
displays at the Ashmolean

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Museum.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So pre-flood, there
were people here

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that were not human
beings that were

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:84%
ruling over this planet in
different cities on this earth.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's well documented
and baked into clay.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.092 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And hence the
flood to get rid of them?

00:18:04.092 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
it's a combination.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.215 align:middle line:84%
It could have been from
Enlil point of view

00:18:08.215 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of them, or that
they knew it was coming

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't want to stop it.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.153 align:middle line:84%
They could have stopped
it, but they didn't.

00:18:13.153 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Or some of the
interpretations state

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that they caused
the flood on purpose

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
to get a fresh
start on this planet

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.347 align:middle line:84%
and wipe away the people
and everything else and all

00:18:22.347 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
the technology and
start all over again.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So that interpretation
is kind of up in the air,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
whether it was something that
was geological that could have

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.888 align:middle line:84%
been prevented, but
wasn't, or whether it

00:18:30.888 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:84%
was done by an
act that was like,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.930 align:middle line:84%
we want to make this
happen right now.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:36.680 align:middle line:90%
And it was done.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
caused the flood, Billy?

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I really think that
the flood was probably caused

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:90%
by a comet that was coming by.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought they saw an
opportunity to take this comet

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:90%
and crash it into the planet.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it did hit?

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think happened.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:90%
I think that they used it.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hit the ocean and--

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Hit the ocean.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --water for
40 days and 40 nights.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.655 align:middle line:84%
A lot of turmoil and everything
else on the entire planet.

00:19:00.655 --> 00:19:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
was probably one

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:84%
of maybe several great floods
I think there were probably

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:84%
two more other floods,
but not ones that

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:11.000 align:middle line:84%
covered the entire planet, just
big regions of different areas.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.183 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did that flood destroy
the Atlantic civilization?

00:19:15.183 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, it did.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.427 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, it destroyed
the Atlantian civilization.

00:19:19.427 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it was directly
in the middle of the Atlantic

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.625 align:middle line:84%
Ocean is where it originally
was, in my personal opinion

00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:84%
now from doing a
lot of research.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I think that one
of the main reasons why I think

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.610 align:middle line:84%
it was a directed meteor
strike was because there

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.700 align:middle line:84%
was a little bit of anxiety
and anger back and forth

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.940 align:middle line:84%
between these Atlantian
people about the fact

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.950 align:middle line:84%
that some of them had now
taken these humanoid clone men

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.077 align:middle line:84%
and women and started
mating with them

00:19:48.077 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:90%
outside of their own race.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Creating the Nephilim?

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:90%
And so it was like, OK.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:90%
This is enough.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And then it became
a jealousy thing,

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:90%
and then it became a war.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And eventually
when there were so

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.860 align:middle line:84%
many people on this planet
they decided, you know what?

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just
wipe everything clean

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.907 align:middle line:90%
and start fresh again.

00:20:03.907 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did some of
them from Atlantis flee

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:84%
to places like Egypt and then
contribute to the building

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.855 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramids?

00:20:10.855 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:12.855 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what happened.

00:20:12.855 --> 00:20:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Thoth was one of the
original Atlantians.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:90%
He's the son of Anki.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.007 align:middle line:90%
And after they fled--

00:20:19.007 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
after the Great Flood they
fled to a safe location

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:90%
not on this planet.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Because he talks about in the
emerald tablets in the opening

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.103 align:middle line:84%
verses that his dad tells
him to get in this great ship

00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and take the crew with you
and go back to the Earth.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.272 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And get out.

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So they
actually take off

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
into the sky until they see
this sort of planet disappear.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:84%
When they got to Earth
they then started

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
descending where they saw one
of the ancient great temples

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:84%
with the flood waters
residing down beneath it.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's when they
decided to land.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
they're from Earth.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.187 align:middle line:84%
They went away and
they came back.

00:20:48.187 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're always going
and coming all the time.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.987 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: But these are
some really advanced people.

00:20:52.987 --> 00:20:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And when they open
the doors to the ship,

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.070 align:middle line:84%
the people at that time
now were like barbaric,

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:90%
and they wanted to attack them.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:90%
And Thoth raises his staff.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And he says he sent out a ray of
vibrations stopping them still

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.182 align:middle line:90%
as stone in the mountain.

00:21:05.182 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So he had some kind
of advanced weaponry

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that froze these people
but didn't kill them.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.308 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of compare that
in the book to something

00:21:12.308 --> 00:21:14.600 align:middle line:84%
we have called the active
denial system in the military

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
now where they have the
same beam weapon that

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.730 align:middle line:84%
could stop a crowd
from attacking

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:90%
without injuring anybody.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And it renders them down to
their knees, practically.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So I make the
comparisons there so you

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:84%
can see we're talking advanced
technology in ancient times.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could the craft
that you're talking about--

00:21:28.627 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:84%
the ships that you're
talking about--

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
have been basically the story
of Noah's Ark in the fact

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that maybe they went up in
a spaceship, not a boat?

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I really do believe that
Noah's Ark was a DNA bank.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at the
Epic of Gilgamesh, which

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:84%
is one of the Sumerian
tablets, which

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:84%
is like the full
story of Noah's Ark,

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:84%
he was given a design to
build an actual submersible.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't square
or rectangular,

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.330 align:middle line:90%
it was actually round.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:01.130 align:middle line:90%
The actual--

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a craft.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Like a craft.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And some of his local animals,
just his local farm animals

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:90%
were put on there.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:84%
But overall it was
really the collection

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:84%
of DNA from all around
the planet of animals

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
that they would have needed
to re-kickstart civilization.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think I went
to a DNA bank.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.633 align:middle line:90%
And then they were--

00:22:17.633 --> 00:22:20.083 align:middle line:84%
because Thoth and Anki
were massive geneticists.

00:22:20.083 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it was
very easy for them

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.982 align:middle line:90%
to bring back these animals.

00:22:23.982 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:84%
In one part of the
Sumerian tablets

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
they talk about fashioning
a lamb because lambs

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.073 align:middle line:90%
hadn't been here yet.

00:22:29.073 --> 00:22:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So these people were
very advanced genetically

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.143 align:middle line:84%
and were able to make
all these animals.

00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
a point where I

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:84%
would say we've lost all
this past information.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But researchers like you
have obviously found it.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's here.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:84%
You just have to read so many
different things and research

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.208 align:middle line:84%
so much information to
paint the big picture.

00:22:47.208 --> 00:22:49.500 align:middle line:84%
You can't just like go, I'm
going to read this one book

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and I'll learn about
the ancient past.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not going
to happen that way.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: No.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go
through thousands

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.720 align:middle line:84%
of text and scriptures and books
and writings and perspectives

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:90%
and information.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And you have to research
modern technology

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
envision what they're

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:84%
trying to say if you don't
compare it to something

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:90%
in the modern times.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of
modern technology right now

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:84%
that will really give you an
idea of what they were talking

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.633 align:middle line:90%
about in the ancient past.

00:23:12.633 --> 00:23:14.825 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
still here, Billy?

00:23:14.825 --> 00:23:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I really
do believe they are.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.720 align:middle line:84%
In the emerald tablets,
Thoth talks about the fact

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
that they walk amongst
men, but unlike men.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.708 align:middle line:84%
So they use these avatar bodies
that they clone and create.

00:23:26.708 --> 00:23:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And they put their
consciousness into them.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.235 align:middle line:84%
They call it transfer my ego
into this sleeve, basically.

00:23:32.235 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
know what they are?

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: They
know what they are.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Mm-hmm.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.950 align:middle line:84%
I think they've long shed
their original avatar

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:84%
bodies that they were
probably born with.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And they've now just been
jumping from body to body.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
they jump from bodies

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:90%
that are not theirs.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:84%
It appears that they
have the capability

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
of making their own
sleeves, and they

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.223 align:middle line:90%
transfer into those bodies.

00:23:52.223 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since
this has been going

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.220 align:middle line:84%
on since the beginning
of time, I would think,

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
are they doing this
on other planets, too?

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.663 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, I
really do believe so.

00:24:01.663 --> 00:24:03.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest things
that I've researched

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:90%
are space anomalies.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And I've made the news
on that many times,

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.680 align:middle line:84%
researching information from
the NASA and the European Space

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Agency, the Russian Space
Agency, the Indian Space

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.853 align:middle line:84%
agency, and looking into
all of their space data

00:24:15.853 --> 00:24:17.520 align:middle line:84%
from the probes that
have been sent out,

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.270 align:middle line:84%
all the rovers that
have been sent out.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And we've now-- the United
Family of Anomaly Hunters--

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
we've cataloged
thousands and thousands

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
of images, over 58,000 anomalies
in our solar system alone.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of these things look
like things just on Earth.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:84%
On Venus I discovered
through the USGS.gov radar

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:90%
image of a city there.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And this city actually looks
like it's got a temple on it

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:40.990 align:middle line:90%
with a cross.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So I think that
they've duplicated this thing

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.990 align:middle line:84%
over and over again,
masquerading as gods as they

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
go, and utilizing
people as cattle to do

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the work for them.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I got a call a couple
weeks ago from a former NASA

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
employee who is well
known, but I'm not

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.610 align:middle line:90%
going to mention his name yet.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And he's in bad health,
very bad health.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, wow.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
said, George, I want

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
to put together a bunch of
documents and send them to you.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Give me your address.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's
in these documents?

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you got
to see them first.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But they're coming
from within NASA.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to
get these things.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Oh, yeah.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who knows
what they are?

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.733 align:middle line:84%
It's probably going to
be a lot of anomalies

00:25:24.733 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:90%
that weren't obfuscated.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of stuff
that's popping up

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:90%
that's coming out now.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And the government's
kind of really giving us

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:84%
a drop by drop disclosure
and letting people kind of

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:90%
get the information.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:41.302 align:middle line:84%
They're not really denying
aliens and UFOs anymore.

00:25:41.302 --> 00:25:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So they're kind of just
letting us be the researchers

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and look it up and bring it
to the general population as

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.595 align:middle line:84%
like, we're a form of
the disclosure as well.

00:25:47.595 --> 00:25:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Our Gaia series,
called "Ancient Civilizations,"

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:84%
explores the mysteries of
the Great Pyramids as well.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.750 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDREW COLLINS: There
is an ancient code

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:10%
to be found within
the Great Pyramid.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.930 align:middle line:10%
It's within the geometry, not
just of the pyramid itself,

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:10%
but its relationship to
the other two main pyramids

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:10%
of the Giza plateau.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:10%
Having studied this
for a number of years,

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.590 align:middle line:10%
it seems to be related
very much to do

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:10%
with the idea of the
music of the spheres,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:10%
the idea that there is
some kind of connection

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:10%
between the primal tones
of the universe itself

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:35.590 align:middle line:10%
and their relationship to the
creation of form and structure

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:10%
in the physical world, and that
to somehow attune and enhance

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:45.640 align:middle line:10%
this connection, that
certain proportions have

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:10%
to be constructed into
the design of the pyramid

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:10%
and also the geometry
of the landscape itself.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.630 align:middle line:10%
And these seem to reflect
the musical intervals.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, the technology
and the architecture

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:02.240 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids are
absolutely astounding.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they do this?

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, Thoth
is the master architect

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.537 align:middle line:90%
of this whole thing.

00:27:07.537 --> 00:27:08.370 align:middle line:90%
He really laid out--

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He did everything.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: He did everything.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.353 align:middle line:90%
He laid this out.

00:27:10.353 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:84%
What he did with
the Great Pyramid

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:84%
was, he took some type of
advanced computer program

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:90%
and said, OK.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Here's all the data
that we've collected

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.180 align:middle line:84%
on the dimension of the
planet, the size of the planet,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:84%
the distance that a planet from
Earth to the moon, and so forth

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:21.993 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:27:21.993 --> 00:27:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where they built them.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:24.190 align:middle line:90%
That matters, too.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: He built
the Great Pyramid

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:84%
directly at the center
of the landmass on Earth.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Not the center of the Earth,
but the center of the landmass.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So think about
that for a minute.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.900 align:middle line:84%
In order to find out
the center of landmass

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.775 align:middle line:84%
you have to have a scan
of the entire planet.

00:27:36.775 --> 00:27:37.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:27:37.575 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And you can only
do that with technology.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And above.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: And above.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.698 align:middle line:90%
You got to be in space.

00:27:41.698 --> 00:27:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can't use a
regular satellite that

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:45.430 align:middle line:90%
just goes around the equator.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.990 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a satellite
that goes on the North Pole.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:49.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's the North Pole orbit.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very new orbit
that we ourselves just

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:84%
discovered on how to do in
the last couple of decades.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So now this type of
orbit of the planet,

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.380 align:middle line:84%
as the planet's
rotating on its axis,

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.790 align:middle line:84%
it's just going around this
way and taking an image

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:02.590 align:middle line:90%
as it rotates.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the images
are stitched together.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you get
a complete global scan.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So you can't do
it on the equator.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:09.535 align:middle line:90%
You have to do it that way.

00:28:09.535 --> 00:28:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is an amazing
piece of technology,

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.850 align:middle line:84%
or evidence of amazing
technology in the ancient past.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Then the other thing is the fact
that the location of the Grand

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Gallery are the same digits
of the speed of light

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.320 align:middle line:90%
in meters by longitude.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Now how can you get this?

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.675 align:middle line:84%
Well, you go, well, meters
were just recently discovered.

00:28:27.675 --> 00:28:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, actually not.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.790 align:middle line:84%
If you look into the
proto-Sumerian text

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and you discover
that they had meters

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:35.260 align:middle line:84%
all the way back then,
thousands of years ago.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.580 align:middle line:90%
We rediscovered meters.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Or possibly the
gentleman that discovered

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.840 align:middle line:84%
it read the ancient Sumerian
tablets, and said, ah,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I can use this for new
mathematical calculations.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:90%
So we had meters already.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is if you take
the size of the pyramid blocks

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.088 align:middle line:84%
and multiply them by 10
squared-- a lot of them--

00:28:51.088 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:84%
you start to come up with
all these weird calculations.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.288 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You can
actually discover

00:28:55.288 --> 00:28:58.140 align:middle line:84%
the distance of the Earth to the
moon, the distance of the Earth

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.220 align:middle line:90%
to the sun.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.170 align:middle line:84%
You can calculate the tropical
year, the Sidereal year.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
You can actually calculate
the speed of the sun

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.420 align:middle line:90%
around the galactic equator.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.550 align:middle line:84%
All this is built into
the Great Pyramid.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And then what's amazing if
you look at the pyramid Giza

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:84%
from above, look at all the
temples and locations of them,

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.620 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
then draw a grid map.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And that grid map will
give you the location

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.030 align:middle line:84%
of every planet in
our inner solar system

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and the astronomical unit
distance from the sun down

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.340 align:middle line:90%
to the inches.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And compared to a NASA
interplanetary map,

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.010 align:middle line:84%
it almost overlays and
almost matches perfectly.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The mathematics
must have been unbelievable.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Unbelievable
mathematics.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is all encoded into
Giza and the Great Pyramid.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is also a
1 by 432 scale of the Earth.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is all--

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.350 align:middle line:84%
you know, and it
resonates at 432 hertz.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's-- these
aren't accidents.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's all tied together.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's
all tied together.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:29:50.015 --> 00:29:52.827 align:middle line:84%
What and who are
the dark brothers?

00:29:52.827 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: The dark
brothers are talked about

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.993 align:middle line:10%
in the emerald tablets by Thoth.

00:29:55.993 --> 00:29:58.650 align:middle line:10%
And he basically says
two things about them.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:10%
One are these are civilizations
that have risen and fallen.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.810 align:middle line:84%
They're the cause of the
fall of civilizations

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.610 align:middle line:90%
all over the universe.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:07.500 align:middle line:90%
And that it's a yin and a yang.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:84%
You can't have
good without evil,

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and you can't have
evil without good.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
But no matter where he's gone
throughout the entire universe,

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.085 align:middle line:84%
he's actually gone and watched
civilizations rise and fall.

00:30:17.085 --> 00:30:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And these dark brothers
are always the reason

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.970 align:middle line:90%
for the fall of civilizations.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes this ego
that takes over mankind,

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:84%
or these different species of
man, all over the universe,

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:31.320 align:middle line:84%
apparently, hominids are pretty
standard everywhere you go.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's this evil mentality,
this egotistical mentality,

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:84%
this power control mentality,
that takes over a person

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and then starts to drive
a civilization back

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.780 align:middle line:90%
down into dark ages again.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
them understanding

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:84%
how to get to a high
level of civilization

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.680 align:middle line:84%
consciously and technologically,
but then taking it and using

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.320 align:middle line:90%
that force for dark intentions.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For good.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Or bad.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So you have the
dark, and you have the good.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.418 align:middle line:90%
So it's almost like "Star Wars."

00:30:56.418 --> 00:30:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Makes you wonder where George
Lucas got his information

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:84%
from because you
have the dark forces

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and you have the light forces.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:02.970 align:middle line:90%
And so you have the--

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:07.860 align:middle line:84%
like, the Jedi, and then you
have the Empire or whatever.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's really--

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The force.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:90%
The force, you know.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:12.718 align:middle line:84%
And they take these
dark forces, and they

00:31:12.718 --> 00:31:14.970 align:middle line:84%
use them to turn people
against each other.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like what you see right
now just going on our planet.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.720 align:middle line:84%
We've got all the
people fighting

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.940 align:middle line:84%
against each other with a
very small amount of people

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.392 align:middle line:84%
controlling everything
from behind the scenes.

00:31:23.392 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're
controlling both sides.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.510 align:middle line:90%
So they've got us like puppets.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And they've got us
fighting each other

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.267 align:middle line:84%
so we can't find out
that we're supposed

00:31:29.267 --> 00:31:30.750 align:middle line:90%
to be really fighting them.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.806 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
it's talking about.

00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these
human beings, Billy?

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Or what were they?

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.772 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: These were
beings like him.

00:31:35.772 --> 00:31:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Atlantians, or these beings
that have the capability

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:90%
of living for many eons.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And they plant themselves
in different civilizations.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And they literally thrive off
of causing turmoil, angst,

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:52.170 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, starvation, poverty,
murder, and everything else.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Why they do this?

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
specifically say.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But this is the reason
for the cycle of the Yugas

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.130 align:middle line:84%
where civilizations
rise and fall.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.505 align:middle line:84%
Like right now
we're in something

00:32:00.505 --> 00:32:03.330 align:middle line:84%
called the Tetra Yuga, which
is like the Silver Age.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're headed back
towards the golden age again.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that a
good or bad thing?

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's a great
thing, because that's

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.020 align:middle line:84%
where lifespans are
extended, that's

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.820 align:middle line:84%
where technology is
really super advanced,

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that's where we will become
an intergalactic civilization.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And these Yugas,
these Yuga cycles last

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds of
thousands of years.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:84%
The bad thing about it
is for whatever reason,

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.260 align:middle line:90%
it then goes down again.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:84%
We go back into a
like, a Bronze Age

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.760 align:middle line:84%
where these dark brothers
or these dark forces

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.860 align:middle line:84%
start to take over
mankind again.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And we start to sink and go back
consciously into a low level.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Wars start up.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Greed starts up.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.492 align:middle line:90%
Power struggle starts up again.

00:32:39.492 --> 00:32:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
we fall into a low level

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And this cycle has happened
at least four times just

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:46.030 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
four or five million years

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.405 align:middle line:90%
of rising and falling.

00:32:50.405 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And according to
the Mayans we're

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:84%
heading into the
fifth age again.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So now we're heading back
into another golden age.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
thing that I want

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:84%
to learn from these tablets, the
reason why I wrote this book,

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.150 align:middle line:84%
is because I don't
think-- there's nowhere

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:02.252 align:middle line:84%
written that says we have
to stay in the cycle.

00:33:02.252 --> 00:33:04.710 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere written that
says we have to rise and fall.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.460 align:middle line:84%
When can we break
this time loop?

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Can we break it?

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Can we finally for once
stay at a high level

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.593 align:middle line:90%
and maintain that level?

00:33:10.593 --> 00:33:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That would be nice.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That
would be fantastic.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
Ancient Smith effect?

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.817 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:33:15.817 --> 00:33:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, you know,
this is one of the things

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.702 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with
the dark brothers

00:33:18.702 --> 00:33:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and how they subconsciously
get into your psyche.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.943 align:middle line:90%
So they control the media.

00:33:22.943 --> 00:33:23.860 align:middle line:90%
They control the news.

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
They control what we eat,
what you think, what you see,

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.100 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they the deep state
that we hear so much about?

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: The deep state.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:29.648 align:middle line:90%
They're the deep state.

00:33:29.648 --> 00:33:32.190 align:middle line:84%
They're all these hidden figures
behind the scenes pulling

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:84%
all the strings that nobody ever
can really see who they are,

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.133 align:middle line:90%
but they're there.

00:33:36.133 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's 100 families
running this entire planet.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.122 align:middle line:84%
But there's still
a handful of them

00:33:40.122 --> 00:33:42.330 align:middle line:84%
there at the top of that
mini pyramid that are really

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.220 align:middle line:90%
making all the final decisions.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
what it's all about.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.552 align:middle line:84%
So the Agent Smith
effect is when like,

00:33:48.552 --> 00:33:50.760 align:middle line:84%
if you're talking to somebody
like a friend or family

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.220 align:middle line:84%
member about what you saw on
TV, and it's like a sitcom or TV

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.020 align:middle line:90%
show.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.615 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's having a great
conversation about it.

00:33:56.615 --> 00:33:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you
stop and talk about is

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.370 align:middle line:84%
9/11 a conspiracy or
you know, what they're

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:84%
putting in our food is
poison, all of a sudden

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.380 align:middle line:90%
that person will then change.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Their continence will change.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Their attitude will change.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:84%
And they'll almost become
like a prison guard

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.462 align:middle line:84%
to stop you from talking
about those topics

00:34:14.462 --> 00:34:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and try to steer
you back into what

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:84%
the more comfortable topics
were, which was gossiping

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's like this
thing jumps into them.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like this
matrix programming

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:24.980 align:middle line:90%
takes over their body.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.014 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
dark forces that happen.

00:34:27.014 --> 00:34:28.639 align:middle line:84%
And it's called the
Agent Smith effect,

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.014 align:middle line:84%
kind of after the "Matrix"
movies where Agent Smith would

00:34:31.014 --> 00:34:34.310 align:middle line:84%
pop into the bodies of other
people to fight against Neo.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got to have
a PhD in ancient technology.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:84%
My god, how do you
know all this stuff?

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You know,
I've been researching

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.659 align:middle line:84%
this for so many years
now, you know, since 1977

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:46.962 align:middle line:84%
until this current day,
researching aerospace

00:34:46.962 --> 00:34:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and technology and
combining with the knowledge

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.337 align:middle line:84%
of ancient wisdom
and ancient text

00:34:50.337 --> 00:34:51.889 align:middle line:84%
and trying to put
the two together,

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:84%
trying to look for
unified physics.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like Nassim Haramein.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I study a lot of
his work and seeing

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:00.770 align:middle line:84%
how the quantum mechanics
and quantum physics really

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
does interact with
spirituality, you can't have one

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:90%
without the other.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:84%
If you try to only
go the spiritual way

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and not incorporate
the science behind it,

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.450 align:middle line:84%
you don't really
get the big picture.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:90%
And vice versa.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So I really tried to
put pieces of the puzzle

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.520 align:middle line:84%
together and try
to paint a picture,

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.353 align:middle line:84%
not only for myself,
but for everybody else.

00:35:18.353 --> 00:35:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, what
are cymatic frequencies?

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, these are
the hidden frequencies

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.250 align:middle line:84%
behind the ether of spacetime
that literally jingle matter

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:26.570 align:middle line:90%
into existence.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I even talk
about in the book

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.750 align:middle line:84%
that Thoth is
talking about using

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:32.270 align:middle line:84%
semantics and lights--
and photonic light--

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:33.290 align:middle line:90%
to create matter.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So he would actually
literally utilize

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:40.160 align:middle line:84%
photons and cymatic
frequencies, which are strings

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.300 align:middle line:90%
in the ether of spacetime.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.960 align:middle line:90%
It's called String Theory.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But he had the ability
to access that.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And utilizing vocalizations
and cymatic frequencies,

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:51.020 align:middle line:84%
combining the two together
to create solid bricks

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.562 align:middle line:90%
and matter and everything else.

00:35:52.562 --> 00:35:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So some of these
structures weren't

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:84%
built by going and getting
quarrying bricks and blocks.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Some of these structures
were literally manifested.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And we as now people
on Earth, scientists

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.660 align:middle line:84%
just recently-- it's in my
book, a whole article on it.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Physics.org.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.960 align:middle line:84%
They discovered
how to turn light--

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.755 align:middle line:84%
photonic light--
into solid matter.

00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So we're
just now catching up

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:17.247 align:middle line:84%
to what the ancients
already knew.

00:36:17.247 --> 00:36:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the 1970s, there was
a legendary film put together

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.500 align:middle line:90%
by Hans Jenny about cymatics.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.280 align:middle line:10%
>>HANS JENNY: Everything
owes its existence

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.830 align:middle line:10%
solely and completely to sound.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:40.070 align:middle line:10%
Sound is a factor which
holds it together.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:47.770 align:middle line:10%
Sound is the basis
of form and shape.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.710 align:middle line:10%
In the beginning was the word.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.370 align:middle line:10%
And the word was God.

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:55.330 align:middle line:10%
We are told that this
is how the world began

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:58.410 align:middle line:10%
and how creation took shape.

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.940 align:middle line:10%
If we put that into
the modern idiom

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:06.650 align:middle line:10%
and say that into the great
voids of space came a sound,

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.770 align:middle line:10%
and matter took shape.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.284 align:middle line:10%
Please watch carefully.

00:37:11.284 --> 00:37:28.090 align:middle line:90%


00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: We can also
use different shapes plate.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:10%
Here we have a triangular
plate with a crystal

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:38.520 align:middle line:10%
attached to its underside
and produce a solar change

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.020 align:middle line:10%
to a higher note and see a
rather more complicated figure.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:49.517 align:middle line:90%


00:37:49.517 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How important is sound?

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And what does he
mean by that, Billy?

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:53.608 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: See, it's
very important.

00:37:53.608 --> 00:37:55.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
space time itself,

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:84%
there are these strings
that vibrate and give

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.860 align:middle line:84%
off these frequencies
and vibrations.

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And they run across this like
a wave coming across an ocean.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you look at a cheetah,

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's got these
spots on its back.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, the genetic
makeup of a cheetah

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.440 align:middle line:84%
vibrates at a specific
frequency that's

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:84%
in a match for that pattern
that's being emanated directly

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.280 align:middle line:84%
from spacetime through something
called the flower of life,

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Vesica piscis.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's where these sound
frequencies are emanating from.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:29.020 align:middle line:84%
We can't hear them with our
human ears, but they're there.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when that splashes
across the genetic makeup

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:35.610 align:middle line:84%
of a cheetah, that gives it
the pattern that's on its back.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is the same
thing for every living

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.090 align:middle line:90%
thing on this entire planet.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you are tuned
frequency, vibration,

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.600 align:middle line:84%
your subatomic
frequency vibration

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.270 align:middle line:84%
is a match for, from the
emanating frequencies

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:47.520 align:middle line:84%
or the cymatics coming
out of spacetime,

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.730 align:middle line:84%
that will create your shape,
your form, your figure,

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and also even your perspective
on reality as well.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And all really solid matter
is is these vibrating waves

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.670 align:middle line:84%
that interact with
electromagnetic frequencies

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and then consciousness
comes in and collapses it

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:06.300 align:middle line:84%
into something we consider to be
called digital or solid matter.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: If
a person understands

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.993 align:middle line:84%
this in their day-to-day
life, what can they do?

00:39:10.993 --> 00:39:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: If you
understand this--

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can it
change your life?

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.252 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah, it can change
your life once you really

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:17.400 align:middle line:84%
understand that the
biggest thing about this

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:22.170 align:middle line:84%
is solidity is an illusion,
separation is an illusion.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand that,
it means that we're all one.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.660 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I'm sitting
here talking to you,

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.300 align:middle line:84%
but I'm really
talking to myself.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.837 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to
understand that we're all one,

00:39:30.837 --> 00:39:31.920 align:middle line:90%
the ancients have a term--

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.090 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:34.165 align:middle line:90%
I am another you.

00:39:34.165 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And what it means
is, I'm going to have

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.190 align:middle line:84%
a lot more respect for you as
a human being, as a person,

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.470 align:middle line:84%
as an animal, as an
entity on this planet,

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.788 align:middle line:90%
or anywhere in the universe.

00:39:41.788 --> 00:39:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to treat you
like I would treat myself,

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:45.120 align:middle line:90%
because you are me.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.885 align:middle line:84%
There's only one real
consciousness that exists.

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And we are just
the consciousness

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.320 align:middle line:84%
separated into trillions
and trillions of entities

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.070 align:middle line:84%
so that they can experience
itself subjectively

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.290 align:middle line:90%
from different perspectives.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:56.250 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it wants to
see what it's like to be human.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It wants to see what it's like
to be a blade of grass or even

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.130 align:middle line:90%
a rock.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're here for.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.250 align:middle line:84%
We're on a data
collection mission,

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:03.882 align:middle line:84%
sending information
back to the source.

00:40:03.882 --> 00:40:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this tell
you about the complexity

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:06.930 align:middle line:90%
of life, Billy?

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:12.020 align:middle line:84%
In that not a lot of people
probably are aware of what

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.430 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about today.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:84%
They will be after they
watch this program.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But what does that
tell you about life itself?

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.323 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, it's
a lot more complex.

00:40:20.323 --> 00:40:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that we've
gotten complacent,

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and we've taken a
lot for granted.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.020 align:middle line:84%
The fact that even human
beings are creators ourselves,

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.353 align:middle line:84%
we have the divine energy
inside of us, and we ourselves

00:40:29.353 --> 00:40:30.210 align:middle line:90%
are also creators.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:90%
We even take that for granted.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.960 align:middle line:84%
The fact that everything
that's here, even including

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.050 align:middle line:84%
the TV that people are
watching us on right now,

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:37.372 align:middle line:84%
it all started off as a
thought and then became reality

00:40:37.372 --> 00:40:38.330 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.737 align:middle line:90%
It's manifested from a thought.

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I think we've taken all
of this for granted,

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and we've gone through like
robots through our day.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Wake up, go to sleep, get
married, have kids, go to work,

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:49.007 align:middle line:90%
retire, and die.

00:40:49.007 --> 00:40:50.090 align:middle line:90%
But it's a lot more to it.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I think when you
really understand

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.930 align:middle line:84%
how complex and how
incredible it really is,

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:57.020 align:middle line:84%
it'll take your mind into other
dimensions and other places

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.140 align:middle line:84%
other tangents, and really start
to really appreciate everything

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.640 align:middle line:90%
that's here on another level.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I really want to
appreciate now-- now I

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.015 align:middle line:84%
used to say every second, then
I used to say every microsecond.

00:41:06.015 --> 00:41:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to enjoy
every plonk unit.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:10.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the smallest
measurement of time.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:13.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, I want to enjoy every
single tiny bit that I can

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.470 align:middle line:90%
enjoy in this dimension now.

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we, as
human beings, manifest

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:19.967 align:middle line:90%
everything that happens to us?

00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: We literally do.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:23.133 align:middle line:84%
See, the way the manifestation
works-- and people,

00:41:23.133 --> 00:41:25.327 align:middle line:84%
when I tell people
that they are God,

00:41:25.327 --> 00:41:26.910 align:middle line:84%
some people will get
offended by that.

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.070 align:middle line:84%
But they don't realize
what I'm saying is,

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.120 align:middle line:84%
you have the power
of the creator.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:29.840 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.520 align:middle line:84%
The power of creation is
already inside of you,

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.780 align:middle line:90%
and we do it every single day.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So in a
real world example

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.180 align:middle line:84%
would be, if I want to create,
for example, a cell phone.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So I would think about
the cell phone in my mind.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.273 align:middle line:84%
So that's a
consciousness platform.

00:41:42.273 --> 00:41:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And that platform now, I'm
thinking about the shape, size,

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.460 align:middle line:84%
texture, what it can do,
all the functionality.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:46.910 align:middle line:90%
And I go, OK.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:48.140 align:middle line:90%
I want to manifest this.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.848 align:middle line:84%
Now I take that
information and I give it

00:41:49.848 --> 00:41:51.650 align:middle line:84%
over to our CAD
designer, who brings it

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:53.510 align:middle line:84%
into a two-dimensional
format, which

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:54.940 align:middle line:90%
is all based off of lines.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And then they build it.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And then it
goes to an engineer,

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:84%
which brings it into a
third dimensional platform

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.540 align:middle line:90%
in reality.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.527 align:middle line:84%
So the thought then goes
from thought platform,

00:42:03.527 --> 00:42:05.610 align:middle line:84%
two-dimensional, then to
three-dimensional reality

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.730 align:middle line:84%
where I could physically pick
it up, touch it, and maneuver it

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.080 align:middle line:90%
through the third dimension.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So we manifest everything
in the third dimension

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.710 align:middle line:84%
that way starts
off as a thought.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.590 align:middle line:84%
We literally create things,
just like the universe creates,

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.320 align:middle line:84%
we are also co-creators
in our reality as well.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often are we as
human beings tapping into this

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.100 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is-- the
matrix, let's call it--

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and not even know
that we're doing it?

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's non-stop.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Scientists discovered
that human DNA

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:33.020 align:middle line:84%
get uploaded and downloaded
digital bits of information

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.450 align:middle line:84%
that it sends and receives
information wirelessly,

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.760 align:middle line:84%
like a Wi-Fi signal,
and that we interact

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.580 align:middle line:84%
with each other wirelessly
on a consistent basis.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Also, that DNA stores memories.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of your
memories are stored

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:46.580 align:middle line:84%
in DNA, which is something that
a lot of people don't know.

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.170 align:middle line:90%
This is real science.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So if we're sending and
receiving wireless information

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:84%
and signals directly from
this DNA 24 hours a day,

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.830 align:middle line:84%
seven days a week,
you might get an idea

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.950 align:middle line:84%
pops into your mind about
an invention or an idea.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But really, all those inventions
and ideas all floating around

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.480 align:middle line:84%
in the ether of
space time, you might

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.300 align:middle line:84%
have massive specific frequency
to download that information

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.657 align:middle line:90%
at that moment.

00:43:06.657 --> 00:43:08.240 align:middle line:84%
You were the one who
were lucky enough

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to decipher it and
then bring it to fruition.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like what
Edgar Cayce used to do.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.298 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did most of our
ancients understand this?

00:43:15.298 --> 00:43:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, they understood
it, and they knew all about it.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And there were
minstry schools set up

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.250 align:middle line:84%
for just the elite of the
elites or handpicked people

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.627 align:middle line:84%
that they felt had
specific talents, to be

00:43:24.627 --> 00:43:26.960 align:middle line:84%
able to really analyze it,
understand it, and utilize it

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.000 align:middle line:90%
in the right way for good.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's originally what the
mission schools were all about.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Eventually when these
deified gods left,

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.190 align:middle line:84%
then it started getting twisted
and turned into darkness.

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on all this.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.952 align:middle line:84%
Did science ever catch up with
what they did a long time ago?

00:43:42.952 --> 00:43:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: We're trying.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I really--

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not
there yet, though.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's not there.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at Apple symbol,

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.570 align:middle line:84%
for example, in Africa,
where I visited in person.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.870 align:middle line:84%
It was much further
down the mountain there.

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.923 align:middle line:84%
And it had a specific alignment
where at the solstice,

00:43:56.923 --> 00:43:59.090 align:middle line:84%
the sun would come through
the center of that temple

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and illuminate the
gods at the back.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:01.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Precisely.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: We cut it up in
chunks and moved it up the hill

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.890 align:middle line:84%
because they were
building a dam there.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And the dam was
going to flood it.

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So they knew that we still
want to preserve this.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It needed to
be where it was, right?

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:13.370 align:middle line:84%
They tried to put
it in the same angle

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.173 align:middle line:84%
to get the illumination
right, and they

00:44:15.173 --> 00:44:16.340 align:middle line:90%
were about five degrees off.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.210 align:middle line:90%
They still couldn't get it.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The illumination--

00:44:18.125 --> 00:44:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Didn't work.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's with
modern technology.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.240 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.290 align:middle line:90%
So we're trying.

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:23.558 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
scientists and aerospace

00:44:23.558 --> 00:44:25.100 align:middle line:84%
technicians and
everything else, they

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.780 align:middle line:90%
go to these ancient texts--

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.060 align:middle line:84%
even Hitler went all
around the world scouring

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.793 align:middle line:84%
the planet ancient
texts about technology

00:44:30.793 --> 00:44:32.210 align:middle line:84%
because he wanted
to duplicate it.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, he was
obsessed with the occult

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.790 align:middle line:90%
and the ancient world.

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes, he was.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Obsessed with it.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Because he knew that was
the key to technology.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's all about.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're duplicating or
trying to duplicate everything

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:43.040 align:middle line:90%
that's in these ancient texts.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.870 align:middle line:84%
The more I read ancient
texts, the more I say, wow.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Let me find if
we're doing it now.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:46.880 align:middle line:90%
And I go, oh my god.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.840 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it now.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.215 align:middle line:84%
Transferring conscious-- they
just transferred a monkey's

00:44:50.215 --> 00:44:51.950 align:middle line:90%
consciousness into a computer.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the 2045 project by Ray
Kurzweil in Russia, 2045.com,

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.020 align:middle line:84%
they're working on transferring
human consciousness now

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.790 align:middle line:84%
into an actual biological
avatar by 2045.

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:06.533 align:middle line:84%
The DARPA program is now going
to have a program in America

00:45:06.533 --> 00:45:08.700 align:middle line:84%
where they're transferring
a soldier's consciousness

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.140 align:middle line:90%
into a field robot.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If Hitler
wasn't so insane,

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and if he wasn't so
horrible as a human being,

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.720 align:middle line:84%
god knows how far
the Germans would

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.302 align:middle line:90%
have advanced with technology.

00:45:19.302 --> 00:45:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Oh, they would
have been light years ahead.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
way ahead of us.

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.533 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
so far ahead that we

00:45:24.533 --> 00:45:27.850 align:middle line:84%
decided to take all their
scientists that we--

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
we got to the moon

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.000 align:middle line:90%
because of German scientists.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Basically.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.595 align:middle line:90%
We became the Fourth Reich.

00:45:32.595 --> 00:45:33.720 align:middle line:90%
We took all of them.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.340 align:middle line:84%
People thought it was just
a small amount of scientists

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.298 align:middle line:90%
that we took from them.

00:45:36.298 --> 00:45:38.207 align:middle line:84%
We took over 1,600
people from the Germans.

00:45:38.207 --> 00:45:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so did the
Soviets at the time.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.240 align:middle line:90%
They took some too.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.740 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of people
working on a lot of projects.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And we took them, we put them
in key positions of power

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.977 align:middle line:84%
here in the United
States, as well.

00:45:47.977 --> 00:45:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they had the
V2 rocket way before we even

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:51.370 align:middle line:90%
knew what a rocket was.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:53.766 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:45:53.766 --> 00:45:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And Von Braun was
quoted as saying that we

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:57.300 align:middle line:90%
had help from other people.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, maybe we did.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: There's an old saying
called as above, so below.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, you know,
so in the macrocosm,

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:05.910 align:middle line:90%
so in the microcosm.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything you can look
at on a large scale,

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.850 align:middle line:84%
you can find in
the smallest scale.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.690 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the universe as
a whole, the universe, to me,

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:15.560 align:middle line:84%
is a biological
entity as conscious.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And we are just
another-- a small fractal

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:19.570 align:middle line:90%
of what the universe is.

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at, for
example, a human eye,

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see the retina of
the eye, the iris of the eye,

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.003 align:middle line:84%
and look at a nebula,
you'll see that they

00:46:28.003 --> 00:46:28.920 align:middle line:90%
look almost identical.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting analogy.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:32.910 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a
brain cell and then

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:35.430 align:middle line:84%
look at a zoomed out version
of the universe from billions

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:37.660 align:middle line:84%
of miles away, it looks
like a brain cell.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: You know,
it's really amazing.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:42.420 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the birth of a
cell, a cell's cell division,

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.167 align:middle line:90%
and look at a supernova--

00:46:44.167 --> 00:46:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Same thing.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:47.913 align:middle line:84%
And I just keep going
on and on and on.

00:46:47.913 --> 00:46:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Everything inside of one
blood cell in a human

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.660 align:middle line:90%
is an entire universe.

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:54.785 align:middle line:84%
Everything is needed for
that that one cell to live.

00:46:54.785 --> 00:46:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the power
source and everything else,

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:59.340 align:middle line:84%
it's an entire universe
just like our universe it.

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And then also, if you look at
the multiverse, which we now

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.230 align:middle line:84%
believe scientifically through
quantum physics exists,

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Multi universes.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.407 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Look at the
cells in the human body.

00:47:07.407 --> 00:47:08.475 align:middle line:90%
The cells are all each--

00:47:08.475 --> 00:47:10.293 align:middle line:84%
it's a multiverse
inside of your body.

00:47:10.293 --> 00:47:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's just so many
ways you can go at it.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:14.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, Atom
versus the solar system.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have electrons
orbiting the atom--

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:18.725 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could just
look at-- there are so

00:47:18.725 --> 00:47:20.460 align:middle line:84%
many different
comparisons you can make.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But as above, so below
is really a true thing

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:26.040 align:middle line:84%
that Thoth talks about
in the emerald tablets.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.253 align:middle line:84%
And you can make so
many comparisons to it.

00:47:28.253 --> 00:47:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And you look into
the fact that we

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:32.875 align:middle line:84%
may be living in a fractal
holographic universe,

00:47:32.875 --> 00:47:35.250 align:middle line:84%
if you take a hologram and
take one piece of the hologram

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.190 align:middle line:84%
out and look at it, you're
going to see the entire hologram

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:38.213 align:middle line:90%
in the smallest piece.

00:47:38.213 --> 00:47:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could we
really be living

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:40.865 align:middle line:90%
in a holographic universe?

00:47:40.865 --> 00:47:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I really
do believe so.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:42.765 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:47:42.765 --> 00:47:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And it's talked
about in the emerald tablets.

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:44.933 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not alone.

00:47:44.933 --> 00:47:47.250 align:middle line:84%
People like Elon Musk
believe the same thing.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:48.708 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Yeah,
Elon Musk and a lot

00:47:48.708 --> 00:47:51.540 align:middle line:84%
of other theoretical physicists
as well have come forward now.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.610 align:middle line:84%
James Gates has
talked about this.

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.250 align:middle line:90%
He's a theoretical physicist.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And also he's a master
of supersymmetry.

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.432 align:middle line:84%
And he basically discovered--
him and his team of scientists

00:48:02.432 --> 00:48:04.140 align:middle line:84%
discovered-- that the
ether of space time

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.540 align:middle line:84%
is running off of
something Adinkra codes.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And these Adinkra codes, which
were talked about ironically

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.020 align:middle line:84%
by the Dogon tribe for
many thousands of years,

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.240 align:middle line:84%
are the same exact codes that
we now use in our web browsers

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.592 align:middle line:90%
and search engines.

00:48:16.592 --> 00:48:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So the ether of space
time is running off

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.840 align:middle line:84%
the same code that runs
searches in the websites.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're living inside,
to me, of a creation.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.697 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to look
at the fact of fractals

00:48:26.697 --> 00:48:28.530 align:middle line:84%
through something called
the Mandelbrot set,

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:32.310 align:middle line:84%
you discover that
everything is literally just

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:33.870 align:middle line:90%
a small piece of the whole.

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:35.052 align:middle line:90%
So like I was saying.

00:48:35.052 --> 00:48:37.260 align:middle line:84%
If you take out a piece of
a hologram and look at it,

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:84%
you can see the entire
hologram in the smallest piece.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.220 align:middle line:10%
You only lose resolution.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And it almost seems
as if our reality

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.450 align:middle line:90%
is happening as we need it.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Like in a video game, the
next frame of graphics

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:84%
appears when you get there,
when you need it to show up.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So right now we can't see
our homes, our houses,

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.070 align:middle line:90%
wherever we're from.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So they don't exist as
solid objects right now.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.910 align:middle line:84%
They exist as
electromagnetic waves

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.590 align:middle line:90%
until we physically see them.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Then they collapse back into
a solid structure again.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this mean
that we're not real?

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:05.005 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: No, it
means that we're

00:49:05.005 --> 00:49:07.200 align:middle line:84%
real because
consciousness is real.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.870 align:middle line:84%
But what it means is the third
dimension is an illusion.

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:12.455 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is being
broadcast in from another realm.

00:49:12.455 --> 00:49:13.830 align:middle line:84%
There was a
scientific study done

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:15.270 align:middle line:84%
where they took people
and put them in a room

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and had them look at
images on the screen,

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.530 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted to map
the human brain to see what

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.170 align:middle line:84%
the human brain under
certain feelings and emotions

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:23.758 align:middle line:84%
what it looked
like on a computer.

00:49:23.758 --> 00:49:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Something happened by accident.

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Each image they would
put in 10 seconds apart.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was they were
showing images of serene ocean

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:31.670 align:middle line:90%
views and roses.

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:33.045 align:middle line:84%
And then they
would show somebody

00:49:33.045 --> 00:49:34.305 align:middle line:90%
getting killed or murdered.

00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Now all these
different emotions.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.300 align:middle line:90%
A baby.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is, now the
computer started picking up

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.550 align:middle line:90%
something 7 seconds in advance.

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:43.342 align:middle line:84%
Up to 7 seconds in
advance, the human brain

00:49:43.342 --> 00:49:45.092 align:middle line:84%
was sending to the
computer what was going

00:49:45.092 --> 00:49:46.450 align:middle line:90%
to happen on the next image.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:47.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ahead of time.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And they were
going, wait a minute.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ahead of time.

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Ahead of time.

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.620 align:middle line:90%
We're not in real time.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:55.110 align:middle line:84%
See, our brains have these
crystals inside of them,

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:56.275 align:middle line:90%
magnetite crystals.

00:49:56.275 --> 00:49:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're receiving
a signal, and we're

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.110 align:middle line:84%
decoding this signal into
what we can consider reality.

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know, Bill,
my radio show coast to coast.

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:04.260 align:middle line:84%
We're on a delay,
which means what

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I've said hasn't happened yet
to the people who are listening.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Is that almost like
the same thing?

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Very, very similar.

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Even the fact that we're sitting
here and I'm looking at you,

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.810 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at me,
this close together,

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:16.280 align:middle line:84%
you're not seeing
me in real time.

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The photons are going to
bounce off me, hit your retina,

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.810 align:middle line:84%
go to the back of the brain,
get decoded, and give you

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.160 align:middle line:84%
an illusion of what's
going on outside.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It might
be nanoseconds.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But it's
still not real time.

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Still not real time.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.100 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing me
as I, not as I am.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're living in a
universe that's basically--

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.620 align:middle line:84%
a conscious stream
is being sent in.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.930 align:middle line:84%
These avatar bodies
are encapsulating

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:38.060 align:middle line:84%
part of that consciousness
and decoding it,

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and giving us this
broadcasted hologram

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.920 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on out here.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're maneuvering through
the third dimension that way.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.153 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we've been talking
about the holographic universe.

00:50:48.153 --> 00:50:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Gaia's show, called "Mystery
Teachings" jumps into this,

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.790 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:56.570 align:middle line:10%
>>THERESA BULLARD, PHD: Could
we be living inside a hologram?

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:59.250 align:middle line:10%
What really is a
hologram, anyhow?

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:01.410 align:middle line:10%
Let's explore both the
physics and metaphysics

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:04.200 align:middle line:10%
of holographic being, and
what that means for us.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.560 align:middle line:90%


00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.660 align:middle line:10%
First of all, what
is a hologram?

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.260 align:middle line:10%
We've all seen that shiny image
of a dove on the back of a visa

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.480 align:middle line:10%
credit card, or the
hologram trading

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.240 align:middle line:10%
cards of our favorite
superheroes when we were kids.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.190 align:middle line:10%
These are two-dimensional
films that

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:23.550 align:middle line:10%
have three-dimensional
information encoded in them.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:26.100 align:middle line:10%
And when light shines on
them in the right way,

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.090 align:middle line:10%
we can see the image as if
it is three-dimensional.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:34.500 align:middle line:10%
The word itself gives us
insight into what a hologram is.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.920 align:middle line:10%
It comes from the ancient
Greek words holos and grandma.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.780 align:middle line:10%
Holos means hole.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.360 align:middle line:10%
While grandma means
that which is drawn

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.510 align:middle line:10%
written, as in a
picture, a drawing,

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:47.880 align:middle line:10%
and alphabetical letter,
or a piece of writing that

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.480 align:middle line:10%
contains a message.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:54.460 align:middle line:10%
So a hologram is an image or a
message that depicts the whole.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.780 align:middle line:10%
There are two main defining
features of a hologram.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:02.640 align:middle line:10%
First, every part contains the
same pattern or information

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.810 align:middle line:10%
as the whole.

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:06.630 align:middle line:10%
If we break off a piece
of a holographic plate

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:09.540 align:middle line:10%
and then shine light
onto just that fragment,

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:12.420 align:middle line:10%
it will still contain
the whole image.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:15.270 align:middle line:10%
In this regard, it is
fractal-like or recursive,

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:18.660 align:middle line:10%
meaning it doesn't matter how
small of a scale we go to.

00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:22.560 align:middle line:10%
It will still contain the whole
pattern within each piece.

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:26.700 align:middle line:10%
A large amount of information
is contained in a hologram.

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.400 align:middle line:10%
The second defining
feature is that a hologram

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.160 align:middle line:10%
is a projection from
a lower dimensional

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:35.970 align:middle line:10%
encoding of information about
a higher dimensional reality.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:37.500 align:middle line:10%
An easy way to
think about this is

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.810 align:middle line:10%
what happens when we go
to the movie theater.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:42.810 align:middle line:10%
The movie we see on the
screen is a projection

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:45.930 align:middle line:10%
from light shining through
the film in the movie reel.

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:49.290 align:middle line:10%
That film is imprinted
with images and information

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:51.570 align:middle line:10%
from the studio
recordings of real people

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:53.370 align:middle line:10%
acting out their parts.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.500 align:middle line:10%
The real people are
three-dimensional in this case,

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.120 align:middle line:10%
but the film is two-dimensional.

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.150 align:middle line:10%
And we watched that
movie being projected

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:02.770 align:middle line:10%
onto a two-dimensional
screen as well.

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:04.980 align:middle line:10%
So this example is
not holographic,

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.400 align:middle line:10%
but it gives us an idea of
what is meant by a projection

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.920 align:middle line:10%
from a lower dimensional
encoding of information

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.077 align:middle line:10%
about a higher
dimensional reality.

00:53:13.077 --> 00:53:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, Billy.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So interpret what Theresa
Bullard just said.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, she's saying is
really what a lot of us now are

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:24.450 align:middle line:84%
really starting to come to
realize is the fact that this

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:26.960 align:middle line:84%
entire third dimension
is a projection,

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.030 align:middle line:84%
most likely from possibly what
I consider to be a dodecahedron

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.118 align:middle line:84%
structure outside
of the universe,

00:53:32.118 --> 00:53:33.160 align:middle line:90%
outside of the frame of--

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Created by who?

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.760 align:middle line:90%
The divine creator?

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Possibly the
divine creator or creators.

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:41.148 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're living
in a ancestors civilization.

00:53:41.148 --> 00:53:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So there is a creator
of the universe

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:43.860 align:middle line:84%
because the
mathematics proves it.

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Somebody made them.

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Somebody made them.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
goes many layers, I

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.310 align:middle line:84%
don't think there we're
even close to base reality.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's
many layers to reality

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and many, many universes created
by ancestor civilizations.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.870 align:middle line:84%
For example, the video
game, "The Sims,"

00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.820 align:middle line:84%
they're going to become
conscious with the AI

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:00.840 align:middle line:90%
technology now.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And that video game
has real people in it

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:06.760 align:middle line:84%
that are going to work,
having babies, going

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.220 align:middle line:90%
to parties and everything else.

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.720 align:middle line:84%
At what point would
they then create

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.300 align:middle line:90%
their own simulated universe.

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And then there'll be
one inside of that game.

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's many levels
of reality and many levels

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:20.430 align:middle line:84%
of universes that occur by
creators like ourselves using

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:middle line:84%
this fractal mathematic pattern
that we have rediscovered,

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.330 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And it basically
says that we know

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.440 align:middle line:84%
we're living in a
universe that is created.

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:33.270 align:middle line:84%
However, we are
like a simulation.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.030 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if I took
all the empty space out

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:38.170 align:middle line:84%
of all the atoms on
a 7.5 billion people

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:40.320 align:middle line:84%
are on this planet, I could
fit every single person

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.380 align:middle line:90%
into one sugar cube.

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is all an illusion.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:46.463 align:middle line:90%
We're not even really here.

00:54:46.463 --> 00:54:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does this
do to modern religion?

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:50.297 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think it
destroys modern religion.

00:54:50.297 --> 00:54:53.017 align:middle line:84%
I think that it enhances
spirituality and lets

00:54:53.017 --> 00:54:55.100 align:middle line:84%
you know that you have to
have a divine connection

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.635 align:middle line:84%
with the source, whether
it's god, energy, God,

00:54:57.635 --> 00:54:59.010 align:middle line:84%
you want to call
it the universe.

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you want
to call it, you

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:03.080 align:middle line:84%
can have a direct connection
with that divinity.

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:06.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to go through
these, in my opinion,

00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:08.300 align:middle line:84%
through this religious
system, which

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.510 align:middle line:84%
is more contoured towards
control in the monetary system.

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think that knowledge
of what we're talking about,

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.030 align:middle line:84%
what we're trying to
explain to people here,

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:19.310 align:middle line:84%
will free people
mentally and allow

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:21.290 align:middle line:84%
them to connect to
their true source,

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:23.098 align:middle line:84%
and also to take a
journey to inner space

00:55:23.098 --> 00:55:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and realize that these
are the temples that

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:27.650 align:middle line:84%
need to be visiting, and that
the true power of divinity

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:29.475 align:middle line:84%
is within them
already, and they can

00:55:29.475 --> 00:55:31.100 align:middle line:84%
have a lot more
control over their life

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:31.880 align:middle line:90%
than they really thought.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.740 align:middle line:84%
They've been relinquishing
their control

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.135 align:middle line:84%
and begging and hoping for
things to change and happen

00:55:36.135 --> 00:55:38.510 align:middle line:84%
when they can realize that a
lot of the power and control

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and energy is already
inside of them.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
endowed with it to allow

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.110 align:middle line:84%
themselves to control their
reality tunnel a lot better.

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:47.152 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the message that Thoth

00:55:47.152 --> 00:55:48.260 align:middle line:90%
wanted to convey to us?

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:49.968 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: The biggest
message is the fact

00:55:49.968 --> 00:55:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that mankind has the
capability of not only reaching

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.670 align:middle line:84%
a level that he's on, but
even exceeding that level,

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:56.870 align:middle line:90%
according to him.

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:58.055 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:55:58.055 --> 00:55:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That we can do it?

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:00.347 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: That we can do it.

00:56:00.347 --> 00:56:02.330 align:middle line:84%
That it's already
within us to do it.

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have the capability
to rise up above the darkness

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:08.440 align:middle line:84%
that we're in and get to
a high level of not only

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.750 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, but
civilization, and live

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:14.180 align:middle line:84%
in a pattern of love, of
unconditional love and light

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.920 align:middle line:84%
towards one another,
and that we'll

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.417 align:middle line:90%
become a spacefaring race.

00:56:17.417 --> 00:56:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be able to
travel to other worlds,

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:21.770 align:middle line:84%
not only in this galaxy,
but even in other galaxies.

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does your
research take you next, Billy?

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It takes
me right now into,

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:30.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, I really want to delve
a lot deeper into the sciences

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:32.032 align:middle line:90%
behind spirituality.

00:56:32.032 --> 00:56:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I really want to learn a lot
more about the unified physics

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:36.050 align:middle line:90%
aspect.

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on a
movie right now called

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:40.100 align:middle line:84%
"Chronicles of the
Anunnaki," which

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:42.410 align:middle line:84%
is going to be based off of
ancient texts and tablets

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:44.828 align:middle line:84%
and bringing the real
Star Wars to light,

00:56:44.828 --> 00:56:47.120 align:middle line:84%
going from galactic wars all
the way to the current day

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that we're in over many
episodes or many series.

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:51.675 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really
excited about that.

00:56:51.675 --> 00:56:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking forward to
speaking with Eric Von Daniken

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:55.820 align:middle line:90%
in 2020 in Blackpool, UK.

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.527 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a Nobel Prize
in science for you somewhere?

00:56:58.527 --> 00:56:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: I hope so.

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.650 align:middle line:90%
That would be nice, you know.

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:02.067 align:middle line:84%
I would-- maybe
not a Nobel Prize.

00:57:02.067 --> 00:57:03.530 align:middle line:90%
But just to be recognized.

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing a lot of work,
a lot of countless hours,

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:08.210 align:middle line:84%
a lot of three hour
nights of sleep

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and traveling all around
the world on my own dime

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.663 align:middle line:84%
to try to really bring the
truth to humanity as to what I'm

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:15.830 align:middle line:84%
discovering and what I
believe is going on out there

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:17.497 align:middle line:84%
and letting them make
their own decision

00:57:17.497 --> 00:57:19.790 align:middle line:84%
by providing with enough
research material to say, OK.

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I can check into
what he's saying.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:22.630 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I'm thinking.

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:24.797 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it's matching
up with what I've said.

00:57:24.797 --> 00:57:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you looking
at anything, Billy,

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:29.150 align:middle line:84%
that could be
disruptive to humankind?

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:30.980 align:middle line:10%
Is there anything
out there that you

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:34.100 align:middle line:10%
see that scares the living
daylights out of you that you

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:34.933 align:middle line:10%
haven't told us yet?

00:57:34.933 --> 00:57:37.392 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, the biggest
thing that worries me right now

00:57:37.392 --> 00:57:38.270 align:middle line:90%
is AI--

00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:39.980 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I think in the wrong
hands it could become

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.880 align:middle line:90%
detrimental to the human race.

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Even the Anunnaki themselves
had realized this,

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that by making a very limited
amount of these androids

00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:51.020 align:middle line:84%
that they had created in
these ancient tablets--

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:51.820 align:middle line:90%
they had androids.

00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:54.102 align:middle line:84%
Even Gilgamesh went on a
journey with an android.

00:57:54.102 --> 00:57:55.560 align:middle line:84%
But they had a very
limited amount.

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And when it came down to talking
about making a slave race,

00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:01.475 align:middle line:84%
they decided to go with a
genetic hominid instead of AI

00:58:01.475 --> 00:58:03.350 align:middle line:84%
technology because they
can have more control

00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:05.342 align:middle line:84%
over a biological
entity than they can AI,

00:58:05.342 --> 00:58:06.800 align:middle line:84%
because AI will
become smart enough

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to replicate itself
and realize we

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:12.290 align:middle line:84%
don't need humans or biological
entities, and then take over.

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So my biggest fear
is the fact when

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:16.680 align:middle line:84%
you do have the global net,
Skynet really is active.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And once AI taps into
Skynet, and if these entities

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.733 align:middle line:84%
or these robots become
conscious enough,

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.400 align:middle line:84%
they may want to
eliminate human beings.

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you hopeful
for the future of mankind?

00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I'm very
hopeful for the future.

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:29.770 align:middle line:90%
I really am.

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:32.420 align:middle line:10%
I really do believe that we're
going to rise above all this.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:36.080 align:middle line:10%
These are our lessons as we're
trying to learn how to walk.

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.500 align:middle line:10%
And we're stumbling
a little bit.

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.000 align:middle line:10%
But we will learn how to walk,
and we will learn how to run.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.130 align:middle line:10%
And we will become a much
more conscious civilization.

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:44.980 align:middle line:10%
We're already headed
in that direction now.

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter of
time before we get back

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:47.410 align:middle line:90%
to the golden age.

00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:48.950 align:middle line:84%
We're now like the
pioneers trying

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:50.203 align:middle line:90%
to help mankind get there.

00:58:50.203 --> 00:58:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Billy, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Thank you.

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be back again.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is amazing the
teachings of the ancients.

00:58:56.810 --> 00:59:01.040 align:middle line:10%
And if we could just apply it
to the way we live today, think

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.290 align:middle line:10%
of the kind of planet
we could create.

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000 align:middle line:90%
