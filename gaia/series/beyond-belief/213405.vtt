>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:10%
Paul Wallis is with us, an
internationally bestselling

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.350 align:middle line:10%
author and paleocontact expert.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, he specializes in
researching ancestral narratives

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:84%
for their insight into human
origins and human potential.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.747 align:middle line:84%
What a fascinating
field you're in, Paul.

00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL WALLIS: Good day, George.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely enjoy it, and it's
a pleasure to be with you today.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you came and joined
us from Australia down under.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:90%
A 15-hour flight?

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: It's 13 hours on
the main flight, and then

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:84%
a couple of extra
hours to get here.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you do
on a plane for 13 hours?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I try and read,
and I try and sleep.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you can sleep on a
plane, it's like time traveling.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Oh, it really is.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:10%
I left LA before I left Sydney
because of the time zone

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:10%
differences.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:10%
It's amazing.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what
is a paleocontact?

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Paleocontact
is two-word parts.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:10%
Contact is about contact
with other civilizations.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:10%
Paleo means, in the beginning.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So paleocontact is the
theory that our ancestors

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.592 align:middle line:84%
had contact with other
species in the deep past.

00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when
you say other species,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:90%
what type are we talking about?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: A whole range of
visitors from the stars,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:90%
from different regions.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Star visitors.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Extraterrestrials.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Exactly.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the current
situation with UFOs and ETs?

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: The current
situation would seem

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:90%
to be that we are in contact.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Ancestral narratives suggest
we've always been in contact.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But what makes it so
current is that last year,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
there was a very
public conversation

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.240 align:middle line:84%
between the Pentagon and the US
Congress about present contact.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And what does the
Pentagon know about that?

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are people taking
the ET situation a little more

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:90%
seriously these days?

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me
like they might be.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: I think so.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Progressively, they are.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:90%
And credit where it's due.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:84%
That is in large part
due to the Pentagon,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:84%
which, five years ago now,
came forward and authenticated

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:90%
what's known as The Program.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So for a long time, people who
follow the topic suspected,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
had worked out that the Pentagon
has an R&D department that

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:84%
works to reverse engineer
materials obtained

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:90%
from UFO crashes.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've long
suspected that.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.337 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: We've
long suspected it.

00:02:52.337 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, in 2019, the
Pentagon came clean and said,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:84%
yes, it's true,
and we've had units

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.810 align:middle line:84%
doing that for more
than seven decades.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as that
happened, it really

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
was a signal to people
all around the world

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
to sit up and take notice
and take it seriously

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:84%
because it was an admission
that the UFO phenomenon is real

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and that we have
contact with materials.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And then last year, in
that public conversation,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
we find out it's not just
materials, it's entire craft.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
We now know that 40 witnesses
from the military intelligence

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.980 align:middle line:84%
community gave sworn
testimony to the inspector

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
general of the
intelligence community,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
detailing what has been
retrieved, when, and where.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Entire craft--
where are they now?

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:90%
That information was shared.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The names of the
people who've run

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:84%
the program and the names
of the Pentagon officials

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:90%
who've blocked disclosure.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.980 align:middle line:84%
All that was referred to in
public, in a televised hearing,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:90%
on July the 26th of last year.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So anyone following
the topic now

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
has a whole lot more
to take seriously.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of the
whistleblowers, David Grusch,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
came forward to talk about
biologicals and all kinds

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.740 align:middle line:90%
of incredible things.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Was he risking anything
doing what he did?

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Well, yes, he was.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was attacked
by certain persons

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:84%
within the military
intelligence community.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
They tried to
discredit him and say

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
he's got a mental health
problem, which wasn't the case.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Making everything up?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Yeah, as if
they could discredit him,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.357 align:middle line:90%
then the topic would go away--

00:04:39.357 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: --except
that David Grusch,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
not only was he a
very credible figure,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
he was the lead investigator
for the National Geospatial

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence Agency's
UAP Task Force.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:90%
He had top secret clearances.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:84%
He was doing his work
with Pentagon authority

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.390 align:middle line:84%
in order to feed
back to Congress.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
What he brought
was authenticated

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:90%
by those witnesses.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And Thomas Monheim,
the inspector general

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence
community, said

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that David Grusch's complaint
that he had been blocked

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:84%
was a credible
and urgent matter.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was Thomas Monheim's
work that escalated

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:90%
it to become a public hearing.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: It is, because
we've never had disclosure

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:90%
at this level before.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
We've never had it
in the public domain

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that we have entire craft,
that we have pilots.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
That we are analyzing,
not only metamaterials,

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
but non-human biologics,
to use David Grusch's term.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
Paul Wallis for a moment.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to the beginning.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:84%
What did you do for a career,
and how did you end up

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:90%
doing what you're doing now?

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Yes, my
background surprises people,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
because people know me today
as the paleocontact guy.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But for 33 years, my work
was in church ministry.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So I was an archdeacon for the
Anglican church in Australia.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:90%
That's one down from a bishop.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I was a church doctor,
working with churches

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:90%
in Australia and the UK.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was a
theological educator.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was that last role
really got me into paleocontact

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:84%
because I was teaching pastors
how to interpret ancient texts.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:84%
How do we get out of the
texts what the writers put in

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
instead of misinterpreting
or reading things in.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I applied the skills
I was teaching to pastors, when

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
I applied those
skills to anomalies

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
in the biblical
stories, I realized

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
there was a whole other
layer of story hidden

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:90%
in plain sight in the Bible.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And that when I went to the
root meanings of the key words,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
the story that
emerged turned out

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:84%
to be a summary form of
the ancient stories that

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:90%
came from Mesopotamia--

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.270 align:middle line:84%
so the Sumerian stories,
Babylonian, Akkadian,

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.420 align:middle line:90%
and Assyrian.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And the red pill moment for
me was realizing those stories

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:90%
are not God's stories.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.650 align:middle line:84%
They're stories
about sky people.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to ask
the question, where

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:90%
do I go from here?

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.700 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean that many
of my familiar god stories

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:84%
are actually based on
stories of sky people?

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the 21st century, we have
another word for sky people,

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.020 align:middle line:90%
and it's extraterrestrials.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So, not angels?

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well, angels,
you can use that word.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But the word angel doesn't tell
you what kind of being you're

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:90%
looking at.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.820 align:middle line:84%
The word angel means that
someone on assignment, someone

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
with a message, but it
doesn't tell you biologically

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.130 align:middle line:84%
what they are or what
their genesis is.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So some of the angel stories
from the past, I believe,

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:84%
are stories of visitors from the
stars coming and assisting us.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you
involved in the transition

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:84%
from the ministry to
where you are today?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: I suffered an injury.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
In my first paleocontact
book, I refer to it

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
as an ultimate frisbee injury,
where I got injured in a game

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:90%
and I'm invalided out.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You got
hurt playing frisbee?

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Ultimate frisbee
is rougher than frisbee.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.757 align:middle line:90%
It's like frisbee plus--

00:08:21.757 --> 00:08:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm not
putting you down now.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:84%
What I mean, would somebody
flip something at you

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and hit you in
the head, or what?

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: What
happened was my arch

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:84%
collapsed because I wasn't
wearing the right footwear

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.509 align:middle line:90%
and it stretched the ligament.

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: And it created
a terrible problem.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I didn't work out for
ages when it happened.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to
do a lot of work

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:84%
to correct the damage, which
is now affecting my hip, now

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:90%
affecting my shoulders.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I talk about this
period where I'm invalided out

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.930 align:middle line:90%
between pastorates.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And that gave me the
opportunity to go back

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to all these funny little
anomalies in the Bible.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Things like, why does
God say, let us make?

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Who's the us?

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Let us make the humans to look
like one of us-- one of who?

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
All those sorts of questions
that preachers bump up against.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think, I must
get back to that

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and work out what's
going on there.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:90%
And I finally did.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I discovered
the Sumerian stories

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and realized there's
other information here

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:90%
that we've missed.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know Lionel
Fanthorpe any chance, who is

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:90%
an Anglican minister himself?

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: No, I don't.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's from
England, of course,

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and but he has written
incredible stories.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get him
on the show one day.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
His health has been
waning a little bit.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well, look, there
are some great theologians

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:90%
in the Anglican world.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about Pope
Benedict's symposium on ETs.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well, that
was an amazing moment,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and it was something
that caught my attention.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And it made me think, I have
to get back to these anomalies

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:90%
and study them.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I had suspected for a long time
there might be ETs in the Bible.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
But what happened in 2009
was that Pope Benedict, who

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
was the most conservative
pope in my lifetime,

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:84%
blew me away when he
called on the Pontifical

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Academy of Sciences to
hold a symposium, which

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:90%
was called a colloquium.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's the top theologians,
top scholars coming together

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:90%
to discuss--

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and they made it public
what they were discussing--

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
the theological
implications of contact

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:90%
with other civilizations.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
said, belief in ETs

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
does not negate
your belief in God.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: That's exactly right.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And he had top authorities step
forward, do press conferences.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And we had about a year's
lead in where everybody

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:90%
knew this was going to happen.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And before and after, we heard
the experts for the Vatican

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:84%
say we should not be surprised
to encounter extraterrestrials

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.660 align:middle line:84%
because they're in
the Bible, they're

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.090 align:middle line:84%
in the Old Testament
and the New Testament.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Monsignor
Balducci, I think.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Monsignor Balducci
said something very powerful.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
He said, people who
have had close encounter

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:84%
experiences, he said those
are not demonic experiences

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
psychotic breaks.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Those are encounters with a
totally different kind of being,

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:90%
one that merits serious study.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it was Father
Gabriel José Funes, who

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:84%
was the director of the
Vatican Observatory,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.410 align:middle line:84%
said we should be ready to
embrace brother and sister

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:90%
aliens.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.918 align:middle line:84%
Their presence just
means the creator has

00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:90%
been busier than we thought.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the signal was, we
should be ready for contact.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.158 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to
set the expectation.

00:11:39.158 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:84%
This could be happening,
and the phrase they used

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.528 align:middle line:90%
was, sooner than anyone expects.

00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.112 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: And they
didn't want people

00:11:46.112 --> 00:11:48.830 align:middle line:84%
to be blown out of the
water with this realization.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:84%
They needed to know
that the concept of God

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.980 align:middle line:84%
is big enough to embrace
a populated cosmos.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
must love what you do.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: I do.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:90%
It really energizes me.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the
part of my career

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:84%
that I've enjoyed more than
anything else I've done.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paleocontact
is an interesting word.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Is it a new phrase?

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I can't remember
where I first heard it.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:90%
I find it--

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
hear it a lot.

00:12:15.975 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: No.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a helpful word
because when people ask me,

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
If I say paleocontact, they
then ask me to explain it.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.987 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over their head and--

00:12:26.987 --> 00:12:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: So it's
better for me to say

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:90%
that than to say aliens, UFOs.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Because for some people, that's,
OK, I'm not going to listen now.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.827 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
turnoff to some.

00:12:36.827 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: It can be.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But to many,
maybe it is not either.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: No.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I think given
permission, far more

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
people are interested and aware
of than we would ever imagine.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do you think
there's this interest with ETs

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:90%
coming here?

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I think there are
a number of reasons now.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
My field is really
ancestral narratives.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.552 align:middle line:90%
Indigenous stories--

00:13:00.552 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is what?

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: So when we listen to
folklore from around the world,

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
so the things that are
not taught in school

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:84%
but are carried by the
traditional cultures,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:84%
that's where you have this
other layer of information.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about visitors
coming for all kinds of reasons.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So they talk about
colonization in the past

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
by beings who came here
because they wanted

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.180 align:middle line:84%
to exploit Earth in the same way
we invade each other's countries

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
But then others who
came to help us,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
to help the human race to
evolve and progress and make

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.820 align:middle line:90%
great leaps forward.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's this whole
spectrum of experiences

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:84%
referenced by our
ancestors in the deep past.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And I find that gives a
very different perspective

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
on what might be
happening in the present.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There is a video
that came out a year

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and a half ago
called the Tic Tac

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:84%
UFOs taken by pilots
from the USS Nimitz

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.220 align:middle line:90%
off the coast of California.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, objects that
are buzzing and zooming.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.210 align:middle line:90%
What do you think that was?

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: It's
fascinating listening

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
to the pilots who were deployed
to engage with those craft.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't-- the abilities of
those craft far exceed anything

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:90%
we have.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maneuvers
were incredible.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Absolutely, and
it's amazing to watch it.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So many people have been able
to see that now on YouTube.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And what the pilots were saying
is, first of all, these crafts

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:84%
seem to ping into our
airspace as if from nowhere.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And that suggests
they've mastered

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:90%
space-time manipulation.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the way they moved
in the sky, they said,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
was almost like a creature,
almost like an insect.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if
they were dealing

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:84%
with something that
was alive rather

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
than a piece of technology
that was being piloted.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that relates
very interestingly to what

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
some of the
physicists are saying

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
who are working in
the program right

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:84%
now trying to reverse-engineer
materials from craft like that.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know of
something called The Program?

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Yes, The
Program is the nickname,

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.340 align:middle line:84%
as it were, of the
Pentagon's R&D department

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:84%
seeking to reverse-engineer
what they call metamaterials.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And so Eric W. Davis is one of
the physicists working on that.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about off-world
vehicles not made on this Earth.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
We're studying those craft,
we're studying the fabric

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.970 align:middle line:84%
from which they're
made, and we're

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.650 align:middle line:90%
trying to reverse-engineer it.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:84%
The Program is the
name for that R&D work.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late Colonel Philip
Corso talked about reverse

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:84%
engineering that happened
way back in the 1940s.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Was it really going on then?

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: I believe so.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:90%
We retrieved materials in 1947--

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Roswell.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: --from Roswell.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cape Girardeau.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: So clearly, we've
been working on those.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
But in my book, "The
Invasion of Eden,"

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.190 align:middle line:84%
I suggest that human beings have
been trying to reverse-engineer

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
alien tech for
thousands of years.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And I find hints of that in
the Bible and hints of it

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.170 align:middle line:90%
in Mayan story.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was this
reverse-engineered technology,

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Paul, given to us, or
did we stumble into it?

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Oh, that's
a great question.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I think in the present, we
have been given some stuff.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not just crashes and
we've picked up pieces.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.960 align:middle line:84%
I think we've been
given some materials

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.800 align:middle line:90%
to work with in the present.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:84%
I think in the past,
it was not that way.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.620 align:middle line:84%
It was things we
stumbled across,

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
things we saw our visitors
using, and we thought,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:90%
we want to do that.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.510 align:middle line:90%
We want to know how to fly.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We want to know how to
do remote communication.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And so there are clues that
the [NON-ENGLISH] dynasty

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:84%
in the Yucatan Peninsula were
trying to engineer a Bluetooth

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:90%
device, for instance.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Or in the Bible, we have
the Urim and Thummim,

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
which they tried to reproduce
a communications device they'd

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.359 align:middle line:90%
seen the Elohim used.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But in the present,
I think what's

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:90%
happening is collaboration.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
pretty significant voices

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
who have spoken in those
terms in the last few years.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think every
president of the United States

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:84%
was aware of this
relationship with ETs?

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: No.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
I think President
Truman was aware.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I think President
Eisenhower was aware.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And from that time
to this, we've

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:84%
had layers and layers
of top secret protocols

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
which have kept a
lot of information,

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.360 align:middle line:90%
even from US presidents.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
presidents have asked

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:84%
to have a full briefing on
ET contact on The Program.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And they've been told, that's
on a need-to-know basis, sir,

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:90%
and they've not been told.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: After FDR passed
and Truman became president,

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and of course, was the
one who dropped the bomb

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:90%
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Might that have been
an impetus for the ETs

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:90%
to want to get a hold of him?

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:90%
How did he get involved in this?

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I think
it was because it

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:84%
was after the nuclear
detonations at Trinity,

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Nagasaki, Hiroshima.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, our
airspace was full of UFOs.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:48.770 align:middle line:84%
There was a massive acceleration
of contact experiences.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And of course, within months of
the Roswell incident in 1947,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.650 align:middle line:84%
President Truman is signing
the National Security Act,

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:05.740 align:middle line:84%
which set up all the protocols
for making research into the UFO

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon top secret.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And he signed that
act, funnily enough,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.110 align:middle line:84%
off planet on Air
Force One of the day,

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:90%
a plane called the Sacred Cow.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
done because they

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
knew they needed to press
on and to understanding

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.080 align:middle line:90%
what was happening.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I think there was contact at
a covert government level,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:84%
but it all had to be
behind closed doors.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There were rumors that
then-President Eisenhower was

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:84%
the one who
initiated the program

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:90%
and actually met with the ETs.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard or
uncovered anything there?

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I talk about this
in "The Invasion of Eden."

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've got an endorsement on
the cover from Laura Eisenhower

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:84%
just to clue people
that I'm going there.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I go to that story
because it's been

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:84%
an urban legend for a
long time, that Eisenhower

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:84%
had a face-to-face
meeting with visitors

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and that he established
the alliances that

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.050 align:middle line:84%
had been in place from
that time to this.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:11.120 align:middle line:84%
My impression is he was being
read into a matrix of agreements

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:84%
that had already been made,
decisions that had been

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.905 align:middle line:90%
made under President Truman.

00:20:17.905 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
read the Bible,

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
you see strange events that have
happened-- the tower of Babel,

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:90%
Were these ET involvements?

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: I believe they were.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Bible talks about
these mysterious beings,

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:90%
the Elohim.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And that word is often
translated as god,

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
but at root, it means
the powerful ones.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And as a group, they're
summarized as the savior

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:84%
hashamayim, that
means the sky armies.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So that gives us an idea,
that first impression.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we're given details
of the weaponry that they had,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:84%
the [NON-ENGLISH] the
[NON-ENGLISH] which were weapons

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.760 align:middle line:90%
of mass destruction in effect.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And you have the stories
that you just mentioned,

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:84%
where entire cities are
bombed into oblivion.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And in Genesis 11, the Tower
of Babel, a whole civilization

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:90%
bombed into oblivion.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And the Babel story, when you
read that alongside the Sumerian

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
version, you realize what
we're looking at is not

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:84%
a building that's breached
building codes because it's

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:90%
too tall.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.040 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
looking at a stargate.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:33.000 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at planet Earth
moving into a spacefaring era,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and then visiting Elohim
say, we don't want that.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And they bomb that
civilization out of existence

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:84%
as if they don't want
that staging post

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:90%
in this part of the galaxy.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they gave us
fair warning, too, did they?

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.935 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I would
not say there's

00:21:49.935 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:84%
any such thing as a fair
warning when they're

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:84%
going to obliterate
your civilization, which

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:90%
is what they did.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And some people might look at
that and think, oh, my goodness,

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.130 align:middle line:90%
is that us today?

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Because we're on the brink
of becoming spacefarers.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to be invaded?

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to be bombed?

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think, no, we're in a more
interesting period of history

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've got
more helpers on the scene

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:90%
now than we had in Genesis 11.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, where
are they coming from?

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiades, the
Sirius star system,

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:90%
where are they coming from?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.540 align:middle line:10%
>>WALLIS: Well, you've mentioned
two of the top three regions

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.020 align:middle line:10%
of space that our ancestors
spoke about when they talked

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:10%
about visitors or invaders.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was blown away when I
was reading the book of Job.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.600 align:middle line:84%
When I was researching
for "Escaping from Eden,"

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
the book of Job, many
scholars believe,

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:90%
is the oldest book in the Bible.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Some scholars
believe it's actually

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:84%
an Arabic piece of
literature that's

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.370 align:middle line:90%
found its way into the Bible.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's a verse
in that book that

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
talks about power dynamics
between Earth and Sirius, Earth

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and the Pleiades,
Earth and Orion.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I read that
verse, my jaw dropped.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Because as I listened
to Indigenous narratives

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:84%
from around the world, those
are the three regions of space

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:90%
that keep getting mentioned.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
What's exciting to me about
that is that the Pleiades,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
they are always mentioned
in ancestral story

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:84%
as the place from
which our helpers came.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
When they talk about
our great leaps

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
forward in material science,
our great leap forward

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
into agriculture or becoming
city builders, civilization

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:84%
builders, the Pleiades is
where our helpers came from.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they have
a parental relationship

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
towards us, and I think
that's still in place today.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, what can you tell
us about the Israeli Brigadier

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.380 align:middle line:84%
General Haim Eshed,
who has talked

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:57.500 align:middle line:84%
about a relationship
between ETs and humankind?

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well, he is
a fascinating figure.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:84%
He was, for 28 years, Israel's
chief of space security.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.250 align:middle line:90%
He oversighted the--

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was the guy.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: He was the guy to
know if we were in company,

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and if that
represented a threat.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And then just before Christmas
2020, he stepped up to the mic

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and he said on the basis of
his privileged information

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.300 align:middle line:84%
over those 28 years,
his understanding

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.200 align:middle line:84%
is that we are already in
contact at a covert government

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.950 align:middle line:84%
level, and he specified
the governments of the USA

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:90%
and of Israel.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And that we've been
involved in collaborations

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.710 align:middle line:90%
for more than 70 years.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What took him so long?

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I think he had to
reach an age where he was no

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:51.957 align:middle line:84%
longer frightened, where he
had made his contribution--

00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He wouldn't
lose his pension.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: --he wouldn't
lose his pension,

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.590 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't lose his job, he's
not looking for promotion.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think, finally,
he felt free enough

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that he could say, look,
this is my understanding.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But he said, as part
of his statement,

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.980 align:middle line:84%
if he had made this statement
only a few years before,

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:84%
he would expect to have been
ferried off to a hospital.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:84%
But things have
shifted, and there

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is more disclosure happening
all around the world that

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:84%
meant not only could
he make that statement,

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.620 align:middle line:84%
but he could publish an
entire book on the topic--

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:84%
"The Universe
Beyond The Horizon."

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:25:26.675 --> 00:25:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: It's a
great title, isn't it?

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sure is.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: And he talks
about collaboration.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And, again, that suggests, no,
we're not about to be invaded,

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
something more
interesting is going on.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
a potential here

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:84%
for us to experience
another massive leap forward

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.880 align:middle line:84%
as the human race
because we have

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.990 align:middle line:90%
this kind of contact happening.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, if
disclosure comes,

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:90%
will it come from governments?

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Will it come from the ETs?

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Where do you think it will come?

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well, this
was another thing

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
very interesting about
what Haim Eshed said,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:84%
because his understanding
is that the policy

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of non-disclosure is defined
at the level of our ET visitors

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and at the level of
covert government.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Our visitors are saying
they won't self-disclose

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:19.460 align:middle line:84%
until you and I have a better
understanding of what space is

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:90%
and what spaceships are.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's a hint that
they're waiting for us

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
to reach a technological bar
where we can reverse-engineer

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:84%
these materials that
enable us to make

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.750 align:middle line:90%
interstellar travel possible.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Once we do that, we change from
being the studied, the observed,

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:42.690 align:middle line:84%
the abducted, to being
fellow spacefarers.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And when our visitors see that
has happened, that we've all

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
been brought into
that picture, that

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:84%
is when they expect
to self-disclose.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's a bit of a
subtle dance between the two

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:90%
in defining when that happens.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to be a
concern by some of our Congress

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:90%
people about all of this.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
What have you heard
in that arena?

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well, certainly at
that hearing on July 26 in 2023,

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:84%
we heard from
members of Congress

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:16.600 align:middle line:84%
who were concerned that what we
are seeing when we watch the Tic

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Tacs, for instance, could
represent a military threat.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they asked
the witnesses--

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
David Fravor, Ryan
Graves, David Grusch--

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:84%
do these craft represent
a military threat?

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:90%
And they had to say potentially.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Potentially because we
can't shoot them down.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: But it's
us shooting at them.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not the other way around.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, I think that
what we're experiencing

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.750 align:middle line:84%
suggests a more
benevolent contact

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:90%
than many people are fearing.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:54.230 align:middle line:84%
But we did hear from Tim
Burchett, Andy Ogles questions

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
really along the lines of,
how scared should we be?

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And in "The Invasion of
Eden," I'm saying, yes,

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.050 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors spoke about
scary things, invasions.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at the whole
spectrum of their experiences,

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of
positive that flowed

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.220 align:middle line:84%
from our contact
with our visitors--

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:84%
massive leaps forward
in technology,

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.380 align:middle line:84%
in culture, and
even in heightening

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.370 align:middle line:90%
our cognitive abilities.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we do
more careful diplomacy

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.980 align:middle line:84%
with our visitors, think
carefully about all the factions

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.020 align:middle line:84%
who may be present,
the potential is there

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:90%
for another great leap forward.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
should be looking for.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying how
scared should we be,

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the question should
be, how do we

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:84%
leverage this moment
in a way that is

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.940 align:middle line:90%
good for the whole of humanity?

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not every culture
thinks these visitations

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.230 align:middle line:90%
are hunky-dory and friendly.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:57.660 align:middle line:84%
The Hawaiians, for example,
talk of ancient invasions

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:90%
and abductions.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.930 align:middle line:84%
What have you
heard in that area?

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well, the abduction
narrative is global.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.620 align:middle line:84%
You can go to any
culture in the world

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and you will hear, at the
folkloric level, stories

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.350 align:middle line:90%
of abduction.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So Scotland, for
instance, in the 1600s,

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Robert Kirk wrote about
abductions that were being

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.310 align:middle line:90%
experienced at that time.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's disturbing,
that's worrying.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned the
Hawaiian narratives of Mo'o.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:35.460 align:middle line:84%
When I listen to traditional
guardians of Hawaiian culture,

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.150 align:middle line:84%
when they talk about the coming
of the Mo'o, what's interesting

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.160 align:middle line:90%
is they talk about invasion.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:84%
But not in terms of
craft in the sky,

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:90%
they talk about cultural shifts.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And they say, if there's
been a covert invasion,

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:55.480 align:middle line:84%
an annexation, then just
watch out for these things.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about separating
people from the land

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.290 align:middle line:84%
to the point where we can't
live so independently,

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:90%
so self-sufficient.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.400 align:middle line:84%
They talk about an
atomization of society,

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:84%
where people are
polarized and live

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.430 align:middle line:90%
in competition with each other.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:84%
They talk about a
shift of society

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.980 align:middle line:84%
where we no longer
work for each other,

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.070 align:middle line:84%
we are all working
for superiors.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Where there's a machinization
of how populations are managed.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And the stories of
the Mo'o say, look

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:84%
out for that, beware of
that, but remember the power

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.560 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:84%
We can build our culture
from the grassroots up.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to have
everything defined

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.090 align:middle line:84%
by the 1% of the 1%,
whether they're ETs

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:90%
or bankers or anyone else.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a 17th
century Scottish Presbyterian

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.040 align:middle line:90%
minister named Robert Kirk.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.010 align:middle line:84%
What was his
involvement in this?

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well, I find
Robert Kirk fascinating.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:59.050 align:middle line:84%
He, like me, was a minister
and had a great enthusiasm

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.010 align:middle line:90%
for Bible translation.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:06.010 align:middle line:84%
He was a Presbyterian minister
in Aberfoyle, Scotland.

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:09.760 align:middle line:84%
This was a very conservative
time, the 1600s.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Presbyterian church--

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Way back.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Way back.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And Presbyterian was
pretty conservative.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And they observed his
Bible translations,

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:23.190 align:middle line:84%
which they said were a bit too
open-minded for the Presbyterian

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.990 align:middle line:90%
church.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And what they meant by
that he went to the root

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.260 align:middle line:84%
meanings of key
words and produced

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:33.010 align:middle line:84%
stories that sounded a lot
less religious and a bit more

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:33.950 align:middle line:90%
mystifying.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So that was his
white rabbit that

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.400 align:middle line:84%
led him into the topic of
paleocontact in the Bible.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But the other aspect
was he was a pastor,

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and he listened to the
experience of the locals.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that
when the locals talked

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:84%
about elves, fauns,
fairies, they weren't

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.570 align:middle line:90%
telling cute bedtime stories.

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:84%
They were telling stories
about experiences they

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.347 align:middle line:84%
and their ancestors had had
that really worried them.

00:32:03.347 --> 00:32:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were scared.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:05.555 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: They were scared.

00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:84%
They were scared
about abduction.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.390 align:middle line:84%
They were scared about an
influence on government

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:90%
that seemed to be non-human.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And they spoke
about the Sith, who

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.000 align:middle line:84%
had no compassion
towards human beings,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.200 align:middle line:84%
but seemed to have this great
influence over kings and queens

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.440 align:middle line:90%
and parliaments.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.680 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't like it.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.060 align:middle line:90%
They were worried by it.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Kirk was
really their champion

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:90%
in making those stories public.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote this book,
"The Secret Commonwealth,"

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:84%
in which he argued that no
understanding of the world is

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:42.380 align:middle line:84%
complete until we realize
there is a non-human layer

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.120 align:middle line:84%
to the management
of Project Earth.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very brave
thing that he did given

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.680 align:middle line:90%
the period when he was writing.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Paul, you're involved
in a film with Matthew LeCroy.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Oh, yes.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.130 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
be a great year.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So Matt and I and a
team of researchers

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:05.250 align:middle line:84%
will be traveling to Egypt,
Turkey, Bolivia, and Peru.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And we're probing
the information

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.390 align:middle line:84%
that is recorded
in the artifacts

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:84%
of those ancient cultures
and in the carvings

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.650 align:middle line:90%
that they've left behind.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, I'm really
interested in what we're going

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.400 align:middle line:90%
to find in ancient Armenia.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.950 align:middle line:90%
And I've come to believe--

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Armenia, how come?

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Ah, well, so much
happened in ancient Armenia.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:84%
It has one of the world's
most ancient languages.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's information carried
by the language itself.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the place I believe
Abraham came from in the Bible,

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.090 align:middle line:84%
which is quite a controversial
thing for me to say,

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:84%
but I argue this in
"The Invasion of Eden."

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the carved
symbology in ancient Armenia,

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I believe it gives us eyes on
what the Elohim of the Bible

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.590 align:middle line:84%
looked like, what the Anunna
of the Sumerian stories

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:58.770 align:middle line:90%
looked like.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.910 align:middle line:84%
We're in the region
of Haldi, so this

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:05.060 align:middle line:84%
is Ur of Haldi, the
high place of Haldi.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they look like?

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:11.659 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Some of them looked
very much like us, but bigger.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Some of them had avian
features, some of them

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.340 align:middle line:90%
had reptilian features.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.739 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Insectoids?

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: No insectoids
that I've spotted to date.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
about these figures

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:27.120 align:middle line:90%
is what they were doing.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And it seems, when you go
to the figure of Haldi,

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.530 align:middle line:90%
he's doing a number of things.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:84%
First of all, he's
arrived as a colonizer.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:84%
His name means taken,
so he's a conqueror.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But when we look
at the symbology,

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.219 align:middle line:84%
it looks like he's rebooting
the ecology of the region.

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:46.699 align:middle line:84%
It looks like he's providing
a cognitive upgrade

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.239 align:middle line:90%
for the people who live there.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And he's doing it in
the place associated

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:56.270 align:middle line:84%
with our planet's repopulation
after the most recent planetary

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:57.980 align:middle line:90%
cataclysm.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the ET
contacts friendly or not?

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I think there is
always a mix of experience.

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you talk to present
experiences, experience-ers,

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.850 align:middle line:84%
some people will
describe encounters

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:84%
that were harrowing
and terrifying,

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to talk about it

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want
to remember it.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But a great many talk about
experiences that were elevating,

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:30.970 align:middle line:90%
inspiring.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And after those
experiences, many people

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.710 align:middle line:84%
have heightened
cognitive abilities.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.470 align:middle line:84%
They have experiences
of precognition.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Kirk,
writing in the 1600s,

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:45.060 align:middle line:84%
observed exactly
the same phenomenon.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of contact
happening in the present, just

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.110 align:middle line:84%
the same as in the past, that
suggests a benevolent presence

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:56.440 align:middle line:84%
here to support humanity
through whatever changes

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.880 align:middle line:90%
might be down the track.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you read the Bible
and inject ET visitations

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:07.320 align:middle line:84%
instead of biblical phrases,
it makes a lot of sense,

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.120 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: It does.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And all you've got to
do, a lot of the time,

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.510 align:middle line:84%
is leave certain
terms untranslated.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you leave
Elohim untranslated,

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Yahweh untranslated, El
Shaddai untranslated,

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Ruach, Kavod, there are
these other key words.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and then watch how those
words behave in the text,

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:32.270 align:middle line:84%
it becomes very
clear when you're

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.300 align:middle line:84%
looking at an invasion, when
you're looking at colonization,

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.770 align:middle line:84%
when you're looking
at a human upgrade.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is when the
ancient stories really

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:42.150 align:middle line:90%
resurface in the Bible.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the Bible is
one of the most rich sources

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:50.690 align:middle line:84%
of paleocontact story
that we have in the world.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The witnesses
saw amazing things

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.720 align:middle line:90%
and they put them in the Bible.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Yes, they did.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And what they
describe is described

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:90%
in other cultural tellings.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:07.310 align:middle line:84%
You can go to Nigeria, you
can go to the Zulu people,

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:10.440 align:middle line:84%
go to Mesoamerica, go
to the Philippines.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.200 align:middle line:84%
You will hear the
same stories repeat.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And it fascinates
me because it's not

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.680 align:middle line:84%
a story that's gone around
the world in Chinese whispers.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.620 align:middle line:84%
They all have their own
language, their own metaphor.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me, they
all saw the same thing

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and experienced similar
things and found their own way

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.800 align:middle line:90%
to carry that memory.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.442 align:middle line:84%
And it's the overlap that
really gets my attention.

00:37:34.442 --> 00:37:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
biblical stories

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:41.000 align:middle line:84%
about benevolent ET contact,
or some serious invasions?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: The whole spectrum
is there in the Bible.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand, you've got
the savior hashamayim, the sky

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:84%
armies with all their
weaponry, but then you've

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.420 align:middle line:84%
also got stories of beings
like Dagon and Asherah.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And Asherah is the
Hebrew memory of helpers

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:02.300 align:middle line:84%
who came and taught us what
plants are good for food, which

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.670 align:middle line:84%
are good for medicines,
which are good to avoid,

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:06.840 align:middle line:84%
which are good for
higher consciousness.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Asherah taught us how to farm
and build cities and become

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.120 align:middle line:90%
a civilization.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole
spectrum of experiences

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.190 align:middle line:90%
is there in the Bible.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And the authors guaranteed
that information will never

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.110 align:middle line:90%
be forgotten.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
it's a mixed bag.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: It's a very mixed bag.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can people,
Paul, influence

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:32.000 align:middle line:84%
what's happening behind closed
doors with these ET stories?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Or are they just
left on the outside?

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: That's
a great question.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look at the
secrecy around The Program,

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.730 align:middle line:84%
we can feel very
disempowered and think, well,

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.660 align:middle line:84%
what can I do to define whether
it's a great leap forward

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.920 align:middle line:90%
or an invasion?

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But what our ancestors say, and
you can find this in the Bible

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.130 align:middle line:84%
as well, is that
contact isn't just

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:58.910 align:middle line:84%
happening behind closed
doors with corporate types

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:00.860 align:middle line:90%
and politicians.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:05.450 align:middle line:84%
From the grassroots up, people
are having contact experiences

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.440 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need to take
that seriously and realize

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that the company we have
is interested in all of us,

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:84%
is interested in
progressing our experience.

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we can engage
with that from the grassroots

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:26.160 align:middle line:84%
up, that's the best way we can
do what's called exopolitics.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the best way
we can do diplomacy.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't just have to
leave it to the higher ups

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:32.580 align:middle line:90%
to get everything right.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think
the abduction situation is?

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.140 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I think it's happening
for a number of reasons.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.670 align:middle line:84%
There are stories
told that suggest

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.210 align:middle line:84%
that visitors have come
here because they find

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.370 align:middle line:90%
human beings very attractive.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:52.750 align:middle line:90%
So in Genesis--

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We are.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: I think we're hot.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:84%
In Genesis 6, it says
that, explicitly,

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that the Bene Elohim
found human females hot.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we want some
of that in our gene pool.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Why do they want what we
have in their gene pool?

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I happen to think
there's something

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:17.770 align:middle line:84%
unique about the blend of
animal strength, mammal

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:21.850 align:middle line:84%
emotion, our capacity
to carry consciousness

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that is very attractive
to some of our visitors.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's either that they
have a small gene pool

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and they need to
strengthen their species,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.180 align:middle line:84%
or that they've been
here quite a long time

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and they want their descendants
to be better adapted for Earth

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.260 align:middle line:90%
than they are.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily that
they're wanting to take over.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.770 align:middle line:84%
They just want their descendants
to have an easier time on Earth

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:46.290 align:middle line:90%
than they've had.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And those two aspects, I
think, are part of the story.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
covert relationship, Paul,

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.900 align:middle line:84%
between the ETs and
government as it directly

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.930 align:middle line:84%
relates to the alien
abduction phenomenon?

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well,
that's a good question

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.000 align:middle line:84%
because when Haim Eshed
talked about collaborations

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and supporting our
visitor's research,

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.170 align:middle line:84%
that was my first question--
research into what?

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Is that research into us?

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Is that an abduction
agreement that's been made?

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have any
information on that.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I just suspect that is
part of the picture.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's unfriendly.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Yes, it is unfriendly.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Except when you listen
to stories, for instance,

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.650 align:middle line:84%
out of Kenya or Ghana, when
they tell their stories

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of abduction-- it's the
same in Wales as well,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.910 align:middle line:90%
and the Philippines--

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:45.720 align:middle line:84%
they say that the people who are
taken are not taken by force.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:52.990 align:middle line:84%
That the visitors who meet
them are beautiful visitors

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:57.080 align:middle line:84%
who lure people with
promises of advancement.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.760 align:middle line:90%
You'll have an amazing time.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.010 align:middle line:84%
We'll go places you
couldn't imagine.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And when people
come back, which is

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.040 align:middle line:84%
the amazing thing about
the experience in Ghana,

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.860 align:middle line:84%
for instance, this is
the Mami Wata tradition.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And I have very close
contact with people

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.740 align:middle line:90%
who've had these experiences.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.280 align:middle line:84%
They come back saying,
actually, I like our visitors.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I hated the fact, I
couldn't contact my family

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.310 align:middle line:84%
for the three years I was
away, but they're actually

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:25.670 align:middle line:90%
beautiful people.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:29.140 align:middle line:84%
They were actually very
beautiful and gentle with me.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Other than the fact I had
to be there for three years

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and I had to have
children while I was away.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's a blended story.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not a black-and-white
story of goodies and baddies.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a more subtle
story than that.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Difficult for us to
do business with.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And when people come
back saying those things,

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.700 align:middle line:90%
it confuses their families.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And they think this is Stockholm
syndrome, where you fall

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.630 align:middle line:90%
in love with the kidnapper.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.870 align:middle line:84%
But that's the story
many return with.

00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:00.720 align:middle line:84%
That they are beautiful visitors
and actually quite like them,

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and I missed them now
that I'm not with them.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are people being taken
though without their will?

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I think if
we listen to the story

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:16.280 align:middle line:84%
of the Mo'o and the Ahumanu
from out of Hawaii, that

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.920 align:middle line:84%
suggests some people are
taken against their will.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that's a
different demographic

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.460 align:middle line:90%
that we're dealing with.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's,
again, why it's important

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:30.020 align:middle line:84%
that we recognize we've got
a spectrum of company here,

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and we need to be very careful
and thoughtful about who we're

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.120 align:middle line:84%
doing business with, who
our alliances are with,

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.000 align:middle line:84%
who's best placed
to support humanity,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.540 align:middle line:84%
who's best placed to defend us,
who understands us the best.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I would like
to know a little bit more

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:52.130 align:middle line:84%
about who's representing
us in these conversations

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and in whose interests
decisions are being made.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I do think we need
very subtle conversations, very

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.960 align:middle line:84%
subtle diplomacy to ensure we
get the best possible outcome

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.550 align:middle line:90%
for the human race.

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much does
the Pentagon know, Paul?

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well, that is
the $64,000 question.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.520 align:middle line:84%
The Pentagon, of
course, is a community.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that David Grusch exposed

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:20.450 align:middle line:84%
with his complaint
is that you've got,

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:26.490 align:middle line:84%
or about 17 departments
not talking to each other.

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So in secret services,
there's a really strong policy

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of compartmentalization,
subsidiarity so

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.850 align:middle line:84%
that if this unit over
here makes this discovery,

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:41.600 align:middle line:84%
this unit over here won't
know anything about it.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the Pentagon
as a whole might not

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:49.230 align:middle line:90%
have that embrace of a picture.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And part of what David
Grusch was suggesting

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.470 align:middle line:84%
with his complaint
is that we really

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:56.960 align:middle line:84%
need a global
understanding of what's

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.080 align:middle line:84%
happening within
the Pentagon, and we

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.650 align:middle line:84%
do need to consider what's
the legality of keeping

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that information from our
elected representatives.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's take a look at
the cover of your new upcoming

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:11.570 align:middle line:90%
book.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: Well, "The
Invasion of Eden"

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.750 align:middle line:84%
really explores everything
we've been talking about.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:21.840 align:middle line:84%
My field is studying ancestral
narratives, Indigenous

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.400 align:middle line:90%
story from around the world.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And "The Invasion of Eden" asks,
if we listen to our ancestors--

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great
title, by the way.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Oh, thank you.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Did they have some wisdom to
offer us in the 21st century

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:39.120 align:middle line:84%
for how we take our steps
forward with the contact we have

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:39.970 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's a quite thick book.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So, obviously, the answer
is yes, our ancestors

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.710 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of wisdom that
we need to be tapping.

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When do you predict
we get our disclosure?

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: I think we're
going to see an acceleration

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.840 align:middle line:90%
in the next months and years.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.360 align:middle line:84%
There was a rapid
progress last year

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.640 align:middle line:84%
with how much information
was in the public domain.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.620 align:middle line:84%
But when you listen to
that hearing on July 26,

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.890 align:middle line:84%
we reached some moments
where David Grusch

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and the other witnesses
are asked a question

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and the answer is, I can answer
that in a closed session.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.430 align:middle line:84%
That would have to be
addressed in a SCIF.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Privately.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WALLIS: Privately.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And so an example
would be he's talking

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.660 align:middle line:84%
about non-human biologics,
does that mean people?

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.470 align:middle line:90%
He's talking about pilots.

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.653 align:middle line:90%
We have pilots.

00:46:38.653 --> 00:46:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
more nefarious?

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WALLIS: So pilots, does
that mean they're alive?

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean we're
in communication?

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would
have to be in a SCIF.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think some of the
information that was in a SCIF

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.830 align:middle line:84%
is going to become public
in the months ahead.

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to follow
the same formula as with the Tic

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:56.755 align:middle line:90%
Tac video.

00:46:56.755 --> 00:46:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I think what's
going to happen is

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.460 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
a semi-official leak

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.840 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.090 align:middle line:10%
The Pentagon will watch
for a couple of years

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.050 align:middle line:10%
to see how the public responds.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.380 align:middle line:10%
And then when there's
no panic, the Pentagon

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.790 align:middle line:10%
will say, yes, we
authenticate that.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:13.730 align:middle line:84%
