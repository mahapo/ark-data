00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome to a
new edition of Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.120 align:middle line:10%
Sarah Breskman Cosme
joining us again.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.870 align:middle line:10%
She's a bestselling author
and master hypnotist

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:10%
specializing in past life
regression and quantum healing

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:10%
hypnosis techniques.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.400 align:middle line:10%
She has recently
published her new book,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:10%
A Hypnotist Journey to Avalon.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:10%
Sarah, welcome to the program.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.607 align:middle line:84%
>>SARAH BRESKMAN COSME:
Thanks so much for having me

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:90%
again, George.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's new?

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, my gosh.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wanted to
tell you a secret.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.857 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that Dolores Cannon
had a secret crush on you?

00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She never told me that.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:90%
God rest her soul.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:90%
How did you hear that?

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Well, from her family.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:10%
And they knew I was coming on
here because I do her work,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:10%
so I'm close with her family.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:10%
And they said that it was
a secret that she had.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I first met her when
I was doing my Nighthawk show

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:10%
in Saint Louis many, many
years ago in the late 1990s.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And she
loved you very much.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.590 align:middle line:90%
I know you guys were buddies.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're going
to make me tear up.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about your new book,
A Hypnotist Journey to Avalon.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:90%
And what is Avalon?

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, my gosh.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:84%
This newest book
is so interesting.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So I do the same work
that Dolores did.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And essentially,
I take my clients

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.370 align:middle line:90%
to the deepest level of trance.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I find
out all this information,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and it's so fun.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So my newest book, A
Hypnotist Journey to Avalon,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:90%
happened by accident.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I essentially didn't know I
would be writing about Avalon.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And I had this client
named Christie that was

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:90%
my main subject for this book.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, how
this all started was

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Christie didn't know
about any of this stuff.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And she watched a
little video of me

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
talking to Regina Meredith about
this other woman named Christie.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And so this new Christie was
listening to this information

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and thought that
she knew me somehow.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And then she realized I was
talking about a different person

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
named Christie who had this
specific brain condition,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and the new Christie had
the same brain condition.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets even crazier.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:90%
So she's watching this show.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't know me, but
she thinks she knows me.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And she's hearing me talk
about this other Christie

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:90%
with the brain--

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thinking it's her.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
She just thinks, wow, this
is really interesting.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I start talking
about these things

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
that the new Christie has
had reoccurring dreams about.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So this new Christie
thinks, oh, my gosh.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
I need to contact this Sarah
person not knowing me at all.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And she tries to book
a session with me,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:90%
but I'm completely booked.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So then she sees I'm teaching
this workshop in the Keys

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and she thinks, I don't know
if I should go to a workshop

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
that I don't really
know anything about.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know this person.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So she thinks about going,
and she goes into her garden.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And as she's gardening, she
finds these two jugs sticking up

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:90%
out of the ground.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at
the jugs and she

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
realizes they're full of money,
so she starts to count them.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What?

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
They equal the amount
of my workshop.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:90%
So she books my workshop.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And then before coming
to the workshop,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:84%
since she has the
same brain condition

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:84%
as my previous hypnosis
subject for a previous book,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:84%
she contacts me to see if
she can get in earlier.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.192 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have anything
available I tell her.

00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're booked.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I'm totally booked.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And then the same
moment I respond to her,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.280 align:middle line:90%
somebody for that date cancels.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So I fit her in, and that's
how this book started.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:84%
She comes in for her
session, and she tells me

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.070 align:middle line:84%
this crazy story of how she
found the money in her garden.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And so, under hypnosis, she
recounts this amazing past life

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.020 align:middle line:84%
where her name was Alice and
she lived in the Middle Ages.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And Alice was connected to
this place called Avalon,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and that's how I started
into this whole world.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
Avalon was, and I'd never

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:90%
heard really about this place.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But according to my
clients, and according

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:84%
to Christie, this
new Christie, Avalon

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:90%
is almost like this realm.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Some people describe
it as a fairy realm,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and some people describe
it as a place in the UK.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
But what I've noticed
is that it's almost

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:90%
like a consciousness.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And why all this information
was coming to me right now

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
is that as we merge through this
evolution of our consciousness,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:84%
we're bumping up
against this realm.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, according to
the higher selves of my clients,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:84%
we need this information
so we can be aware

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of what we're bumping up
against and how we can actually

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:90%
access magic again.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And that was the whole point
that this client under hypnosis

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:84%
was bringing to my attention was
that we are magical creatures

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:90%
and we hold so many abilities.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And as we're moving
through this evolution,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:84%
we need to remember
these ancient ways

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
so we know how to
utilize this magic again.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it mythical
or a real place?

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: No.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like
according to these clients

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.063 align:middle line:90%
that it's a real place.

00:06:07.063 --> 00:06:07.863 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's go.

00:06:07.863 --> 00:06:08.988 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It's not mythical.

00:06:08.988 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes, let's go.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're bumping
up against this realm.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, in a sense, it
seems like people actually

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
have memories of being in
this realm, this fairy realm.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Or memories of actually doing
sacred ceremonies in this place

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.660 align:middle line:84%
that you would consider
Avalon in the United Kingdom.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And then there's even
an Avion in the cosmos.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing that when
you connect with this realm,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
that there are actually
amazing benefits

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.090 align:middle line:90%
that we can gain from it.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
You can work with
the Fairy Kingdom

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and you can receive a lot
of benefits from doing that.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
It seems like there are actually
fairies that are in this realm

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that people are called
to work with, again.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In Avalon?

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: In Avalon and even
all around us, that they

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:84%
come into this realm and
they can do work with humans.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And that right now
we're bridging this gap

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
to start becoming more
aware of these other realms

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and these other creatures
that actually are right here.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
population of Avalon?

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: It seems like there's
a population of these fairy

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
creatures that
basically consider

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
themselves to live in this
realm and outside the realm.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So these fairy creatures
that live in Avalon

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
or live in this realm that some
people consider to be Avalon,

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:90%
they are also here.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like
in this reality,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.470 align:middle line:84%
there are different
levels of realms that are

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:90%
stacked on top of this reality.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
When people are talking
about the different realms,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:84%
everything seems
to be right here.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So the creatures come in and
out of this realm, so to speak.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was Christie
physically in Avalon?

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So, Christie, my
client, was physically a human,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
but Alice was also physically
a human in the Middle Ages.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
But she was connected
to that other realm.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And what was so fascinating is
it seemed like her and her mom

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and her whole lineage
that came from Wales

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:84%
were actually reincarnations
of these light elves.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's so interesting.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
You hear a lot of people
talking about starseeds,

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's something I've
come across a lot in my work.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:84%
But now, people are starting
to realize that some people are

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:84%
reincarnations of these beings
that you would consider birth

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:90%
from the earth.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:90%
So they're more like--

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
when they talk
about their lineage,

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
it seems like they come
from these light elf

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
beings that also consider
themselves birth of Mother Gaia.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk to
these fairy creatures

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
or when they come through
my clients under hypnosis,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I've asked him if they
consider themselves

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to be extraterrestrial in
nature and they say no.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:84%
They consider themselves to
be children of the earth.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
That they feel like they
were birthed from the earth

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and they came through
the inner earth.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And that there is a
whole direct lineage

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.255 align:middle line:84%
of people and beings
from the earth,

00:09:41.255 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:84%
not extraterrestrials
in any way.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they
believe to be humans?

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
reincarnations

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
of these fairy creatures that
are human right now, actually.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What else does Christie
remember about the stone

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:90%
circles, for example?

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So it
was so interesting

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
because the stone circles
seem to be ancient transport

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
devices that were set up on
these specific ley lines, where

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
a person could go into
these stone circles.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
activated, you

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
could transport yourself
into a different realm,

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.770 align:middle line:84%
a different dimension, or a
different place on the earth.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And in a stone
circle, you could also

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:84%
reconnect with some of
your ancient ancestors.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:90%
You could do many ceremonies.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But Christie, in her
past life as Alice,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:84%
went into one of
these stone circles

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and ended up in that place
you would consider Avalon.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And in this place where she went
to through the stone circle,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
she actually reconnected with
a lot of her lineage there.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's amazing.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It seems like some of
these stone circles

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
can actually activate
during the equinox,

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:84%
or a lightning of the veil it
opens up like a new pathway.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could Avalon
have been Atlantis?

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: That's a
really good question,

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't seem like
Avalon was Atlantis.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a lot of my clients
that remember Atlantis

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:90%
remember that some of them--

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:84%
actually, some of the people
from Atlantis, actually

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:84%
went to Avalon to get away
from some of the Atlanteans.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Because during that
time period when Atlantis was

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.590 align:middle line:84%
going down, there
were some people--

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Literally.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.148 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yeah, and
there were some people

00:11:39.148 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
that were warned
that they needed

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.990 align:middle line:84%
to leave Atlantis and take with
them some sacred artifacts.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all these
great civilizations

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
have a sacred artifact
that is never destroyed,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:84%
and the same happened
with Atlantis.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Humanity has a lot of treasure
that came from Atlantis,

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and even before
that has never been

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.250 align:middle line:90%
destroyed like the holy grail.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And like some of these
books and scrolls, and even

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:84%
the use of monatomic gold
was a practice that people

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:90%
remember from Atlantis.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:23.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons why they
were working with monatomic gold

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
was because they understood
that monatomic gold could

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:84%
activate the Merkabah
within their bodies.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And they also realized that as
we move through this ascension

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:84%
process, the pyramids all around
our earth plane form a Merkabah.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain
point, it's prophesied

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that the Merkabah
within our bodies

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and the Merkabah
around this planet

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.580 align:middle line:84%
will light up and cause
a spinning motion.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And it will bump this whole
realm into a higher realm,

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's something
that was prophesied even

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.720 align:middle line:84%
before the destruction
of Atlantis.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.113 align:middle line:84%
In the higher selves that
have come through my clients,

00:13:11.113 --> 00:13:12.530 align:middle line:84%
they talk about
the fact that they

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:84%
knew that Atlantis would always
go down as part of the ascension

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Knights
Templars, Sarah,

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.300 align:middle line:84%
established hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of years

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
ago to protect Christians on
their passage to Jerusalem

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:90%
and then they expanded.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:36.930 align:middle line:84%
What's their connection to
Atlantis, the red crystals,

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.750 align:middle line:90%
and that region?

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So it was really
interesting in people's memories

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
because I'm researching
everyone's memories.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:49.340 align:middle line:84%
It seemed as if the Knights
Templar were at one point

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
guarding this one royal
family, but that royal family

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.850 align:middle line:84%
had this wizard that was helping
that particular royal family.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And this wizard
taught that family so

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:90%
many different ancient ways.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the shaman.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes, like a shaman.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And they also taught
the Knights Templar

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
some of these ancient ways,
and that trickled down

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:90%
into their society.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:84%
But in people's memories when
they remember the Knights

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Templar starting
all of this, they've

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
seen that some Templars
were actually people that

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:90%
were connected to the Essenes.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:84%
That they were
connected to this--

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As was Jesus.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.255 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
quite interesting

00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
to see that there has been a
group of people that were tasked

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:84%
with hiding and safeguarding
some of our artifacts

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and treasures for when the time
is right for all this knowledge

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.560 align:middle line:90%
to resurface.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.935 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the significance

00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:90%
of the red crystals?

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So the
red crystals seem

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:90%
to be some of this treasure.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:84%
In other societies or
extraterrestrial societies,

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
they understood how powerful
the red crystals were.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And the red crystals can
actually destroy and create

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.720 align:middle line:90%
a civilization.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.170 align:middle line:84%
In the Pleiadian
star systems, they

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.800 align:middle line:84%
would use the red crystals
to create another realm

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:90%
that they would pass into.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And it would download them with
the secrets of the universe,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and they would understand
that everything

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:90%
is set up like a game.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And that the whole
point of our evolution

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.120 align:middle line:84%
is to become lighter
in our density.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:90%
So everybody has this goal.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Every soul has a
goal where it wants

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
to lighten itself and continue
to move through these expansions

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and evolutions and
lighten their density.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
But these red crystals are
so incredibly powerful,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and some of them were
used in Atlantis.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:84%
They were brought
over from Atlantis

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.940 align:middle line:84%
before Atlantis went
down and they were--

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.520 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them were
hidden in Egypt.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And then some of
the Knights Templar

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:84%
were tasked with hiding
these powerful crystals,

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and they hid them as some of
the crown jewels in Scotland.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And then they took
them and they hid them

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:84%
on an island in Nova Scotia,
where according to my clients,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.690 align:middle line:84%
they're still buried
even to this day.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
But there is a prophesied
time when this will resurface

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and people will start to have
these red crystals again.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But it won't be
any time too soon,

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
because our consciousness has to
be ready for that type of power.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
your client, Janice,

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and what she remembers
about Avalon.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Janice was really
interesting because Janice--

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still a client?

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yes, Janice is a
fantastic hypnosis subject.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So Janice remembered
that they used

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.930 align:middle line:84%
the power of their own bodies,
because they understood

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:84%
the power of body in
relation to how they would

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.329 align:middle line:90%
create these sacred ceremonies.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So in some of
these ancient ways,

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
the women were the
natural leaders.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons why the
women were the natural leaders

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:90%
and the women--

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and they had a
matriarchal society

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of these
ancient cultures

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.260 align:middle line:84%
is because back
in the day, women

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:84%
would store in their
subconscious mind

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:40.990 align:middle line:84%
really important
information about plants.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't have
to teach their daughters.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle line:84%
It would just automatically
be like an instinct

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
that they would pass
to their daughter,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
or their daughter
would just know

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
what plants they
would use for what

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and what plants cause
hallucinogenic side effects

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.750 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But this knowledge
was so important

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that the women were the
leaders because of it.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And also they also understood
that the womb was a very

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:90%
powerful manifestation center.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
women that had already

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.830 align:middle line:84%
gone through menopause
in these societies

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
were the leaders as well,
because they had so much power

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that they could utilize
in their physical body

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:90%
that they could create things.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:90%
They were so extremely powerful.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And women also
understood and used

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.300 align:middle line:84%
the cycles of the
moon to actually make

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:90%
different tinctures.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was a really interesting.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
reasons why they understood

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:90%
the power of the physical body.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These women
of Avalon, do they

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:90%
work with ley lines and grids?

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: They did.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.360 align:middle line:84%
They understood that they could
perform ceremonies and send

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.270 align:middle line:84%
an intention into the
grid system of the earth,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and it would actually affect
the earth, affect them as well.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So the women of Avalon, and just
like all these other cultures,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:90%
would do these ceremonies.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ceremonies
that I found very interesting

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.390 align:middle line:84%
is they would place
their feet on the ground

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and they would do this
type of hip shaking.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And it was really--

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Elvis would
be impressed, right?

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I think so,
because it was amazing how

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:90%
they would use their own body.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.923 align:middle line:90%
And what they were doing was--

00:19:40.923 --> 00:19:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a belly dance?

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Almost, yeah.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because you have

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that culture that still does
that type of ancient dancing.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
Polynesian dances,

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're still doing
this hip shaking motion.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, what
they were doing was

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:84%
they were getting rid
of negative energy.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
helping the earth

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and helping themselves
as a collective.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intriguing.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about your client,
Megan, and her tie-in

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.470 align:middle line:90%
to the Knights Templar.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Megan was really
interesting because--

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you got
a whole handful of them.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I know.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.120 align:middle line:84%
It's so exciting
the work that I do.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, Megan, under hypnosis,
could remember in so many detail

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:84%
being someone that was trained
by the Knights Templar.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So Megan remembered,
and her name was Jules.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:10%
She was a man in this lifetime.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:10%
She was just a seaman.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:10%
He was a seaman, and at first
he was just transporting

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:10%
artifacts and goods.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And he spent most of his life,
his adult life on a ship.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:90%
And his crew were excellent.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But they were approached
by the Knights Templar

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.465 align:middle line:84%
one day when they were doing
their work at one of the ports.

00:21:03.465 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who many
have said might

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:90%
be from the bloodline of Jesus.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah, possibly.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was so interesting
because they approached them

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.890 align:middle line:84%
because they had
been watching them.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.990 align:middle line:84%
The Templars had
been watching them,

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and the Templars wanted them
to transport their goods

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and artifacts to hide them on
this island in Nova Scotia.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And so my client,
Megan, remembered

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.700 align:middle line:90%
transporting these artifacts.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, she could
remember so many details

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.490 align:middle line:84%
of this past life
and what it was

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
like to work with
the Knights Templar.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of the interesting things
that the Templars taught

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:84%
them was they taught
them how to really become

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:84%
more of a vessel
for the higher self.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.340 align:middle line:90%
I found that so fascinating.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle line:84%
They learned how to do these
breathing techniques, where they

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:84%
would breathe in
through their whole body

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and breathe all the way up
to their third eye and crown

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:06.510 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And when they would
release the breath,

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
it would bring them into this
really deep state of relaxation.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And it would help them
actually receive more messages.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they taught them how
to become like a transmitter

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:90%
for even more information.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So they were taught
to go outside and put

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.390 align:middle line:90%
their feet in the water.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And when the sun was going down
and the moon was hitting them

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, that
they would be downloaded

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of information.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were taught so
many different things like

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that that would help
them in their missions,

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:84%
guiding this treasure
because the treasure was

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:90%
so important to humanity.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So if they were to
receive messages

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:84%
from the cosmos that were also
helping them with this mission,

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.370 align:middle line:84%
then they would understand how
to open themselves in this way.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.910 align:middle line:84%
These were ancient techniques
that were taught to them.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:84%
They were also taught to wear
the equal arm, red cross.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't realize this,

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:84%
but that is a very
powerful symbol.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Some of these symbols
are so powerful that they

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:17.300 align:middle line:90%
hold a vibration, a song.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And the equal arm
red cross actually

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:84%
is said to hold the
vibration of source

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.440 align:middle line:90%
and it would protect people.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So the cross actually symbolized
the arm stretching out.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
It would be so stretching out
to basically support the person.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the bottom part of the
cross was the grounding element

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and the top part was
connected to the cosmos,

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and this symbol was a very
powerful protective symbol.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But under hypnosis,
didn't Megan also talk

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:90%
about the bloodline of Jesus?

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So apparently the Templars--
and this is controversial,

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:03.973 align:middle line:84%
but apparently the Templars
knew that Jesus had children.

00:24:03.973 --> 00:24:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what I hear.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: And apparently the--

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's Mary Magdalene.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I guess so.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And apparently they
kept a written record

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:15.933 align:middle line:84%
of where this bloodline went
because it had to be protected.

00:24:15.933 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we have
a clip of Megan talking

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:90%
about Jesus's bloodline.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:10%
- There is a
bloodline of Christ.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.470 align:middle line:10%
- Does that hold
magical properties?

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.380 align:middle line:10%
Is that the bloodline that
they were always searching for

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:10%
and they knew who was part
of the bloodline of Christ?

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:38.050 align:middle line:10%
- There are descendants of
Jesus in our world currently,

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.470 align:middle line:10%
and we know what a
strong soul He was.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:10%
And so that bloodline in His
DNA, it exists in this world.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.470 align:middle line:10%
And the Templars
know that actually.

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:10%
They're aware of who
those individuals are,

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.360 align:middle line:10%
and that is a
protected bloodline.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:10%
And so when we talk about
the cup of life, for example.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:10%
When the cup of life is found on
this island, which it will be,

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:10%
those descendants
of his bloodline

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:10%
are going to be able to go there
and light up that cup of life.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.500 align:middle line:10%
And they'll be able to
activate that so easily,

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:10%
because that comes
from a long history

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:10%
of His specific bloodline.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.580 align:middle line:90%

How did she know this, Sarah?

>>COSME: She's under
hypnosis right there,

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.560 align:middle line:84%
so she didn't know
this stuff consciously.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Megan was a
perfect hypnosis subject

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.535 align:middle line:84%
because she didn't really
have any conscious knowledge--

00:25:30.535 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%

a reincarnated being?

>>COSME: Yeah, so under-- she
came in for a session with me

to just heal herself.

She had a lot of
physical issues.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:84%
She didn't any of this
stuff consciously.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes the work that
I do so fascinating, because I

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.880 align:middle line:84%
feel like I can find out
anything when a person--

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you never know
what they're going to say.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And you know what's
so interesting

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
about this particular
bloodline of Christ

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and that it had to be
protected, is apparently--

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and it seems like the
Templars even know this.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.660 align:middle line:84%
That when this holy
grail is found,

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:84%
it could be activated by
someone with this bloodline.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:22.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just like so many of these
ancient artifacts that we have.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:84%
It takes the right person
with the right bloodline

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:27.640 align:middle line:90%
to be able to activate it.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But what's also
really interesting

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:34.410 align:middle line:84%
is that as we evolve
our consciousness

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and as we go through
this ascension process,

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:84%
it seems like even if you
had a past life as one

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:84%
of these characters, you
can contain within your soul

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:84%
a specific soul bloodline that
is being activated right now.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So a person that had a past
life as one of these characters,

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.380 align:middle line:84%
could also activate
this cup of life.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And this cup of life or what
they called the holy grail,

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a real thing
that they would pass around

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and it would activate
with the right bloodline

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.010 align:middle line:90%
and with the right group.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And it would show you the
secrets of the universe, which

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:84%
is that really what
you're doing here

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.090 align:middle line:84%
is working on your ascension
and expansion of your soul,

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:90%
and that you're eternal.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So you wouldn't find
everlasting life in this life.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.110 align:middle line:84%
You would just be aware and
downloaded with the information

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:36.840 align:middle line:84%
that you had everlasting
life on the other side.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
Christie say about fairies

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:90%
as part of the Avalon ritual?

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So Christie would
talk about fairies and how

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.630 align:middle line:84%
we can reconnect with
fairies and start

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.000 align:middle line:90%
working with them again.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:84%
In Christie's past
life as Alice,

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.340 align:middle line:84%
she was taught
even by her mother

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:84%
that something that was
very beneficial to do

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.230 align:middle line:84%
would be to connect
with the fairy kingdom

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.950 align:middle line:84%
by offering gifts that
they like, shiny objects.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And they like to work with
people that are full of joy.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:17.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why a lot of children
can see fairies, because--

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have a clip
of Christie's regression

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
that you did that talks about
the origins of the fairy people.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.280 align:middle line:10%
- Are the Fae extraterrestrial?

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:10%
- No, they are not.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:10%
- What are they?

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:10%
- They evolved and birthed
from the elements of the earth.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:42.510 align:middle line:10%
They are the children of
Arda or Gaia or earth.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:48.620 align:middle line:10%
So many names for her in
creation together with source.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:10%
And extraterrestrials
came here, and some even

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:58.760 align:middle line:10%
mated with the Fae.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.170 align:middle line:10%
But they are different.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:10%
Some live inside the earth,
some went into the earth

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:10%
after children from
the stars came.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.530 align:middle line:90%
And she knows this how?

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: She's just finding
this out like I am in real time.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was she
hypnotized there?

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: She's in
deep hypnosis there.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:90%
So this is how all this stuff--

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who was
she under hypnosis?

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Under hypnosis, she
was this woman named Alice

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:90%
who lived in the Middle Ages.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.230 align:middle line:90%
And she was actually--

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Alice was actually married
to King Edward I's nephew.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You found all this
out under interrogation?

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Uh-huh.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing
because I could find out

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.460 align:middle line:84%
all these details
about her life and what

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:84%
it was like to live as
a woman in the castle.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.770 align:middle line:90%
oh, my gosh.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
It was so-- George,
it was so fascinating.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the stuff there.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're
doing this, you

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:84%
must be in awe over
some of the things that

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.360 align:middle line:90%
comes out of their mouths.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I'm really
so grateful to Dolores

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:84%
because this is like
the funnest job ever.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I love all the stuff
that I get to find out,

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and then I get to
share it with you.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What other things did
they talk about Avalon about?

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, they
kept saying that there

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.350 align:middle line:84%
are children that are
being born these days that

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:34.310 align:middle line:84%
are bridging the gap between
the fairy realm and humanity.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the markers is that
they are coming in after 2013.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:46.920 align:middle line:84%
The number 13 seemed to be a
very powerful fairy number.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because I thought
that 13 was like a bad number,

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.500 align:middle line:84%
but it turns out that's
a very lucky number.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And even the druids knew
the power of the 13.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.080 align:middle line:84%
But one way to connect
with the fairies

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.850 align:middle line:84%
is just by showing
your respect to them,

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and leaving them little
offerings and gifts.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And asking for them to
work with you, because they

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.240 align:middle line:90%
can actually be very beneficial.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And they can be beneficial
with your plants

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and help you in many
different aspects of your life

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:24.690 align:middle line:84%
if you approach it in
a very respectful way.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been scared, Sarah?

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: No.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doing some kind
of hypnosis on somebody

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're hearing
what they're saying.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Did it ever frighten you?

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: No.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:35.840 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never?

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: The reason I
think it's so beneficial

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:46.490 align:middle line:84%
is I'm speaking with their
higher consciousness.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a higher level
looking down on our life,

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and I get to see things
from a higher perspective.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So for you and I right now,
looking around ourselves

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what's
going on, sometimes it

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:90%
doesn't always look great.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you take a step
back and you see things

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.880 align:middle line:84%
from a higher perspective,
you can find out anything.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.340 align:middle line:84%
You can find out why
you chose this lifetime,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and you can find out what
you're really doing here

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how
everything always works out.

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever
regress yourself?

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I try to get one
session a year, honestly.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like everybody
has so much information

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:90%
within them, and I try--

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.170 align:middle line:84%
it helps me in my life, so
I get one regression a year.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is this so
important to all of us?

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: The
importance to all of us

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.470 align:middle line:84%
is really that as we move
through our evolution,

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.870 align:middle line:84%
when people look
into the future,

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:56.950 align:middle line:84%
they see we return
to the ancient ways.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
important to understand

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.140 align:middle line:90%
what are the ancient ways.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.020 align:middle line:90%
How do we reclaim these?

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.560 align:middle line:84%
How do we become one
with nature again?

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And it seems on the other side,
or from a higher perspective,

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.890 align:middle line:84%
or if you look into
the future a little bit

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:84%
we live within
harmony of nature.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And we have
beautiful communities

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:31.650 align:middle line:84%
that look more tribal, and
so it's just very helpful

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we're
reclaiming our magic.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:84%
It's also important
to understand--

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to so many clients
under hypnosis and their higher

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.180 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to understand
that in the rest of the cosmos,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.910 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
being in the universe

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:58.120 align:middle line:84%
is the awakened human, the
fully developed, spiritually

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:02.210 align:middle line:84%
developed human like
Shiva or like Buddha.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Which means that everyone
is sitting on so much power

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.900 align:middle line:90%
and we just don't know it.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand how
to use our physical body,

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:15.830 align:middle line:90%
our emotional guidance system.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:16.929 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.710 align:middle line:90%
It's been programmed out of us.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's time to reprogram
ourselves to reclaim this,

00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:23.710 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people are
really developed that far?

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I'm not.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:29.889 align:middle line:90%
I wish.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I'm still
a work in progress.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.320 align:middle line:90%
One day at a time.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
as a collective,

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.750 align:middle line:84%
we're doing this
as a collective.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:46.739 align:middle line:84%
I think that just being
aware of the potential

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:50.670 align:middle line:84%
helps people to understand
the power that they

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:56.710 align:middle line:84%
have within them, and to go
start to investigate themselves.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you ever
like to visit Avalon?

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I would love to.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I would love to.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.662 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think you'd see?

00:35:02.662 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I think I would see
all the magical fairy creatures.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted
to see a dragon.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it would
be really amazing.

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Apparently, they're very wise.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And people actually make
connections with this realm,

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:90%
and they can receive guidance.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.030 align:middle line:90%
And what about you, George?

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.560 align:middle line:90%
What would you go see?

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to see
the women of Avalon.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Me too.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I want to do one
of those ceremonies

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.690 align:middle line:90%
because it sounds really cool.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's a lot
you could do when you understood

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:40.060 align:middle line:84%
how to manifest something,
or use crystals,

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:45.730 align:middle line:84%
or-- apparently in Avalon,
this sacred place in the UK

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.960 align:middle line:84%
that used to be
shrouded by mists,

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.027 align:middle line:90%
there's still treasure there.

00:35:50.027 --> 00:35:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's interesting.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:84%
We have the myth of the
Amazonian women in the Amazon,

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.340 align:middle line:90%
and then we have Avalon.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Are there any
similarities there?

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Probably.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the women understood
how to manifest things,

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and they understood the
sacredness of how connected

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.440 align:middle line:90%
they were with the earth.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And they understood
about plants and how

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:18.610 align:middle line:84%
to use the different
dances and things

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:22.280 align:middle line:90%
like that would be my guess.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But that's something
I hope I find out

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.557 align:middle line:84%
about in future sessions
about those women.

00:36:28.557 --> 00:36:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you'll let us know?

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Definitely.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarah,
the women of Avalon

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:36.840 align:middle line:84%
apparently had a meeting
with the Templars

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.120 align:middle line:90%
on some kind of island.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:90%
What was the island?

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Was that Avalon?

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: That's what some
people consider Avalon as well.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:48.580 align:middle line:90%
So it was shrouded in mist.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why they did
all their sacred ceremonies

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.360 align:middle line:84%
there was because
during this time period,

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.480 align:middle line:84%
if they were doing these
ceremonies in a forest,

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.310 align:middle line:84%
say, and someone came upon them,
they would have been murdered.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So they had access
to this island

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:14.890 align:middle line:84%
that would only be available
during certain tides.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And these women of Avalon
had foreseen in their visions

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:22.690 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars would
be working with them.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So one Templar in particular saw
one of these women in a town.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And the woman allowed the
Templar to follow her,

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they
started this relationship.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
At certain points, the
Templars would hide.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that a no, no?

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: No.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:84%
It was very-- it was a
beautiful relationship they had.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.400 align:middle line:84%
They had common goals,
which was basically

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
helping to store our sacred
artifacts and our treasure.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happened
to the relationship?

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: There was a beautiful
relationship between my clients

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:09.560 align:middle line:84%
under hypnosis, her teacher
and this one particular woman

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.710 align:middle line:90%
in Avalon.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:84%
They developed a very
romantic relationship.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.020 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like-- they
didn't have children.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:84%
It was just a very
beautiful relationship

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:24.320 align:middle line:84%
of divine masculine
and divine feminine.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because when

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.490 align:middle line:84%
people look into
the future, they

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:33.160 align:middle line:84%
see this template of
relationships resurfacing.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So it was so beautiful
in her descriptions

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.860 align:middle line:90%
of this type of relationship.

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is Jules Hernandez?

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Jules Hernandez
was the name of this person

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.680 align:middle line:90%
in that past life.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Because she could
remember everything

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.880 align:middle line:84%
when it came to that life,
so she remembered her name.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And she remembered, basically,
she was like a Spaniard.

00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:03.850 align:middle line:84%
She remembered even down to
what her fork looked like.

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:07.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the mess
hall, where they hid

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.240 align:middle line:90%
the treasure on this island.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was just fascinating to
understand all this information.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The holy
grail is the chalice

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.010 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus drank from, right?

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where is it?

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It's right now--

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.680 align:middle line:84%
when the Templars secured this
artifact in people's memories,

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.700 align:middle line:84%
it seemed like they secured
it from King Solomon.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And they put it
in a crate and it

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:84%
was transported to this
island, where it still

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:47.130 align:middle line:84%
is, in miles and miles deep
in Nova Scotia right now.

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.750 align:middle line:90%
This chalice was fascinating.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Because when people would
pass it around in a circle,

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:57.830 align:middle line:84%
what they remembered
is that they weren't

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:00.060 align:middle line:90%
drinking any liquid from it.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.000 align:middle line:84%
They were drinking of
each other's spirit,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.870 align:middle line:84%
and they would drink this in
and it would activate them.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It would create this
energetic activation,

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and only when the right
person was touching it.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But it would create this
energetic activation

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and it would download
knowledge to them.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And this holy grail
in people's memories

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.370 align:middle line:84%
doesn't seem like it
came from the earth,

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:30.380 align:middle line:84%
but it was passed through
our ancient civilizations.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when people try to find
the origin of it, they can't.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.380 align:middle line:90%
They can't find the origin.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So it has some
specific properties

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:84%
where it actually can melt
in front of your eyes,

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:45.220 align:middle line:84%
but it would seem to have been
made out of a type of gold.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's really thanks
to Avalon that we still

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.820 align:middle line:84%
have these treasures, or we
even have this knowledge.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Like thank goodness for
these women and the Templars

00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that worked with these women
to secure this information

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and store it before hiding it to
where it is now on this island.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
your client, Drew.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, my gosh.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.200 align:middle line:84%
This is another crazy
thing that happened

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.230 align:middle line:84%
to me while putting together
this book is Drew under--

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:20.320 align:middle line:84%
when he was under hypnosis,
this presence came into the room

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.860 align:middle line:90%
and said his name was Merlin.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The magician?

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:32.660 align:middle line:84%
He said that I wanted to talk
to him, which how would anyone

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.560 align:middle line:90%
know this?

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.220 align:middle line:84%
No one knew what
I was working on.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Drew says
he was Merlin?

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, under hypnosis
Merlin started talking to him.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Under hypnosis they all
started doing strange things.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So Merlin started
speaking through my client,

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Drew, and started telling
me amazing things about--

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, we have a clip of
Drew who remembers being Merlin,

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and here's what he says
about being invisible.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:41:59.840 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:10%
- If a person wanted
to become a master

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.476 align:middle line:10%
and figure out how to
make themselves invisible,

00:42:05.476 --> 00:42:09.930 align:middle line:10%
like what you showed the
kingdom during Arthur,

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.760 align:middle line:10%
how does a person go about that?

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.143 align:middle line:10%
If they wanted to practice that.

00:42:13.143 --> 00:42:14.810 align:middle line:10%
- So I would say that
if somebody wanted

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.227 align:middle line:10%
to make themselves
invisible, they

00:42:16.227 --> 00:42:18.950 align:middle line:10%
would concentrate on
their own personal energy

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:22.940 align:middle line:10%
field in relationship to
the world around them.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.090 align:middle line:10%
And then energetically
push themselves

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:30.220 align:middle line:10%
higher until they're outside
of the frequency of that realm,

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.860 align:middle line:10%
or kingdom, or dimension
is the word in his mind.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:38.630 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at the energy
that contains as a sphere,

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:43.210 align:middle line:10%
and then you feel the energy
of that sphere in relationship

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:48.130 align:middle line:10%
to the energy of the
world around you.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you push the
vibrational sphere of yourself

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:53.960 align:middle line:90%
higher.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.860 align:middle line:10%
So if you feel within
you that the energy is

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:04.850 align:middle line:10%
differentially higher,
more gaseous, less dense.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.210 align:middle line:10%
My apologies.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:08.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm working with the
vocabulary he has.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:12.520 align:middle line:10%
If you felt that
energetics around

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.600 align:middle line:10%
you and you moved it upwards.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.620 align:middle line:10%
You moved it higher.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:19.640 align:middle line:10%
You moved it into
higher feeling states.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.200 align:middle line:90%
States of higher intentionality.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.270 align:middle line:10%
And then you push
downwards upon that energy

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:32.640 align:middle line:10%
so that you're popping
upwards as if you're

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.460 align:middle line:10%
like a bubble floating
higher into a higher

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.030 align:middle line:10%
dimensional frequency.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:40.480 align:middle line:10%
And when you do that, when
you push yourself higher,

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.460 align:middle line:10%
you would become invisible
to the lower realm.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.940 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Merlin was one of my favorite
characters in King Arthur lore.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: He was amazing.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.855 align:middle line:84%
I learned so much from
this consciousness.

00:43:51.855 --> 00:43:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there he was.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I know, and
I learned so much.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:44:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was telling me
how he would put information

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:04.230 align:middle line:84%
into these symbols
and cast the symbol

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:90%
and create different things.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And he would work
with the fairy realm

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and work with the
natural environment

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.550 align:middle line:90%
to create different things.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Merlin also said he had an
agreement with the fairy realm

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:21.100 align:middle line:84%
in order to get the Excalibur
for King Arthur as an agreement.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.580 align:middle line:10%
It was amazing what I could
find out through this being.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.050 align:middle line:10%
But what I wanted
to tell you, George,

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:31.340 align:middle line:10%
that was so fascinating to
me, is that how he's talking.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Merlin's talking about how
we could become invisible.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:38.980 align:middle line:84%
But he was saying that
us as a collective, this

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.340 align:middle line:90%
is what we're doing.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:45.200 align:middle line:84%
We're actually popping ourselves
up into a different realm,

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's what it's going
to feel like as we ascend.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do people find you?

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:52.550 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: They can
go to my website,

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:54.080 align:middle line:10%
theholistichypnotist.com.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And your
book, A Hypnotist

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:58.760 align:middle line:10%
Journey to Avalon,
where do we get that?

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: You can
get it on Amazon,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and in this book
contains a spell that you

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.570 align:middle line:90%
can use to see fairies.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Under hypnosis,
can I get to Avalon?

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Sure.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Why not, George?

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.092 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on Beyond Belief.

00:45:12.092 --> 00:45:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Thank you.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I might do this
and come back and report

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:19.190 align:middle line:90%
on what Avalon is like to you.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:24.930 align:middle line:90%
