00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:10%
Mike Ricksecker with us,
an author, researcher,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:10%
and filmmaker.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:10%
Two of his books, "A
Walk in the Shadows"

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:10%
and "Alaska's
Mysterious Triangle,"

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:10%
are Amazon bestsellers.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And today, he is sharing the
research from his latest book,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:84%
the award-winning
"Travels Through Time."

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:90%
Mike, welcome to the program.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE RICKSECKER:
Thank you, George.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Always a pleasure coming back
here and speaking with you.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are one of
our favorites, my friend.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:90%
How have you been?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I've been pretty
well, keeping very busy.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But everything has
been wonderful.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about the new work.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.735 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, the new
work, "Travels Through Time,"

00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
this was a passion
project of mine.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:10%
I had always been
very, very interested

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:10%
in the idea of time
and time travel,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.543 align:middle line:10%
dating back to
when I was a child.

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you remember
the movie "Somewhere in Time"

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
with Christopher Reeve
and Jane Seymour.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Favorite of mine.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:10%
And just the idea
and concept that he

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:10%
could will his consciousness
back in time from 1980

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:10%
to 1912 just always
fascinated me.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And over the years,
throughout my research,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I started realizing that a
lot of the different phenomena

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
that I was researching
and writing about

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:84%
could very well be a
time-related incident.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.665 align:middle line:84%
And so I dove back into
these concepts about time.

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this
work came out of.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then he
looked at the dated coin,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:90%
and it brought him back.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: And it brought
him back, unfortunately.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
At its heart,
that's a love story.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But the time travel
aspect of it--

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.740 align:middle line:84%
it was written by
Richard Matheson.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:84%
He had done a lot of research
into the nature of time

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:90%
and how it works.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So his original novel
for that actually

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:84%
has a character, Richard,
going to the library

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and looking up some of these
real books that Matheson

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
had referenced for his research
into the novel and then

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:90%
the screenplay.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
time mean to you, Mike?

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER:
Yeah, time really--

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't exist.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a human
construct, something

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
that we have created to
help describe our reality.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a measuring stick, really.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:84%
We use it to help us
to plant the crops,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
know when to show up at
work at the right moment

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:84%
so our supervisors don't
get upset with us, when

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to get on the bus at the right
moment, these sorts of things.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:90%
But that's a human idea.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Time is all concurrent.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
It's all here right now--
past, present, and future--

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.933 align:middle line:84%
inside what we call
the fourth dimension.

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
We call it time,
but it's really--

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
dimensions are there?

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.085 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: There are up to
11 hyperspatial dimensions,

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:51.640 align:middle line:84%
according to our
theoretical physics.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 11?

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.528 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: 11, yeah.

00:02:53.528 --> 00:02:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Those are a lot.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.403 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: It is.

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And those that are beyond
ours, fifth, sixth, seventh,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and onward, they would be
able to access our dimension

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
as a whole, just the same
way that we from the fourth

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.550 align:middle line:84%
are able to access a third,
second, first dimension.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do those
dimensions relate to time?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: They are really
outside the scope of time

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:84%
because time is our
fourth dimension.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So to them, it's all
an object that they

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
would be able to move
in and about at will.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
stacked time theory?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: So
stacked time theory,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.080 align:middle line:84%
when we take this concept
that all time is concurrent,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
so all ever present, take where
you're sitting right now, that

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:84%
would mean that every moment
that has happened is happening

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and will happen are all
happening right now.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:90%
It's all here.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And I relate each
of those moments

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
as a photograph in a
stack, a very large stack,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning of time
until the end of time.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And on occasion-- I
know we'll probably

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
get into it during the
conversation-- there

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
are two of those
moments that resonate

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.200 align:middle line:84%
the same frequency
for just a moment

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
because everything is frequency,
resonance, energy, vibration.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get a glimpse
of a moment in time,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:90%
another moment in time.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
would call a time slip.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are time
slips dangerous?

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Can you get lost in them?

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: A time
slip is really--

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like a
vision of another moment

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:90%
in time or a short experience.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.410 align:middle line:90%
They don't last for very long.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Those, I would say, you
couldn't really get lost in.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I would say things where
you would get lost in

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:84%
are portals and things like
this, which could take you

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.485 align:middle line:90%
to another point in time.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would time
look like to someone who's

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:90%
outside the dimension of time?

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.303 align:middle line:84%
This is where we're talking
about everything would

00:04:43.303 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:90%
look like an entire object.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So one way to look at some
of these different types

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.020 align:middle line:90%
of concepts is--

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
or take a town that you
might be driving through.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the speed limit
is 35 miles per hours.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe 5 miles
long down the road.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:84%
You've got a couple of
houses, a gas station, church,

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:90%
these sorts of things.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it takes
you 5 or 10 minutes

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:90%
to drive through that town.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So you have a relationship,
a time relationship,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:90%
with that town.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's say instead
you're flying over that town.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:90%
You look out the window.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see all
of it all at once--

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:84%
the houses, the gas
station, the church.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It is all right
there as a whole.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So what once had a
relationship in time,

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:84%
you now have a
relationship with in space.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we're talking
about when you are looking

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
at the fourth dimension from
these others, all time is there.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You made an amazing
trailer for your new book,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:90%
"Travels Through Time."

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.134 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:90%
- What is time?

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:84%
How do we define this
elusive thing we call time?

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
We've generally been taught that
time is like a river, flowing

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.690 align:middle line:90%
endlessly in one direction.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:84%
We are caught up in its current
and can only proceed downstream

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:90%
within its rushing waters.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:84%
This river of time
that we're stuck in,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
however, flows as a river
not because of the water

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
but because of the banks that
are holding the water in place.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.540 align:middle line:84%
If we were to
remove those banks,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
time would spill out
in all directions,

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:84%
flooding the plains until
it came to a standstill

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and was simply
just ever present.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:84%
We would no longer be
rushing downstream with it,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
but would be able to easily
wade through those waters

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.490 align:middle line:90%
to any point we'd wish.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:84%
What those banks are
and what the mechanism

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:84%
is that's holding them
in place, we don't know.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:90%
But they control the flow.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Although this is a nice
analogy, and perhaps it

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:84%
gets the reader
thinking a little,

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't generally regard
time as a river at all.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Time doesn't really
exist after all.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Time is merely a human construct
to describe our reality

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and to bring some order to
this world in which we live.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
What we describe
as time helps us

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to differentiate the seasonal
changes of our planet,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:84%
to help us know when it's
appropriate to plant and harvest

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:84%
crops, and to help us get to
the office at the right moment

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
so we don't upset our
supervisors at work.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:84%
The river of time, however,
doesn't really exist.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just an idea
we've put forth

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:84%
to keep track of our
experience in what

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:90%
is really the fourth dimension.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:84%
There are many who
believe that all time--

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:90%
past, present, and future--

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
are all happening
concurrently, each moment

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:84%
resonating at a
different frequency.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Just weeks before
his death in 1955,

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:84%
the famed theoretical physicist
Albert Einstein wrote, quote,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:84%
"the distinction
between past, present,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and future is only a stubbornly
persistent illusion," unquote.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of
years, ancient cultures

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
discussed the illusionary
nature of this world

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and that the universe as we
know it is not as it seems.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.740 align:middle line:84%
There are other dimensions
and planes of existence

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that surround us, which we
don't usually experience

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:90%
with our limited human senses.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Some of these were able to
measure with instrumentation,

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
such as different wavelengths
of light and sound.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.438 align:middle line:90%
Others were still discovering.

00:08:15.438 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:10%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.097 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good job, Mike.

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Thank you, George.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.198 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's going
to be a bestseller.

00:08:22.198 --> 00:08:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: It's done
pretty well so far.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.972 align:middle line:84%
What makes you
write books on time?

00:08:28.972 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
again, this was

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:84%
a passion that goes all the
way back to when I was a child

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
and I had seen how the
different other subjects that I

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
was researching,
whether that was

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
the Alaska Triangle,
or shadow entities,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
or some of these stargates that
we had talked about before,

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:84%
that they had this time-related
component to it that could be

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:84%
a type of real time
travel as we're

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.590 align:middle line:84%
moving in and about
these other dimensions.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got a picture
of the "Papyrus of Ani."

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I want you to explain
to us what this is.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah,
the "Papyrus of Ani."

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- when we look
at ancient cultures and try

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
they thought of time,

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
in this particular
reference here--

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.230 align:middle line:84%
this is one of the most
beautiful representations

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:84%
of what we call the "Book
of the Dead" that exists.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And here throughout the
entire narrative, Ani,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:84%
who was a scribe
in ancient Egypt,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
he's actually dead
throughout this entire thing.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
This may have even been
written by his own hand.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.990 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure of that,
or it may have been

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.937 align:middle line:90%
written by scribes afterwards.

00:09:39.937 --> 00:09:41.270 align:middle line:90%
He may have had it commissioned.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:10%
But throughout this
narrative, he's

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:10%
going through his afterlife
journey with his wife, Tutu.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:10%
And he gets to this
particular point

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.570 align:middle line:10%
where he's talking with one of
the creator gods known as Atem.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And what he asks Atem is, what
would be the span of my life?

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Which is a really
interesting question

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:90%
because, again, Ani is dead.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Why would he be asking
about the span of his life?

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And Atem, then,
responds by saying

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.040 align:middle line:84%
that it will be for millions
and millions and years

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
on top of millions
and millions of years.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So he gives us this
idea of layering,

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.398 align:middle line:84%
like we were talking about
with stack time theory.

00:10:19.398 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
We have another
picture I want you

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:84%
to explain to us, an ancient
symbol of the ouroboros?

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: The ouroboros,
yes, the ouroboros.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is really our
first alchemical symbol.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the more
famous representations of it

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:84%
by Theodoros Pelecanos
where we first actually see

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.840 align:middle line:84%
this is on the burial shrine of
King Tut, which is fascinating.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And actually in the
"Papyrus of Ani,"

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
which we were just
talking about,

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Atem starts talking about
the rebirth of the universe

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and talks about himself, Atem,
taking the form of a serpent.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's that idea of
constant recycle and renewal,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.030 align:middle line:90%
which is what we see here.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the representation
of recycle and renewal

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:84%
of a person, their life, of the
Earth, and also of the universe.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But we have the idea of
duality in here as well.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
You have the two colors, so
duality, the hermetic principle

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:90%
as above, so below.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And where I believe
this comes into play,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.570 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about recycling
and renewal of the universe,

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:84%
when we see the snake
eating its own tail there,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:84%
you have really two different
sides coming together,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:90%
working in opposite directions.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.370 align:middle line:10%
And when they meet there,
it's the alpha and the omega,

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:10%
the beginning and the
end happening at once,

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:10%
which to me is the Big Bang.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.857 align:middle line:84%
So when we have that question
of what was before the universe,

00:11:51.857 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:90%
it was the universe.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:84%
What's coming after the
universe, the universe.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the ancients
knew that and had that

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.532 align:middle line:90%
embedded in their symbolism.

00:11:58.532 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
some who believe we're

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:90%
living in a simulated universe.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: I believe we are.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: I do.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it's a computer.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:90%
We--

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's not some kid
in a video game playing

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:90%
around the universe?

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I mean, that's a
fantastic representation of what

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:90%
a simulation is.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And we can use that as an
analogy to talk about this.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But I don't really
believe it's a computer.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's a technology
we don't quite understand.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.522 align:middle line:90%
It's probably more organic or--

00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who created it?

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I do believe in a
creator, or a creator or creator

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
beings that created this entire
simulation, this entire universe

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.980 align:middle line:90%
that we are in right now.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And our ancient religions
talked about this,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:84%
although they didn't use
the word "simulation."

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:84%
You look at the idea
of reincarnation,

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
where you're basically
coming from a homeworld,

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.560 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better term.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:90%
You come down here.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.720 align:middle line:90%
You learn some lessons.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you pass away,
basically you go back.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Even Christianity talks
about being in this world

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
right now to prepare
for the next world.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't use
the word "simulation."

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's that same
idea and concept.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
a time slip, Mike?

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.488 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: So
a time slip, when

00:13:17.488 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
we were talking before about
stack time theory, and two

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.630 align:middle line:84%
of those moments resonating
at the same frequency,

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.375 align:middle line:84%
I believe that each
of those moments--

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:84%
again, when we
talk about energy,

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:84%
frequency, resonance,
vibration, each of those moments

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:84%
in that stack has a
specific frequency.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes two
of those frequencies

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:84%
will match up with
each other, and we

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
will get a glimpse of
another moment in time,

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and we will be able
to interact with it.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And time slips, of
course, do they pop up at will?

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: They do seem
to be quite random sometimes.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there are
different components, perhaps

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:84%
within the land,
perhaps within--

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's elements
of a building that

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:84%
could help aid in the
energetic principles

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.980 align:middle line:84%
behind creating that time
slip to occur more often.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
But if we were able to
understand that fully and be

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:84%
able to harness
it, then I believe

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
that would help us
in real time travel.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important
is time-related incidents

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.620 align:middle line:90%
to the scheme of things?

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well, I
believe that for one,

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:84%
we're all trapped in what
we call this river of time,

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:90%
in that example with--

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're in it together.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: We're
in it together.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:84%
In that example, in
the book trailer,

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.950 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the
banks of the river

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:84%
helping time to flow,
time being the water.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And you were to
remove those banks.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, the banks of the
river, in that analogy,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:90%
they are the control mechanism.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So again, when we talked
about a simulated universe

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's some
sort of rule set

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:84%
that is placed
upon our universe,

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:84%
those banks of the river
keeping the time flowing.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:84%
That's part of that
rule set that's

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:90%
embedded within the simulation.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.788 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are ghosts and
hauntings all part of the same?

00:15:04.788 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Ghosts
and hauntings, I

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:84%
believe some of them, not all,
but many of them are time slips.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're not
understanding exactly what

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:90%
that is when it occurs.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I do believe some ghosts
to be human spirits.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:90%
We are multi-dimensional beings.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness, which is
that on the fourth dimension

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.110 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking
about, is embedded

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:90%
in a three-dimensional body.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
But when that body passes away--
the three-dimensional body is no

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:90%
more--

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness on
the fourth dimension

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
is still there
and, of course, can

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:84%
rise up into the
other dimensions

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.170 align:middle line:84%
or beyond, perhaps
the source, if we

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
talk about heaven
or the homeworld

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:90%
or those sorts of things.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.770 align:middle line:84%
All that said, some of these
ghosts and hauntings that we

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.500 align:middle line:84%
experience are some of
these time slips as well.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the horror
movie "The Conjuring"

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
was based on Andrea Perron's
childhood home and experiences.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.950 align:middle line:84%
However, in your
docuseries, the incredible--

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.370 align:middle line:84%
"The Shadow Dimension," she
shares that it was actually

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:84%
a time slip that was the most
remarkable thing that happened

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.180 align:middle line:90%
at that special house.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:14.290 align:middle line:84%
- She came out of her room
and she said she was hungry.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:90%
And my mother was wasting away.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:84%
She was living on
coffee and cigarettes.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:84%
She was waif-like
in her appearance.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:90%
And it was late.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
It was about probably
10:30 at night.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I had made beef stew for
my sisters that night

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:84%
and had helped them get their
homework done and gotten them

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:90%
off to bed.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I sat
quietly in the parlor

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and fed the fire because it
was October and it was cold.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
doing my homework.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me
if I would kindly

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:52.330 align:middle line:84%
warm her up a bowl of beef stew
and make a short pot of coffee

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:90%
for her.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And I walked through.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:90%
And I had to walk all the way.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:90%
You know how big that house is.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
I had to walk all the way
from the parlor to the kitchen

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:05.530 align:middle line:84%
to the pantry to warm
up some stew for mom.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
took a few minutes

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.210 align:middle line:84%
because microwaves
hadn't been invented yet,

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:84%
and we still used a
Farberware coffee pot.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:15.339 align:middle line:90%
So it took a few minutes.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And in my absence,
my mom leaned over

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.849 align:middle line:84%
to throw a big log
on the fireplace.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:84%
And when she did, she heard
laughter and conversation

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:90%
over her shoulder.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And she turned around
and she looked awestruck

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:90%
into the dining room.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And there, sitting at a
table that was not our own,

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:90%
was a family.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And there were a couple of
kids running around and being

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:90%
very playful and mischievous.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And there was a woman who was
dressed in a full-length dress

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.330 align:middle line:90%
or skirt and top.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And she was cooking stew over
a fireplace that was raging.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And that fireplace had been
closed and sealed tight

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.050 align:middle line:84%
for close to 100 years
before we even got there.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And there were two men sitting
at the table and one of them

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:84%
had a hat on and the other
was just sitting there.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:84%
They had pewter steins
in front of them,

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
which were outlawed
by the 1800s.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's indicative of the 1700s.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
chatting and having dinner.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And the mother told the kids to
take their places on the benches

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:90%
on one side of the table.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And the two men were sitting
on the other side of the table.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, one of them turned
and looked at the hearthstone

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:90%
of the fireplace in the parlor.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And he made direct eye
contact with my mother.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:90%
And he smiled.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And then he nudged the man
beside him and pointed at her.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And she was the ghost to them.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
my mother realized--

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
after years of
suffering in that house

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and not being able to make any
sense, to reconcile in any way

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:84%
the inexplicable events which
occurred there, suddenly she

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:84%
realized that she was in their
dimension at the same time

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:84%
that they were in her
dimension and that they

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:90%
could see each other.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking
into the future

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:84%
while she was simultaneously
peering into the past.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is for me and for
her, the most remarkable thing

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:90%
that ever happened at the farm.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very descript, Mike.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.335 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, that's
actually from my "Shadow

00:19:37.335 --> 00:19:38.285 align:middle line:90%
Dimension" docuseries.

00:19:38.285 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Andrea is a really
good friend of mine.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:90%
And I've been to that house.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating
that I found about

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that building is
underneath that parlor

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.640 align:middle line:84%
that she was talking
about there is

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:84%
what they call the well
room in the basement.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's called that because
there is an open well with water

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:90%
that is still there.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And the walls of that room
are made of limestone,

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and they're capped
with granite blocks.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is a type
of construction--

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
although in a much,
much smaller scale--

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.338 align:middle line:84%
a type of construction that
we see in ancient Egypt

00:20:11.338 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:84%
in some of these
locations where they

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:84%
were powering their temples, and
stargates, and things like this.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
tune into timeliness

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and like a radio tunes
into a frequency?

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:90%
How do you tune into that?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, so we've
been talking about energy,

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.330 align:middle line:84%
frequency, resonance,
vibration this whole time.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that to tune
into these other moments,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:84%
it is a matter of
tuning the consciousness

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:90%
into these other moments.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Whether that was last week,
last year, hundreds years ago,

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:84%
it's a matter of trying
to send that consciousness

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and will that consciousness
into those other moments.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it
doesn't come off

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:84%
as completely
clear when we talk,

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:84%
like some of these different
time slip incidents.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:84%
There was a fascinating
story that was

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.940 align:middle line:90%
related to me a few years ago.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
It regarded a young man
who was telling his story.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And when he was
a small child, he

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.280 align:middle line:84%
had walked into
his kitchen one day

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and saw a tall, dark, hooded
figure over by the kitchen

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.180 align:middle line:90%
table, scared him to death.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:90%
And he ran out of the room.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So this became the hooded shadow
figure story of the household

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, he grows up.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:90%
He's a young man.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And he's in the kitchen one day
making a sandwich at the kitchen

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:90%
table.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
He's wearing a hoodie
and all of a sudden,

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.860 align:middle line:84%
he sees this short,
small shadow being

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
come into the kitchen,
stop, and then dart

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:90%
right back out of the room.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And it dawns on
him, wait a minute.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.307 align:middle line:84%
It was myself that I
saw the whole time.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The doppelganger.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It's what I call the
doppelganger effect.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But it really wasn't
a doppelganger.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:84%
It was just himself at two
different moments in time.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And it came off as a shadow
because it wasn't fully tuned

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So we remember the old-school
radios where you had the dial.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
These days you can click
through the stations.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.497 align:middle line:84%
Back then, you had to
get that band perfect.

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're a little bit
before, a little bit after,

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:90%
it'd come in fuzzy.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think the same
thing here where

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.603 align:middle line:84%
his consciousness, his energy
trying to tune into himself

00:22:23.603 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:84%
at two different moments in
time, it was a little bit off,

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and it came off instead as a
shadow instead of fully formed.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly
is a doppelganger, Mike?

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: So a
doppelganger is--

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
it's a German word that
means "double walker."

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of legends
and lore behind these things,

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:84%
like evil twins
or spirits trying

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:84%
to mimic somebody else,
these sorts of things.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But I think that was
people not understanding

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.558 align:middle line:84%
what it was that they
were dealing with,

00:22:51.558 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
especially hundreds of
years ago when there

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.700 align:middle line:90%
was a lot of religious fear.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:84%
If it wasn't of God, then it
must have been of the devil.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And so they put a lot of these
evil connotations behind it.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.560 align:middle line:84%
But I think they
just simply weren't

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.540 align:middle line:84%
understanding some of these
time-related incidents.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the Mandela effect?

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: So
the Mandela effect--

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and this is really, really
interesting phenomenon

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:84%
these days where people
are remembering things

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
that happened in the past
that when you look them up

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't exist or
are changed today.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.430 align:middle line:90%
I believe it has--

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.970 align:middle line:84%
it's an effect of time
travel of people having

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.300 align:middle line:90%
modified something in the past.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:10%
Now, a lot of these reports
are of commercial branding

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.385 align:middle line:10%
and things like this, like the
spelling of Oscar Meyer or Fruit

00:23:40.385 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Loops and things like that.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.510 align:middle line:10%
I don't think anybody's
going back into the past

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:10%
to change branding.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:90%
That would be really trivial.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:84%
But if you do go back into the
past and even if it's just from

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:56.510 align:middle line:84%
a goal of observation-- you
just want to go back and watch--

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
your presence there will have
an effect on the environment.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And those ripples
will spread out

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and can have an effect
on our present today.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Parallel
universes, do they exist?

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: I believe so.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's some fascinating
research coming out

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
of Antarctica in a
peer-reviewed published paper,

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
where they've been doing
neutrino research down there,

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.500 align:middle line:84%
the ANITA project and
the IceCube project.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And now neutrinos are
supposed to come from space.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:33.890 align:middle line:84%
They're very small
particles and gives us

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.640 align:middle line:90%
information about the universe.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they had
recently released

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:42.750 align:middle line:84%
basically an illustration of our
solar system based on neutrinos.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.762 align:middle line:84%
While they were doing
this research down there,

00:24:44.762 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:84%
they also discovered
neutrinos that

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.088 align:middle line:84%
were coming up out of the
ground without source, which

00:24:49.088 --> 00:24:50.255 align:middle line:90%
was totally bizarre to them.

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:51.297 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just popping up.

00:24:51.297 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Just popping up.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the scientists
researched this as well.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And their conclusions--
and this was

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:84%
in a peer-reviewed
published paper.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Their conclusions
were that this was

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
indicative of a parallel
universe running

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:90%
in reverse time.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is reverse time?

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: So time
running backwards.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we were looking
at the ouroboros earlier,

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:15.928 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
we were seeing,

00:25:15.928 --> 00:25:18.130 align:middle line:84%
those two different
colored tracks.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.140 align:middle line:84%
The one is running
in one direction,

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:90%
and one is running in the other.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit
bizarre to think of.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But if we are
having interactions

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
with other moments
in time, it could

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:84%
be that some of
these time slips may

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
be of this other parallel
universe that we're witnessing.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And that could be why
it's an image of the past

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeing.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's modern times
for that other universe.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.250 align:middle line:84%
But for us it seems
like the past.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are
stargates and portals

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.190 align:middle line:90%
other points in reverse time?

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: So
stargates and portals,

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.090 align:middle line:84%
these can give us
access to, sure,

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:84%
other places in the
cosmos, maybe even

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.330 align:middle line:84%
other places on Earth,
other dimensions.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.320 align:middle line:84%
But it could also give us
access to other moments in time.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So we could pass through one
of these stargates and portals

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and find ourselves at
another moment in time.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:13.325 align:middle line:84%
And when we've talked before
about the Alaska Triangle,

00:26:13.325 --> 00:26:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and we've talked about some
of the missing airplanes that

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:84%
may be passed through some
sort of portal somewhere,

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.640 align:middle line:84%
they could have gone
back into the past

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:90%
through one of these portals.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mike, do portals and
stargates lead time travelers

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:90%
to other points in time?

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Well,
it very well could be.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Stargates and portals can do
a number of different things

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.380 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.797 align:middle line:84%
They could take
us to other places

00:26:34.797 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos, other places
on Earth, other dimensions.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they could take
us to other points in time.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:84%
When we've talked before about
the Alaska Triangle, some

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:84%
of these missing airplanes,
we have believed have actually

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.995 align:middle line:90%
passed through portals to--

00:26:47.995 --> 00:26:48.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof.

00:26:48.795 --> 00:26:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, just
poof, and never found again.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.692 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ideas
is they have passed

00:26:53.692 --> 00:26:54.900 align:middle line:90%
through one of these portals.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.235 align:middle line:84%
But we have to ask
ourselves, where did they go?

00:26:58.235 --> 00:26:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Did they go to
another dimension?

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Did they go to
another point in time?

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they went to
another point in time--

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
we'll throw an arbitrary number
out there, like 500 years ago--

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.770 align:middle line:84%
what would that look like
to the Indigenous peoples

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.337 align:middle line:90%
of the area 500 years ago?

00:27:11.337 --> 00:27:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good point.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:14.503 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: They would have
no concept of an airplane.

00:27:14.503 --> 00:27:17.860 align:middle line:84%
To them, it would be a loud,
thunderous bird in the area--

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:90%
in the air.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Is this where some of our
Thunderbird legends come from?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went and looked
at some spiral petroglyphs that

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.890 align:middle line:84%
represent stargates and
are a symbol of sky people

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:90%
traveling to Earth.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.140 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:84%
- So back behind me-- these
are the important petroglyphs.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the petroglyph trail,
but number 11 here on the trail

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
is where we get the spirals and
the stories of the star people.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to
ancient legend,

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.210 align:middle line:84%
these people from the stars
came down and gave knowledge

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:90%
to the peoples here.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Again, the site is
astronomically aligned.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:84%
The spirals are supposed
to represent the portals

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:01.950 align:middle line:84%
from which they traveled
from to get to here.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And we see stories like
this all over the world.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Here we are in the American
southwest, similar type

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.850 align:middle line:90%
of story--

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:12.280 align:middle line:84%
star people, spirals,
passing on knowledge.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.580 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very interesting that
we find the same exact thing

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.810 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:84%
- What I'm sure about that so
many of the caves and so many

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:27.000 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient drawings,
they made these spiral lines.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.906 align:middle line:84%
- You see the spirals
all over the world.

00:28:28.906 --> 00:28:29.706 align:middle line:90%
- Right?

00:28:29.706 --> 00:28:30.506 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:28:30.506 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
This is very interesting to
me here at the Nubian Museum.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So we see some of the artwork
here depicting spirals.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, you see these spirals
all over the world.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:44.860 align:middle line:90%
There's another one.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:49.630 align:middle line:84%
That's on an egg, could be the
cosmic egg with the spiral.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And you see these spirals
all over the world

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.990 align:middle line:90%
at Newgrange, Sardinia.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I was out in Chaco Canyon
a year and a half ago,

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and you saw the spirals
there and the petroglyphs

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:90%
with the star people.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people believe
that these spirals represent

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:84%
portals, and
gateways, and access

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:84%
points into other parts
of the universe that

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:84%
allow you to access other
dimensions that there's

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.770 align:middle line:90%
an energy to these.

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Are they recounting
a lost technology

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that became forgotten over
time, but at least somebody

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.930 align:middle line:84%
remembered here for at
least a brief moment.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:31.730 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:33.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a
fascinating aspect.

00:29:33.675 --> 00:29:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: It really is.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So the first part of that clip
was Chaco Canyon in New Mexico.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And the last part was there, the
Nubian museum in Aswan in Egypt.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Exact same symbolism, two
different parts of the world.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of laugh
when people say,

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.590 align:middle line:84%
well, isn't this
representative of water?

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.940 align:middle line:84%
The representation of
water in the ancient world

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:84%
was actually wavy lines,
representing ripples and waves,

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And you actually have
the Indigenous peoples

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.730 align:middle line:84%
of the area saying
these are portals.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So why wouldn't we
believe the people

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:84%
that actually created
this symbolism, that these

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.320 align:middle line:90%
are indicative of portals?

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are ETs time travelers?

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I believe
some of our accounts of ETs

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.390 align:middle line:90%
are time travelers.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of
been, let's say, kind

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:84%
of a wave of ideas
coming out lately

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.780 align:middle line:84%
in this area where some people
are saying that what we're

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.790 align:middle line:84%
seeing in the sky when
it comes to UFOs, UAPs,

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.650 align:middle line:84%
these sorts of things, they're
just us from the future.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.160 align:middle line:84%
They're not actually
extraterrestrials.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe we're kind
of getting ahead of ourselves

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I do believe some
of our UFOs, UAPs

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.410 align:middle line:84%
are extraterrestrials
from another planet

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos that have figured
out some sort of technology

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.250 align:middle line:84%
to be able to come
here with their craft.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe some are
interdimensional in nature.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I do believe some are
time travelers from the future.

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.410 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
have to be us.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:00.490 align:middle line:90%
They could be human.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But humans have only been around
on this planet for a very short

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.730 align:middle line:90%
period of time.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.350 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is 4.5
billion years old.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And we have about
another 5 billion years

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.360 align:middle line:84%
to go before it's
annihilated by the sun.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So it could very well be that
millions and millions of years

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.030 align:middle line:84%
from now another
intelligent life form

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.490 align:middle line:84%
evolves and develops
civilization and technology.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of that could be
time travel technology.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we could be observing
something Indigenous to Earth,

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.040 align:middle line:90%
but not necessarily us.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do interdimensional
beings or ETs

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to remove
us from the river of time?

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I believe when
we start talking about some

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
of these UFO abduction cases
and the time-loss incidents that

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.330 align:middle line:90%
people have in these cases--

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:51.060 align:middle line:84%
you look at the Barney and
Betty Hill case, Travis Walton.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But you can relate these even
to some of our ancient lore

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.200 align:middle line:84%
about fairies, how people were
taken into the fairy realm

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and experienced these
time-loss incidents.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So when you remove
somebody from, again,

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.920 align:middle line:84%
the fourth dimension
that we are calling time

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and you take them into
fifth, sixth, seventh,

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.310 align:middle line:84%
some other dimension,
that could be a dimension

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:19.970 align:middle line:84%
that is present there on the
mothership, if it's a UFO,

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:84%
or if they just take us off
into some other world or realm

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.610 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.740 align:middle line:84%
If it's in another
dimensional plane,

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:84%
time is going to work
differently there outside

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:32.430 align:middle line:90%
of the fourth dimension.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So five minutes
there, five days there

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.430 align:middle line:84%
could be very, very
different and actually would

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.603 align:middle line:84%
be very different than here
on our plane of existence.

00:32:40.603 --> 00:32:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
stories of time

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:46.010 align:middle line:90%
traveling entities in the past?

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: You do have
some of these accounts

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:90%
of time travelers in the past.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And they come in the
form of legends and lore.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:57.880 align:middle line:84%
They've kind of been
depicted as fairy tales,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.170 align:middle line:90%
these sorts of things.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are grains of
truth within these tales

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:84%
that we have to look at and
give some credence to that

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.610 align:middle line:84%
beyond the legendary
aspects of it,

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:14.110 align:middle line:84%
that there is something real
that is inherently clear here

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:19.260 align:middle line:84%
that there is a movement between
one dimension and another

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:84%
that is being recorded in
these historical tales.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mike, dreams
of premonitions and ESP,

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:90%
is that a type of time travel?

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I believe
so, especially dreams.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.130 align:middle line:84%
When we are asleep, we enter
into different brainwave states.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And when we enter into
those different states,

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness is on a
completely different level.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And many times our
consciousness will

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.780 align:middle line:84%
drift off to other
points in time,

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:84%
observe that, and
bring it back with us.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:90%
We wake up.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, that was an
interesting dream.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And then a day, a
week, a month later,

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.040 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden the entire
scene plays out in front of us.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And like, I just had
a dream about that.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Well yeah, it happened
in your dream state,

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:84%
in that state of
consciousness that your mind

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.340 align:middle line:90%
was in at the time.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But really, you had drifted
off to another point in time

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.080 align:middle line:90%
and brought it back with you.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.889 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with
ESP, when you enter

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:15.870 align:middle line:84%
into those different
states, when

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.659 align:middle line:84%
you go into a meditative
state, your consciousness

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.150 align:middle line:84%
reaches different
levels and can touch

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.110 align:middle line:84%
those moments of the
future and bring it back.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.777 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the Akashic Records?

00:34:24.777 --> 00:34:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Are they related to time travel?

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.389 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: It's all related.

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:31.159 align:middle line:84%
So the Akashic
Records, Jung's idea

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.409 align:middle line:90%
of the collective unconscious.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:33.969 align:middle line:90%
I call it eternal knowledge.

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Everything in this dimension,
the fourth dimension time,

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.540 align:middle line:84%
if it is all here, past,
present and future,

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:84%
it means all the knowledge
of the universe is here.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything that has happened
is happening will happen.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.239 align:middle line:84%
So when we tap into
whether it's the Akashic

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:51.219 align:middle line:84%
Records or the
collective unconscious,

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:54.181 align:middle line:84%
we are actually tapping into
knowledge that already exists,

00:34:54.181 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:84%
even if it's something that's
not supposed to be discovered

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.600 align:middle line:90%
for 50 or 100 years.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.220 align:middle line:10%
Like Nikola Tesla, he tapped
into all kinds of knowledge

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.010 align:middle line:10%
that was 100 years
ahead of his time.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's
what he was doing,

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.180 align:middle line:84%
was he was accessing
those records

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and downloading that
and bringing it here

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.460 align:middle line:90%
because it already exists.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.563 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does the future
ever influence the present?

00:35:15.563 --> 00:35:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: It does.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And there are some really
interesting stories here.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And I have a very personal
story that I'll share.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.350 align:middle line:90%
It's very cute, though.

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So my fiancée and I
have known each other

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.500 align:middle line:90%
since we were in first grade.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And up to this incident, we
hadn't had much interaction.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But we were in the
school library one day.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just looking
through a stack of books.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, she just
plants a kiss right on my cheek.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.340 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, whoa!

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:42.910 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out of nowhere.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Out of nowhere.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.570 align:middle line:90%
It just happened.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.168 align:middle line:90%
I'm blushing and all that.

00:35:47.168 --> 00:35:48.460 align:middle line:90%
So it was a really cute moment.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.377 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like we
were boyfriend/girlfriend

00:35:50.377 --> 00:35:51.910 align:middle line:90%
from that moment on or whatever.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.600 align:middle line:84%
It was just a one-off
incident, very bizarre.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.010 align:middle line:84%
We're in fourth grade
together, seventh grade.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And eighth grade, I
moved away, and we

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.180 align:middle line:84%
did not see each other again or
had no contact with each other

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:03.980 align:middle line:90%
for 21 years.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Social
media comes about.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.450 align:middle line:90%
We reconnect.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And I was married at the time.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:90%
She was with somebody.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.652 align:middle line:84%
So we just kind of
chatted, caught up,

00:36:12.652 --> 00:36:13.610 align:middle line:90%
hey, how are you doing?

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:13.735 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Friends.

00:36:13.735 --> 00:36:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, friends.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'd asked her
about the kiss.

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:19.725 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I have
no idea why I did that.

00:36:19.725 --> 00:36:20.525 align:middle line:90%
Just something--

00:36:20.525 --> 00:36:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did she remember it?

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: She remembered it.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, she absolutely
remembered it.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And she said something
just told me to kiss you.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.174 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:36:29.174 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So every once in a while we'd
get together, have dinner,

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:90%
catch up, that sort of thing.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple of years
ago, she came on my tour

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.740 align:middle line:90%
that I had in Ireland.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And we were both
single at the time.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.380 align:middle line:90%
We hit it off.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:90%
We got together.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to go
back to our old hometown

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.990 align:middle line:90%
and check out our old haunts.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:48.670 align:middle line:84%
We go back to the
old school, which

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:51.278 align:middle line:84%
has become a performing arts
center for the university there.

00:36:51.278 --> 00:36:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're walking the grounds,
peering through windows,

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:54.470 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:57.197 align:middle line:84%
We get to the windows
of the library.

00:36:57.197 --> 00:36:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking in, and
we're pointing at the location

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.400 align:middle line:90%
where the kiss had happened.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And they have a set up as a
little music room or something.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And she starts yelling
through the window, "kiss him!

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Kiss him!"

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're laughing about
it, having a good time.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And as we're driving
off, it kind of

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:18.800 align:middle line:90%
hits us, like, wait a minute.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:84%
She had said something
had told her to kiss me.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So was it her 40-something
year old self telling her

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:84%
six-year-old self
to, across the time--

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To do that.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.425 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: --to do that?

00:37:31.425 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the idea that there is
that reverberation through time,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.780 align:middle line:84%
that vibration that connected
those two moments, that quantum

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:39.628 align:middle line:90%
entanglement.

00:37:39.628 --> 00:37:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you remembered it?

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.212 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:42.212 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about theoretical
physics and the possibility

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.920 align:middle line:90%
of time travel?

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.015 align:middle line:90%
Was Einstein right?

00:37:50.015 --> 00:37:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Einstein had
a lot of interesting ideas

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:55.530 align:middle line:90%
about the way time worked.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And he had his concepts
of the block universe,

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.240 align:middle line:84%
which is very, very similar to
what we've been talking about.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.225 align:middle line:84%
I expanded that out
to stack time theory.

00:38:03.225 --> 00:38:04.350 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of interesting.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.930 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
looking at those concepts,

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.080 align:middle line:84%
I started doing some
research-- oh, Einstein

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.160 align:middle line:90%
has his block universe idea.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not completely
original here.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.210 align:middle line:90%
But I expanded on it.

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And so again, that
idea that all time

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.930 align:middle line:84%
is concurrent, past,
present and future,

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:24.120 align:middle line:84%
which is why he started talking
about time being an illusion.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have physicists today
that are telling us, well,

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.630 align:middle line:84%
we could travel through time
if we went to a black hole,

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.720 align:middle line:84%
basically did a
slingshot around it,

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and came back because
space and time bends

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:90%
around the black hole.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple
problems with that.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:84%
For one, we don't have a
black hole close to us.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.610 align:middle line:84%
The closest one is about
thousand light years away.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're not getting
to one any time soon.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And that, even if
you didn't cross over

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:55.830 align:middle line:84%
into the event horizon,
even if you just got close,

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:59.690 align:middle line:84%
the gravitational pull
would still rip you apart.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's just not feasible to use
a black hole as a time machine.

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your book and
on your online audiences,

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.445 align:middle line:84%
you explain how real time
travel might be possible.

00:39:11.445 --> 00:39:12.245 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:39:12.245 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:17.430 align:middle line:84%
- So when we talk about
actual time travel,

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:21.900 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about really two
of those photos in the stack,

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.620 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, resonating at
the same frequency where

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.120 align:middle line:90%
they can access each other.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And a human being would be
able to do this, I truly

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:34.310 align:middle line:84%
believe, with
their consciousness

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:39.860 align:middle line:84%
that we can enter into a
state of being in which,

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.430 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
energy, frequency, resonance,

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:47.400 align:middle line:84%
vibration, where we
could get our frequency

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to resonate at the same
frequency as these other moments

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.490 align:middle line:84%
in time to be able
to access them.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.290 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:56.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can other
people access them?

00:39:56.895 --> 00:39:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: I believe so.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I think when we talk
about real time travel,

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.390 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be a
DeLorean or a flux capacitor,

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.980 align:middle line:84%
like we see in the
movies, or a black hole

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.350 align:middle line:90%
because they're just too far.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really going to
come down to the consciousness.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It's going to take meditation.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Set that intention going
into your meditation,

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.220 align:middle line:84%
get yourself into
a meditative state,

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and take yourself to
another moment in time.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Famous poet Goethe
accidentally did this.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.830 align:middle line:84%
He was lost in his thoughts
one day, walking down a road.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And he saw what ended
up being himself

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.790 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the road.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Didn't realize it until years
later when he was walking down

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.710 align:middle line:84%
that road again in
the opposite direction

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and he just happened
to be wearing

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:41.260 align:middle line:84%
the same garb that he had in
that vision that he'd seen.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But he had been in this
slightly meditative state

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.360 align:middle line:84%
when that happened as he
was lost in his thoughts.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But I believe if we are able
to concentrate that meditation,

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.170 align:middle line:84%
we would be able
to take ourselves

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.545 align:middle line:84%
to these other moments in time
through our consciousness.

00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:57.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mike, will technology
allow us to time-travel?

00:40:57.337 --> 00:40:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I think
where technology

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:04.250 align:middle line:84%
will come into play on this is
not the entirety of the time

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.050 align:middle line:90%
travel.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.467 align:middle line:84%
I believe-- again, it will
come down to the consciousness.

00:41:07.467 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But the trick is, as
I was saying there,

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:90%
tuning into those frequencies.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Now these frequencies fluctuate.

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think where technology
would be able to help us,

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:19.770 align:middle line:84%
it would be able to hold
on to the correct frequency

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:20.950 align:middle line:90%
so that we can maintain it.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just a time slip
that we are experiencing,

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.330 align:middle line:90%
but actual real time travel.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
you working on next?

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: Right now,
I am working on my book

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.600 align:middle line:84%
on stargates, which still
touches on time travel

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.680 align:middle line:84%
because, again, stargates and
portals have that connection

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.978 align:middle line:90%
to other moments in time.

00:41:38.978 --> 00:41:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you ever
go through a portal

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:41.723 align:middle line:90%
if you found one?

00:41:41.723 --> 00:41:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: I would.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I would be so curious as to
what would be on the other side.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.687 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I would do,
though, is I would leave

00:41:46.687 --> 00:41:48.083 align:middle line:90%
a note behind because so many--

00:41:48.083 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
that note say?

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.083 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: I would let them
know that this is where I'm at.

00:41:52.083 --> 00:41:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm stepping into this portal.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If I don't come back--

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.208 align:middle line:90%
>>RICKSECKER: Try to find me.

00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:84%
If I don't return, yeah,
here's my last will.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:01.000 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I would be curious
enough to venture through it.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you go
into one and you

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:07.920 align:middle line:84%
believe they exist,
how can you come back?

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>RICKSECKER: That's
a great question.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.100 align:middle line:10%
So you would have
to try, of course,

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.610 align:middle line:10%
to find the portal to go back.

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:20.400 align:middle line:10%
Now, where your point of
travel occurs, I believe,

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.650 align:middle line:10%
would at least be an
energetic enough spot

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:24.987 align:middle line:10%
that you could
harness that energy

00:42:24.987 --> 00:42:26.070 align:middle line:10%
to be able to travel back.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Again, the trick
would be, how do

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:30.150 align:middle line:84%
you tune into that
right frequency

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:31.960 align:middle line:90%
to get back to the right moment?

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think that's
where the intention prior

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:37.020 align:middle line:90%
to the meditation comes in.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the
ancients, when we look back

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.940 align:middle line:84%
at ancient Egypt
and the stargates

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.270 align:middle line:84%
there, that they knew how
to be able to do that,

that they could basically
plug in an address and go.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.440 align:middle line:84%
We've lost that
technology over the years.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.390 align:middle line:84%

could reacquire it.

>>NOORY: How do people
find you, Michael?

my website, mikericksecker.com.

Keep up the good

>>RICKSECKER: Thank you, George.

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:09.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll let Mike, do it.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
