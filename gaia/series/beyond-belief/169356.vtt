[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:19.252 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory and our
special guest in this program

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:10%
is Sarah Adams, a
multidimensional coach who

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:10%
has experienced many things
from abductions to angels,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:10%
and Sarah has memories of past
lives in Egypt, Atlantis--

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:10%
even life on Mars.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy and intuition,
quantum leaping and time travel

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
are among some of the
other alternative realities

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Sarah lives.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Sarah is also here to talk
about her special work

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:84%
through DNA, the God gene,
and how energy works.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Sarah, welcome to the program.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SARAH ADAMS: Thank you.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me on.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looking forward to
the-- what a varied background

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.256 align:middle line:90%
How did this all happen for you?

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: So, since
I was a child,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:10%
I've experienced a lot of
things, and every single day,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:10%
visions, past life memories,
interaction with different

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:10%
beings--

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:10%
it's quite magical
on every level.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And through all of this,
remembering past memories,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I have sort of realized how
energy works and all of that.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
scared in the beginning

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.177 align:middle line:84%
when all this was
starting to happen to you?

00:01:22.177 --> 00:01:23.385 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No, I wasn't scared.

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I think I couldn't
live without it.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:10%
I think that for me, it's
beautiful to sort of access all

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.480 align:middle line:10%
of those things.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.046 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it easy to access?

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: For me, yes.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:90%
I astral project.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:90%
I have visions.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I feel what
people are feeling.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite easy for
me to do those things.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had one
astral projection

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:90%
when I was 11 years old.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I was bouncing on the ceiling,
looking down at my body,

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and then it slammed
me back down.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But I've never been
able to do it since.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.632 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing wrong?

00:01:57.632 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: This is where it comes
down to genetics or the God

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:84%
gene, which they're doing quite
a bit of work on, and it sort

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:84%
of aligns to the
work that I'm doing--

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
what researchers and
scientists are finding on that.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the charge
we have in our bodies.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:90%
The less charge, you--

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:90%
you're less multidimensional.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.280 align:middle line:84%
The more charge you
have within yourself,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
the more you're
multidimensional.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:84%
In the end, we're
energetic beings.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:90%
I believe this.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.297 align:middle line:90%
Our souls, you know.

00:02:24.297 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
The charge we have in our bodies
that keeps us alive and keeps

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:90%
us moving right now, it's--

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.180 align:middle line:84%
we're energy, and once we
learn how to manage that,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:84%
we can go in and
out of our bodies.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in Atlantis,
they did this in Egypt,

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.410 align:middle line:84%
they did this in many,
many ancient civilizations.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
They moved between the worlds
of non-matter and matter.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we have the
ability, then, to change that

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:90%
by learning more techniques?

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: We do.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we have the
ability to light up our DNA.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:84%
When we light up our
DNA, what this does

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
is the DNA is sort of
a antenna for energy.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And as we work on gathering
more energy into our DNA

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and lighten ourselves
up, that streams

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:84%
it right into us
and to ourselves

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:90%
and to our whole system.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is why the
Egyptians were sun worshippers.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: They were charging
themselves through that,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.895 align:middle line:84%
and this would allow them to
be multidimensional and have

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:90%
bodies of light.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:90%
So I believe it's possible.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have had past
memories of Egypt, Mars,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis--

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:84%
how do you recollect
those things?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I remembered a lot of
it since I was a little child.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's sort of vast.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll just
have a flashback.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.950 align:middle line:84%
When something similar
happens in this life,

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:84%
it'll remind me of what
happened in that life.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I had one the other day
with a good friend of mine

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
who actually works
with you guys,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and I had a flashback of
my life back in Egypt.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:90%
So it sort of works like that.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
sometimes overlap

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.845 align:middle line:84%
your current existence--
your current life,

00:04:08.845 --> 00:04:10.863 align:middle line:90%
where it's confusing for you?

00:04:10.863 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Mmm, no.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes
it shows me the people

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:84%
in this life I've
known sometimes

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:84%
back in those other
lives, so it shows me

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:90%
if they were good for me.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
It shows me a lot about
them, so it provides me

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
a larger view of what's really
happening on different levels.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's amazing,
because I found people

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and they found me, that I've
known from those lives that

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:84%
were just beautiful and
loving and caring towards me,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's followed
me into this life.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many past
lives can we have?

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I'd say infinite.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.600 align:middle line:90%
I'd say infinite.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Once when I went back, I
went back two billion years

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and that sounds--

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Two billion years?

00:04:51.105 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.458 align:middle line:84%
It was the most
magical experience.

00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:56.125 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
things look like then?

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: You know, it
was before this planet.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.699 align:middle line:84%
It was when other planets
were inhabited and before--

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.865 align:middle line:84%
I speak a lot about these
great wars that happened--

00:05:03.865 --> 00:05:04.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:04.665 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: But before then.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I had all of this--

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I was in this deep meditation,
and I just went back and back

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and back, and I saw
all these lives,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.916 align:middle line:84%
and it was like
almost a film roll.

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, when
you see everything

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
flashing before on a film roll
when they do it very quickly.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I went back
two billion years.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have had
recollections and theories

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:90%
of the Anunnaki.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Zecharia Sitchin claims they
came here and genetically

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:90%
altered us.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:90%
What do you see with them?

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: With Anunnaki, I
believe that they walk in human

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
form and they live in the worlds
of non-matter or the energetic

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.060 align:middle line:90%
worlds--

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:90%
the worlds of energy--

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that
they come in and out.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:10%
I don't believe that
they're extinct.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:90%
I believe that they currently--

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:84%
they're working towards
helping the world.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I do also believe that
with the Anunnaki,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
that the depictions of angels,
of aliens, of all of that--

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:90%
they're all the same beings.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
physical or dimensional?

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So I believe
like when we had--

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, the Egyptian
kings and queens--

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they were direct
Anunnaki in physical form,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that the Egyptian
bloodline comes all the way

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:90%
back from Mars.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Theoretical
physicist Michio Kaku

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
has talked about
multi-dimensions, as well.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>> We believe, though
we cannot yet prove,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
that our multiverse of
universes is 11-dimensional.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:10%
So think of this 11-dimensional
arena, and in this arena,

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.080 align:middle line:10%
there are bubbles--

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.040 align:middle line:10%
bubbles that float-- and
the skin of the bubble

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:10%
represents an entire universe.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:10%
So we're like flies
trapped on flypaper.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:90%
We're on the skin of a bubble.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a three-dimensional bubble.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
The three-dimensional
bubble is expanding,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's called
the Big Bang Theory.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, these bubbles
can bump into each other.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they can split
apart, and that, we think,

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:90%
is the Big Bang.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.977 align:middle line:84%
So we even have a theory
of the Big Bang itself.

00:07:10.977 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Now you ask a question--
what about the dimensions

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:90%
of each bubble?

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, in string theory, which
is what I do for a living--

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:90%
that's my day job.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:84%
In string theory,
we can have bubbles

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.450 align:middle line:90%
of different dimensions.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:90%
The highest dimension is 11.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go beyond 11, because
universes become unstable

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:90%
beyond 11.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
If I write down the theory of
a 13-, 15-dimensional universe,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:84%
it's unstable, and it collapses
down to an 11-dimensional

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.156 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you agree
with that, Sarah?

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Hmm.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:84%
I access a lot of dimensions,
and even lifetime-- lives

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
happen in sort of
alternate universes.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So I-- and it's
almost layered for me,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:84%
because of the fact
that when you're

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.570 align:middle line:84%
go in higher dimensions that
are higher frequency, that

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:84%
have more energy in them,
there's very beautiful things,

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and then there's lower
where there's less energy.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that we
live in multiverses,

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
don't know this.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And a long time ago, like
I said, they were a bit--

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
they could go in
and out because they

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
could go in and out of their
bodies and access all of that

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
before the Bible
says the fall of man.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Fall of
[? frequency, ?] rather than

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.130 align:middle line:90%
how people believe it happened.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe with
the fact that yes, there

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.250 align:middle line:84%
are many universes
and many dimensions,

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and people sometimes
tap into these,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and that's why sometimes
they're tapping

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:84%
into dimensions where there's
different beings that exist.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of these lower levels,
would that be called hell?

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I knew it.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.438 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't want to
hang around there, do you?

00:08:49.438 --> 00:08:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: [LAUGHING]
The underworld--

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
it's definitely where you can
get blocked off from light,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:90%
and yes, it's not a nice place--

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.346 align:middle line:90%
not the best place.

00:09:00.346 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
dimensions are there,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and do we live in all of them
at the same time or separately?

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: It really depends.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who are
seeing ghosts and stuff

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:90%
are accessing other dimensions.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.854 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we exist in more
than one at the same time?

00:09:16.854 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: People are
existing in more than one,

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:84%
because your soul energy is
the flow of the universe,

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:90%
so that's flowing everywhere.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
You just-- you're not collecting
that information right,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.975 align:middle line:84%
because the body, when
it-- on a cellular level,

00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:33.454 align:middle line:84%
if it's-- you know,
with everything and--

00:09:33.454 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
There's additives in
everything, there's

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.578 align:middle line:84%
heavy metals in
everything-- that's

00:09:36.578 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:84%
blocking on a cellular level
so you're not flowing right,

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
so you're not collecting
all the information.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I had one experience where I
lived a whole life in another--

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.160 align:middle line:90%
in a multiverse.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And had all that
information come to me.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:90%
I experienced it.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: While you
had your other life.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Oh, yeah.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:90%
This year, yes.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was there a preference?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: [LAUGHING] You
know, I really enjoyed living

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt--

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.479 align:middle line:84%
You know, they used the
ice caps and the crystals,

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and the ice caps along with
the crystals and the ocean.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.440 align:middle line:84%
You had the crystals in the body
and they could bring planets.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Just like I said, I'd
bring myself up and down.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.090 align:middle line:84%
They could bring the
planets up and down.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:90%
It was just magical.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So I have preferred some
lifetimes where I think--

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:84%
before humanity forgot all
the information, and got here,

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:90%
but I think--

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I always try to see the
best in everything, so--

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Perfect.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And I have a lot
of lovely people in my life,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:90%
so it's good.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you demonstrate for
us how you get into this mode?

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Is it a meditation?

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.480 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: So-- OK.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I sort of can bring
myself up, almost

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.044 align:middle line:90%
like revving up a car's engine.

00:10:47.044 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you do that?

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: So what I do is--
we have power over our cells

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:10%
and each cell is either going--

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:10%
each cell is like a solar
panel, and the thing

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:10%
is, you know, in society--

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to try to
explain this the best I can--

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.181 align:middle line:10%
in society, we see
ourselves just being in 3D.

00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
We don't see ourselves
as multidimensional

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:90%
and this is a huge problem.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So we are not taking care of
our chakra systems-- our aura.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, each cell is
like a solar panel.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.190 align:middle line:84%
When we eat food that's
full of energy, when we're

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.530 align:middle line:90%
in the sun, when we have love--

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:84%
that goes into the
cell, through the cell,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and charges our aura system
and our chakra system,

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.470 align:middle line:84%
thus making us more
high-vibrational.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Most people in
society, I believe,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.530 align:middle line:90%
are starving of energy.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they're
in deficit of energy

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:84%
because they-- a long time
ago, they lost how this works--

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.340 align:middle line:84%
how our aura and chakra
system is directly

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:90%
tied to our physical body--

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
the physical plane
that we live on.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I'm
able to literally

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:84%
take control of all my
body on a cellular level

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:90%
and just sort of rev it up.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is I do
very strong intent.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Will is very, very
important, and what I do

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:84%
is I'll just imagine
my body sort of going

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:84%
like a light
emanating in my body,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'll do that and do that and
do that intently until I feel

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm like out of
this world almost,

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:90%
and then I can leave my body.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do that in
the privacy of your home?

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Can you do it when you're
outside at a restaurant?

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to be
in a certain place?

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I have had experiences
where I suddenly am just out

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.210 align:middle line:90%
of my body, around--

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just gone.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Just out of it
and I am somewhere else.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
But I prefer to keep
control and doing that when

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm laying down,
when I-- you know,

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:84%
not driving a
vehicle or something.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's not smart.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.950 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to do that.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
say this is all about?

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:90%
What are we tapping into?

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
about these other higher

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.305 align:middle line:84%
dimensions and places,
what are they actually?

00:12:54.305 --> 00:12:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: There's the most--

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's the most
ancient beings that live there.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:84%
That's as much as
this world for people,

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.860 align:middle line:84%
there's those beings there,
and I believe that again, they

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:90%
want the illumination of man.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:84%
They want man to
understand that man isn't

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:90%
the only one in the universe.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:10%
That there are many
dimensions that he can access,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:10%
and he only has to
stop being a copilot

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.176 align:middle line:10%
and become a pilot
of himself, and he's

00:13:24.176 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:10%
got to become a
pilot of himself,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:10%
and he needs to understand that
he's not just a physical form,

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:10%
but he's also an energetic form.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:10%
He is a divine consciousness
from very long ago that has

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.920 align:middle line:10%
forgotten who he is
and how powerful he is

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:10%
and how he can interact,
and this, I think, is the--

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:10%
for me, at least,
this is the outcome

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:10%
of beings in these dimensions.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what they want--

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.660 align:middle line:90%
for humanity to reconnect.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you interact
with them often?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes, all the time.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:90%
When I was very sick--

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I was very sick after
my fiance passed away,

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and they came to me, and
they were very healing to me,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:90%
and they gave me energy.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I knew I needed
a lot of energy to heal.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And I remember them--
just sort of golden beings

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:84%
put their sort of hands over
me and streamed this energy

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:90%
directly into me.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Without their
help, how difficult

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:90%
would things have been for you?

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I think that my
body probably would not have

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:90%
survived what I went through.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was that--

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.529 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: It was that dramatic.

00:14:30.529 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I lost a lot of energy trying
to heal a certain person when

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:90%
they passed away, so yes.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not easy, is it?

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.354 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Mm-mm.

00:14:38.354 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late
William Tompkins

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:84%
spoke about the Nazis
and their dealings

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:84%
with striking a dark deal with
the other side with reptilians

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:90%
for advanced technology.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:10%
>> They had developed,
or they had been given,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.730 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic
antigravitational propulsion

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.420 align:middle line:10%
by the reptilians.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
The agreement
turned out that they

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:07.420 align:middle line:84%
were to develop a parallel space
Navy that the reptilians had

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and operate out through the
galaxy with the reptilians

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
taking over planets and slaving
the people on the planets.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarah, are there
are dark sides out there?

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: As much as
there's light sides,

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:90%
there's dark sides.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would call it evil.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Is it there?

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that that exists,
but I also believe that--

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I have a very personal belief on
this, and that's just my view.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe-- I don't
know if you've ever seen

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.490 align:middle line:90%
the movie "The Dark Crystal."

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It's a very
famous movie by Jim Henson,

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and in the end, even the dark
beings-- they wanted light.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was dark
was just in need of light,

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and once that light was streamed
to them, they were all healed.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Everything was healed.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.880 align:middle line:84%
The universe is as a
symphony, and right now, I

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.652 align:middle line:84%
feel like it's a
symphony that is not--

00:15:58.652 --> 00:16:01.604 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.604 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:90%
it's messed up.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.635 align:middle line:84%
It's not playing
the right symphony.

00:16:04.635 --> 00:16:05.856 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's conducting it?

00:16:05.856 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Is there a conductor?

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: [INHALING DEEPLY]
Ah, you know,

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:90%
I believe in this force--

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:84%
this ancient force that
runs throughout universes

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and multiverses and dimensions
as an energy, and I believe--

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it God?

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.562 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:90%
That's what I tap into.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe a man
sitting in-- in a man sitting

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:90%
in heaven.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.934 align:middle line:90%
I believe in this force.

00:16:24.934 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In the force.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it the force,
Sarah, that created us?

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:10%
I believe that we manifested
from energy into matter,

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:10%
and I think that that took
a couple of manifestations

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:10%
before we got to the matter
form that we are in right now.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's a
three-dimensional level,

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:48.035 align:middle line:84%
and have you ever had a
contact experience in that?

00:16:48.035 --> 00:16:48.835 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Ooh.

00:16:48.835 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] I usually like going
up above like seven dimensions.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You go
beyond the three?

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.177 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I go way--

00:16:58.177 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING] yes.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.824 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people are like,
oh, only five dimensions.

00:17:03.824 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you always have
some experience, though,

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.299 align:middle line:90%
in any dimension that you--

00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Oh, yes.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --reside in?

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:09.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:84%
I-- OK, so once
I left my body, I

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:84%
got all the way to one
of the moons near Saturn,

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.874 align:middle line:84%
and so I had a hard time
coming back from there.

00:17:18.874 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
extraterrestrial contact?

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Oh, yes.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I've-- aquatic beings,
these blue beings,

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:84%
some sort of beings
that are very--

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:90%
they have a lot of feathers.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Of course--

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Avians?

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.239 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Yes, but they
don't express their names

00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:90%
as-- it's a--

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:90%
they don't speak like this.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
They speak in their
frequency, so it's not words.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.290 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever been abducted?

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Have I?

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Willingly, I've been-- you know,
I have been in a ship where I

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
saw a lot of hybrid children,
and I was told that they were

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:84%
not connecting right
to the mothers,

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:84%
because the hybrid ET
children, they were telepathic,

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.350 align:middle line:90%
and the mothers were not--

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:90%
the human mothers.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:84%
There was this disconnect, and
it was causing so much stress

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.300 align:middle line:84%
on these little
small ET babies, so I

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
was asked to connect
to all of them

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and just give them a
lot of love and energy

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and remove the negative
stress energy that was causing

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.174 align:middle line:90%
their body to malfunction.

00:18:16.174 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
able to do that?

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I was able to do that.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I saw that these kids were
also sort of infiltrated

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:84%
into humanity to try to bring
consciousness by doing--

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:90%
so I did see that.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.399 align:middle line:84%
That was quite a long
time ago, though.

00:18:31.399 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there
are the Anunnaki

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and I believe their
children are the Nephilim,

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:90%
so they're the hybrids.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Are some
government leaders

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.386 align:middle line:10%
involved with some
strange ET connection?

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I can't
talk about that.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.601 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:47.179 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I-- I won't
talk about that.

00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I have specific reasons of
why I won't talk about that.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you have
knowledge of something?

00:18:51.245 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:90%
But you can't--

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.958 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I have a
lot of knowledge.

00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.580 align:middle line:10%
If I access-- if--

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.627 align:middle line:10%
OK, considering that I access--

00:18:56.627 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You're
scaring me now, Sarah.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Considering I access
this energy that flows through

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:90%
me that I call God--

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't I be able to
see a lot of things?

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.211 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You should be able to.

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:07.085 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: Exactly.

00:19:07.085 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So--

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.798 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So I know
a lot of things.

00:19:08.798 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If I'm reading you
right, the things that you see

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
are kind of scary or
dangerous to talk about.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.500 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I would say that
humanity-- certain people

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:10%
and humanity that have
positions of power,

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:10%
and they think it's
real power, because they

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:10%
think that sitting in status
is above others is real power.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's the
problems they have

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.352 align:middle line:84%
within themselves
and the lack of power

00:19:34.352 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
they feel within themselves
because they're not

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:84%
connected how they
should be to God,

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
so they think that sitting
in powerful places, that's

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.090 align:middle line:90%
some sort of power.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:10%
And many times, they
do things that they

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't be doing, and--

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I get it.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: --they don't realize
that by working together--

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
humanity working
together, consciousness,

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the world-- you know, we have
such things as technology.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:90%
You have a cell phone.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:10%
That is very
primitive technology.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:84%
All of the
electronics we have is

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.370 align:middle line:90%
primitive technology to what--

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:90%
where I come from and where I--

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.489 align:middle line:84%
ancient civilizations
who could teleport

00:20:12.489 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and everything because they
had power over their cells.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
They had light technology,
which is something

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.479 align:middle line:84%
I hope is spoken
about in the future,

00:20:19.479 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and they're now
using this, you know.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.478 align:middle line:84%
They're finding out that light
affects cells and everything

00:20:23.478 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:10%
That light technology also
accesses other realms,

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:10%
because it's in the
rainbow light spectrum that

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:10%
accesses other realms.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.360 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't get too much
into that this interview,

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:84%
but the thing is that they
had these technologies,

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and they've accessed
them, and they're not

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.099 align:middle line:84%
using them to help
and heal the world.

00:20:42.099 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:10%
They're using them, I believe--

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: To hurt.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: --to hurt.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.291 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not good.

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: --you know, eventually
that's going to stop,

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
because there is higher
forces that won't

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:90%
allow that to continue on.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:84%
They want humanity to heal
and humanity not to be used.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hope they win--

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:90%
The good ones.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Isn't it funny?

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.487 align:middle line:90%
Think about it, though.

00:21:02.487 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Think about in Egypt how it
said that the ancients which

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:90%
resurrect.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Think about that, right?

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Think about all the cloning
and stuff that went on,

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and you know if they
found the bodies of those,

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.100 align:middle line:84%
they probably cloned them
and brought them back.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:90%
So think about it.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.733 align:middle line:84%
They would sort of be
fulfilling a prophecy.

00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Think about that.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And for their
own gain, they would--

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:84%
they want to use for
weapons or whatever else,

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:84%
but think about the fact
that they would be fulfilling

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:32.030 align:middle line:84%
prophecies of things much higher
than them and more advanced

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.430 align:middle line:90%
without them even knowing it--

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
just their want for greed
and power and whatever else.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.834 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can our DNA
connect with some of this?

00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Do you remember--
have you ever heard

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:90%
of Jacob's ladder in the Bible--

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:43.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, yeah.

00:21:43.745 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: --where
he-- that's how he

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:90%
climbs up and sees the angels.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:90%
The ladder is the DNA.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe that when we
find our inner power,

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.130 align:middle line:84%
we will no longer need
leaders around the world,

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:90%
because we will--

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:84%
when we find the inner power
and we access this force,

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:90%
we won't--

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.780 align:middle line:84%
we will have only
compassion and caring.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We will not have
a lack of energy.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.467 align:middle line:84%
Lack of energy creates a
person who is depressed

00:22:07.467 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.966 align:middle line:84%
When you have that
energy flow, you just

00:22:09.966 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:90%
feel happy and well, and just--

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.830 align:middle line:84%
you're not scared of anything,
because you know no matter

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.730 align:middle line:84%
what happens to you,
you're connected to this.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't really die.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.910 align:middle line:84%
This is just like
a bit of a movie.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Just like us sitting
here filming.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But not everybody
with the DNA experience

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:90%
have the ability to contact.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Because of the
whole thing of being--

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
this is where that
humanity needs

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:84%
to learn how their genetics
work, how energy works,

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.070 align:middle line:90%
and how they can light that up.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And when they do, everybody
will have that experience,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:84%
because everybody in
the world has DNA,

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and DNA has that ability to
access higher energy and stream

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.010 align:middle line:90%
that in when used properly.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: It's a
tool, and you either

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:84%
can use a tool the
wrong way and it's not

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:84%
going to work, or the right
way, and it will work.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When we die, in
your opinion, what happens?

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: That all souls return
back to the realms of energy.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we reincarnate?

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:90%
I believe that there is choice.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:84%
You can come back here or
you can go to other worlds.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:90%
You can go to other dimensions.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:84%
It's your choice, and it's
also depending on what

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:90%
you have done in your life.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:84%
If you've been a
pilot and you've

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.930 align:middle line:84%
made good choices for
yourself and others,

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:90%
I think that counts.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:90%
And what happens--

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if you've
made a bad choices?

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I think that you have
to pass through some karmic

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.020 align:middle line:84%
lessons to understand
that that's not the--

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that you should do
better than that.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was an old
book called "The Projections

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of the Astral Body" years ago by
Hereward Carrington and Sylvan

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Muldoon, and they
talked about going

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
through various stages of the
dimensions in the astral plane,

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and they said the higher up you
got, the more heavenly it got.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they were
petrified of the lower realm.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever seen that realm?

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I've seen
all the realms.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:10%
I've--

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.191 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Not that you'd be
staying in the lower realms,

00:24:04.191 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:10%
by any means.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, you have
seen it, though?

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I have seen it.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:08.820 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.064 align:middle line:84%
When I got very ill,
the lack of energy--

00:24:11.064 --> 00:24:12.230 align:middle line:90%
so this is how energy works.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like in
a balloon, you know,

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:16.310 align:middle line:90%
with the helium floats up.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.859 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: The more energy you
have, the more you go up.

00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:21.190 align:middle line:84%
The less energy, the
more you go down.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:90%
So I was--

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.440 align:middle line:84%
I did get to those
realms at one point,

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and yes, it's not
a very nice place.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I can say to you,
the highest realm

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
that I got was where I just
sort of became everything--

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.520 align:middle line:90%
where I was just energy.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the highest
place that I ever got.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you scared
of that lower realm?

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: I'm not--

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
I'm sure you don't

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:41.900 align:middle line:90%
want to hang around there.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I'm not
scared of anything.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
fear is a good thing.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.800 align:middle line:10%
I believe understanding
is a better thing,

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.460 align:middle line:10%
and it's sort of like--

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.700 align:middle line:10%
I think that it's
just the universe.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like we're
children, and if we misbehave,

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to
learn our lessons on that.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that people
just will burn eternally

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:90%
in hell or anything like that.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I do believe you get to
go to different stages

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:84%
and understand why
you should act better.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about our
role with extraterrestrials?

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the ability
to communicate with them?

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're out there?

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.388 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: They will
only communicate

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:84%
with those who understand
that their energy body,

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
how it works, and those
who illuminate themselves--

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:84%
those who put the
energy into themselves.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:84%
When I was a small child, I
was near one of my parents

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and I spoke to a being for some
hours, and this being told me--

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.650 align:middle line:84%
you know, it told me
that people grow up.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
This is why children-- there's
a lot-- children see beings

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:48.930 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: And they
explained to me this--

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:56.700 align:middle line:84%
is that when people grow older,
they collect this sort of--

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
this negative energy
or dark energy

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.860 align:middle line:84%
around their aura
system, and what happens

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:84%
is that blocks them off-- sort
of creates a wall between them

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:90%
and these energy beings.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So this blocks them
from communicating,

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and that humanity will be
illuminated eventually.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And in this
illumination, they will

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:84%
learn how to clear
themselves so that they

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.860 align:middle line:84%
can interact with other
interdimensional beings that

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:90%
are energetic.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Many parents try to
discourage little people--

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.300 align:middle line:84%
their youngsters-- of playing
with these imaginary beings.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Is that smart to
do that, or not?

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I'd say unless you
think it's something dark,

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.370 align:middle line:90%
I would not.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:36.900 align:middle line:90%
I would be OK with it.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe a lot of angels
and a lot of high beings

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.800 align:middle line:84%
visit children,
because I believe

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to keep that
energy flow coming through

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:84%
from the energetic worlds
through these children,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:84%
hoping that these children
will have that open gate

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.089 align:middle line:84%
and grow up and be able to bring
that information to humanity,

00:26:53.089 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:84%
because the whole point is
about illuminating humanity.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've talked a
lot about consciousness

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and these
interdimensional beings,

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.490 align:middle line:90%
and how that all works together.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a Gaia show
called "Missing Links"

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:84%
with Gregg Braden, and he has
talked about these aspects

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> So here's what I did.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I replaced the letters
in the ancient text

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:84%
with the elements of
the periodic table.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:24.060 align:middle line:10%
And when I did that
and applied it to DNA--

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:28.230 align:middle line:10%
because DNA is made of hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.390 align:middle line:10%
in different combinations.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:32.970 align:middle line:84%
When I took the
ancient alphabets

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:37.380 align:middle line:84%
and I replaced the elements of
the DNA with those alphabets,

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:41.700 align:middle line:84%
the DNA began to read as you
read the letters in a sentence

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.710 align:middle line:90%
in the page upon a book.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA holds a
message that can only

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:84%
be read by crossing the
traditional boundaries

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.560 align:middle line:84%
of science and
spirituality, and it

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:84%
helps us one more piece with
this clue of our origin.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the very
first sentence--

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:01.590 align:middle line:84%
the very first line of every
strand of every human DNA--

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:05.280 align:middle line:84%
says exactly the same thing,
and here's what it says--

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:84%
when we place those letters
with the periodic table

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and we begin reading the
text, the very first sentence

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.540 align:middle line:84%
in every strand of DNA
literally says the words,

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.490 align:middle line:90%
"God eternal within the body."

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's pretty
dramatic stuff we just saw.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: But everybody is God.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is God.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:90%
You think we're all gods?

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I think that your
soul is a part of God.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:36.830 align:middle line:10%
It's God flowing in material
and matter in your body,

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:10%
so everybody is God.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that in ancient
text and including the Bible,

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that Christ, or Jesus,
was trying-- and Jesus,

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:84%
if you-- in French is
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH] means

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:90%
"I am."

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was trying to
say, "I am--" God said,

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.770 align:middle line:84%
"I am that I am" in
the Bible, that you

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:90%
are God within yourself.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
The temple-- he stated
the temple was your body.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
He didn't state it
was anywhere else.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.766 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he was against
the religions of that day

00:29:06.766 --> 00:29:08.140 align:middle line:84%
where they worshipped
in temples.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:84%
He was saying that each person
was God within themselves--

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.722 align:middle line:90%
a piece of God.

00:29:13.722 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:90%
They were all-powerful.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm looking at you now,
Sarah, and I don't read auras,

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.690 align:middle line:84%
but you have a glow
all around you.

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:90%
It's almost heavenly.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's weird.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed
that on yourself?

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: I know very
well what I am, yes,

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.496 align:middle line:10%
and why I'm in this world.

00:29:32.496 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What am I noticing?

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: So I have gold.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
read about the alchemy of--

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:42.520 align:middle line:84%
to try and change into the
whole Philosopher's Stone

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.520 align:middle line:90%
to change into gold.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: See, I
have a rainbow aura,

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.659 align:middle line:90%
and around that, I have gold.

00:29:49.659 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you generating
this, or is it just--

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --there.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.171 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I generate
this quite a bit.

00:29:55.171 --> 00:29:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I have a picture of
it on my Facebook.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:90%
When they-- I got an aura photo.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:90%
I had told them--

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.292 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I have a rainbow aura."

00:30:02.292 --> 00:30:04.750 align:middle line:84%
When they took a picture of
it, they saw that with the gold

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.020 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In pictures of--

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:84%
biblical pictures of Jesus
or the blessed Virgin Mary,

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.350 align:middle line:84%
they have this glow around them,
too-- this aura around them.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.614 align:middle line:84%
Could people see
that in those days?

00:30:19.614 --> 00:30:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: When you have that
sort of energy, everybody can.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people tell me this.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or you
feel it, at least?

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: So they were depicted
with a golden crown-- so

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:90%
the golden halo.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.620 align:middle line:90%
And think about it.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Kings and queens
wear golden crowns.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.401 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: OK, originally
the whole symbolism

00:30:34.401 --> 00:30:36.910 align:middle line:84%
with kings and queens
is that the golden crown

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.400 align:middle line:84%
meant they were connected
to God-- the crown chakra.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.280 align:middle line:84%
All the gems meant things
such as nobility, dignity,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:90%
and everything else--

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:90%
all the different colors.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So it would represent
the rainbow chakra

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:84%
with the golden crown, thus
the gold around the aura.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is the God
genome and DNA so important

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.989 align:middle line:90%
in all of this?

00:30:57.989 --> 00:30:59.780 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: So they're
finding out that people

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:04.550 align:middle line:10%
who are psychic or people
who are very prophetic

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:10%
or just experience
supernatural things,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.000 align:middle line:10%
have a gene-- the God gene.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.280 align:middle line:90%
What they call the God gene.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.730 align:middle line:90%
That gives them this ability?

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Right.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that we can light
up, or that with certain--

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.480 align:middle line:84%
whether it's food, whether
it's relationships, anything--

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:90%
we either light up our DNA--

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.440 align:middle line:84%
if it's empowering, it
brings energy into us,

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:90%
or we turn it off.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.622 align:middle line:84%
And the more we turn it
off, the more we're very--

00:31:28.622 --> 00:31:31.910 align:middle line:84%
we access just lower things
and we have very unhappy lives.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:84%
The more we turn this on--
the more we access God--

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: --and the more that
we access a lot of supernatural

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:43.390 align:middle line:84%
things that are quite
beautiful, so I would--

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.230 align:middle line:84%
these are my beliefs
on it, of course.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.900 align:middle line:84%
With the God gene, of
course-- think about it--

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.080 align:middle line:84%
in the book of Genesis,
"gene-" "-isis."

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Now think about it--

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.710 align:middle line:90%
that "is, is."

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.360 align:middle line:90%
I am, I am.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:84%
The book of Genesis is
actually, I believe, encoded

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.080 align:middle line:90%
about the God gene.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Probably.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.211 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's right
there, but it's a code.

00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:09.480 align:middle line:90%


00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Are you on a personal mission
to teach people something?

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: No.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not on a personal
mission to teach anybody.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm on-- I don't believe
in teaching people.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I believe in of saying what
I feel and what I experience

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and what God
streams to me, and I

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:84%
believe that that will affect
people in a very positive way

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and they will use that.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.020 align:middle line:84%
There will be quite
a few people who

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:84%
will use that to
empower themselves

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and to sort of understand that
they are divine, and I would--

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:43.500 align:middle line:84%
this is my want, that
everybody understands just how

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.547 align:middle line:90%
divine they are.

00:32:44.547 --> 00:32:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They say that
consciousness is very

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.270 align:middle line:90%
unique to living organisms.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Here is a neuroscientist
who will discuss this--

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Anil Seth.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>> As computers get
faster and smarter,

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.180 align:middle line:84%
maybe there will come a
point, maybe not too far away,

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.030 align:middle line:84%
when my iPhone develops a
sense of its own existence.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I actually think the
prospects for a conscious AI

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.456 align:middle line:84%
are pretty remote, and I think
that's because my research is

00:33:08.456 --> 00:33:09.830 align:middle line:84%
telling me that
consciousness has

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.930 align:middle line:84%
less to do with
pure intelligence

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and more to do with our
nature as living and breathing

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.640 align:middle line:90%
organisms.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.015 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things.

00:33:19.015 --> 00:33:20.630 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be smart to suffer,

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.912 align:middle line:84%
but you probably do
have to be alive.

00:33:23.912 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And the story I'm
going to tell you

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.953 align:middle line:84%
are conscious
experiences of the world

00:33:26.953 --> 00:33:29.330 align:middle line:84%
around us and of
ourselves within it

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:84%
are kinds of controlled
hallucinations

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:37.010 align:middle line:84%
that happen with, through, and
because of our living bodies.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.710 align:middle line:10%
Now you might have
heard that we know

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.330 align:middle line:10%
nothing about how the
brain and body give rise

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:43.130 align:middle line:10%
to consciousness.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.338 align:middle line:10%
Some people even say it's
beyond the reach of science

00:33:45.338 --> 00:33:46.160 align:middle line:10%
altogether.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.410 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the
last 25 years have

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:84%
seen an explosion of
scientific work in this area.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.380 align:middle line:84%
If you come to my lab at
the University of Sussex,

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.280 align:middle line:84%
you'll find scientists from
all different disciplines,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.890 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes even philosophers.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.620 align:middle line:84%
All of us together
trying to understand

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.180 align:middle line:84%
how consciousness
happens and what

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.002 align:middle line:90%
happens when it goes wrong.

00:34:07.002 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, there's
a neuroscientist, Sarah,

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.590 align:middle line:10%
who seems to get it.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.360 align:middle line:10%
He understands it.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.678 align:middle line:90%
I bet not a lot of them do.

00:34:14.678 --> 00:34:16.219 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I believe
that consciousness

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:17.639 align:middle line:90%
comes from energy.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
That energy, which I call God,
that flows through everything,

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.120 align:middle line:90%
holds--

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.630 align:middle line:90%
it holds all the information.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Again, God says, "I am
the Alpha and Omega."

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.860 align:middle line:90%
There is no beginning, no end.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the
amount of information

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.239 align:middle line:90%
that is held within energy.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.739 align:middle line:84%
So the more clear
that your body is

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.947 align:middle line:84%
and the more that you can
stream this energy through,

00:34:35.947 --> 00:34:38.510 align:middle line:84%
the more higher
consciousness one would be.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.465 align:middle line:10%
People who have very
toxic bodies and--

00:34:41.465 --> 00:34:43.590 align:middle line:10%
I believe they're tapping
into lower consciousness.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or negative people.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.938 align:middle line:10%
They're tapping into
lower consciousness,

00:34:46.938 --> 00:34:49.850 align:middle line:10%
and I believe always that
lower consciousness has

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:53.600 align:middle line:10%
lack of light, which will make
such things as energy vampires

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.790 align:middle line:10%
or what the suffering
we see in the world,

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.560 align:middle line:10%
and the abuse going
on, is the people who

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:10%
don't have that charge
of energy inside of them,

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.090 align:middle line:10%
and deficit are going
after the people who

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.215 align:middle line:10%
have that charge of energy.

00:35:03.215 --> 00:35:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:05.210 align:middle line:90%
This is my belief of that.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
increase your consciousness?

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.354 align:middle line:90%
How do you elevate it?

00:35:08.354 --> 00:35:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: With a
lot of techniques.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.330 align:middle line:90%
I believe in Atlantis.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:13.610 align:middle line:10%
You know, when it comes
to sound, per se--

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:16.400 align:middle line:10%
a person who's sick-- a
person who is depressed--

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.480 align:middle line:10%
their cells--

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.160 align:middle line:10%
each cell sends a--

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.230 align:middle line:10%
it has electrical
charge, and it sends

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:25.610 align:middle line:10%
to each other almost
like a electrical cord,

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:26.837 align:middle line:10%
and it passes throughout.

00:35:26.837 --> 00:35:28.670 align:middle line:10%
So I believe everybody
who's sick and stuff,

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.270 align:middle line:10%
they don't have that
charge passing properly,

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:10%
and they have lack
of that charge,

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.440 align:middle line:10%
and this makes the
cells slow down.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.200 align:middle line:84%
When the cells slow down,
that creates aging, sickness,

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and everything like that.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.609 align:middle line:84%
I believe in such
ancient cultures,

00:35:42.609 --> 00:35:44.150 align:middle line:84%
again, as Egypt and
stuff-- they knew

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.100 align:middle line:84%
how to instill light
energy into the body,

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.200 align:middle line:90%
and you read about them.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.099 align:middle line:84%
You know, in certain cultures
they lived thousands of years,

00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:52.640 align:middle line:84%
including the Bible,
if you remember.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that they knew
how to re-instill this energy

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.840 align:middle line:84%
inside of them, which created
them into higher consciousness,

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.790 align:middle line:84%
so they walked and
talked with God.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:06.530 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I believe that
a lot of fruits, vegetables,

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:10%
sort of sungazing--
and there's a lot

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.770 align:middle line:10%
of different ways of doing it.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe
there was what I

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.230 align:middle line:84%
call ancient light
technology, and that's

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.940 align:middle line:84%
something I do want
to talk about, too.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.842 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you come
across a psychic vampire?

00:36:19.842 --> 00:36:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Lots of
them in the world.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.120 align:middle line:10%
I believe that a lot
of people in society

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.310 align:middle line:10%
are and they don't
even know it, just

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:28.160 align:middle line:10%
because they're in
deficit of energy,

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.760 align:middle line:10%
and so this is creating
a lot of issues,

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.700 align:middle line:10%
because what seems
normal to everybody

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.690 align:middle line:10%
wasn't normal in these
ancient civilizations--

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:37.490 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:38.997 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: --to me, where I lived.

00:36:38.997 --> 00:36:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: Because they
seem like low charge--

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.110 align:middle line:84%
very low charge to
what I remember.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The way we're
going-- the path we're on--

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.242 align:middle line:84%
are you optimistic
about it, or concerned?

00:36:50.242 --> 00:36:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAMS: I'm very
optimistic about it.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I kind of have the
ability to see in the future,

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.550 align:middle line:90%
so--

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.394 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it look good?

00:36:59.394 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:10%
I have-- we see these pyramids,
we see the Easter Islands,

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.130 align:middle line:10%
the Stonehenge-- don't you
think that such advanced beings

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:13.180 align:middle line:10%
that created that would have a
plan for the world eventually?

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You would hope so.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.470 align:middle line:10%
A good plan.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.570 align:middle line:10%
>>ADAMS: All this ancient
technology is only

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.840 align:middle line:10%
lit up by energy, and
this ancient technology

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:10%
will be lit up.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.200 align:middle line:84%
As soon as humanity
lights themselves up,

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.739 align:middle line:84%
they will access this
ancient technology.

00:37:26.739 --> 00:37:29.030 align:middle line:10%
All the pyramids are aligned
to other pyramids on other

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:32.390 align:middle line:10%
planets, and isn't it
interesting-- the Bible--

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:35.960 align:middle line:10%
it says that-- talks about
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:10%
It says there's two angels.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.560 align:middle line:10%
Think about the two
Sphinx before the pyramid.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.360 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Yes.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.335 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sarah,
if you could wave

00:37:43.335 --> 00:37:45.650 align:middle line:84%
a magic wand over the
planet, what would

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that wish be that
everything happens?

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.550 align:middle line:90%
What would you want?

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: [LAUGHING] I--

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd wish that everybody
realized that God has never

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.910 align:middle line:90%
left humanity.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.680 align:middle line:84%
That God is within them and
it's been there all along.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Thank you.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really appreciate it.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.720 align:middle line:90%
You're very special.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.520 align:middle line:90%
You're different.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ADAMS: Thank you.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.523 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're different.

00:38:10.523 --> 00:38:13.130 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the magic
coming off her aura,

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and you could
probably end up doing

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.705 align:middle line:84%
