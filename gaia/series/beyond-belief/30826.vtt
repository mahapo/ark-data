00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:14.580 align:middle line:84%
>> [BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.129 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> People are basically going
to keep on to help uncover what

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:90%
really happened.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.779 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.445 align:middle line:84%
>> We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:24.445 --> 00:00:26.580 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NARRATOR: And now the host
of the nationally syndicated

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
"Coast to Coast AM" and Gaiam
TV bring you "Beyond Belief"

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:90%
with George Noory.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.113 align:middle line:84%
>> GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:42.113 --> 00:00:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and do we have a wonderful
program for you in store

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:90%
tonight.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.098 align:middle line:84%
You know, since I
was a little boy,

00:00:46.098 --> 00:00:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated
with the possibility

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:84%
that we were being visited
by extraterrestrials.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
That out in this universe,
this vast universe, there

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:84%
were planets with other
beings living on it.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:84%
I was just mesmerized
by these possibilities.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And our special guest tonight
had that same feeling.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a passion that has
driven him to seek out

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:84%
these questions--
are we being visited?

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Is there a life beyond
just planet Earth?

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
He's a former
nuclear physicist, I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
call him the Father
of Modern Day Ufology.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Ladies and gentleman, let's
welcome Stanton Friedman.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.810 align:middle line:90%
Stan.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:90%
How are you, my friend?

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Stan Friedman, back in 1971, was
my very first radio interview

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:84%
My news director at the time,
John Webster, great guy,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:84%
I said, John, I want
to go cover this guy.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
He's coming in to
talk to some engineers

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to talk
at a college about UFOs.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And John said, no,
George, come on.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.300 align:middle line:84%
We want hard news,
murders, fires.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, I'm going.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So I went on my own, and it
was the greatest interview

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:90%
I ever did back in 1971.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And Stanton still remains
a great guest to this day.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Where did this passion
come from, my friend?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:84%
>> STANTON FRIEDMAN: It
goes with the territory.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I worked on far out stuff
only, nuclear rockets,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
nuclear airplanes, nuclear
powered planes for space,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:90%
stuff like that.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And I found that I
had a passion for it.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:84%
I read science fiction when I
was a kid and gave up on it,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.854 align:middle line:84%
the science was much
more interesting.

00:02:22.854 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And when I found that people
were interested in what

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I had to say and would turn
out in droves and stuff,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:90%
I was hooked.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:90%
I like being on the stage.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Leo, you know,
one of those guys.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.055 align:middle line:84%
Me and Benito Mussolini born on
July 29, Peter Jennings, too.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was,
it gave me a chance

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:84%
to put together the crazy
aspects of my background.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Working under security for
14 years, that was one thing.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.462 align:middle line:84%
Working on far out
propulsion systems.

00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: One of
the big arguments is,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:90%
you can't get here from there.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
That's from the nasty, noisy
negativists, as I call them.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that drove
me was this business

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:90%
of keeping secrets.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
The public is simply not
aware of how many secrets

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:84%
are being kept, how much money
is being spent on black budget

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
entitled to know that.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And then there's all
the implications.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Where do we go from
here if we're not alone?

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And I like to take
people down a peg,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:84%
when they're beyond what
they were able to do.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.507 align:middle line:84%
And all the people who say
there's nothing to UFOs,

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
you can't get here from there,
governments can't keep secrets,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
all this stupid stuff-- I
enjoy being able to show,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.590 align:middle line:84%
here are the facts,
here's the data.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And I abide by one
rule, George, you

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't open your
mouth as a scientist

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:90%
until you have data in hand.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not a
commonly practiced rule.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.599 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks
everybody is entitled

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:90%
to an opinion about everything.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And people say, you must
get a hard time, George.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Or to me they say.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And I say look, over 700
lectures I've had 11 hecklers,

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.836 align:middle line:90%
and two of them were drunk.

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm told you'll get
more than that if you

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.630 align:middle line:84%
talk about sports,
religion, politics.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.046 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
talk about things.

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And of those nine
hecklers, how many were plants?

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: I don't know.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.837 align:middle line:84%
But the audience
took care of them.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: I worried the first
year I spoke that somebody is

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
going to want to know something
I know nothing about and make

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:90%
me look like a damn fool.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I haven't worried
since that first year.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And also I find that
audiences are really decent.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.360 align:middle line:90%
They give you a chance.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I had a guy interrupt
me three times

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and somebody in
the audience says,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.480 align:middle line:84%
we came here to
here Mr. Friedman.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:84%
If you could have seen
the look on his face.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
He thought everybody
was with him.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.316 align:middle line:90%
They weren't.

00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.248 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: So I don't
worry about it anymore.

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:90%
I enjoy myself.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's forced me to
think about a lot of things

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that, as a nuclear
physicist, I probably

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have thought of.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.907 align:middle line:84%
Motivation of people-- why
would aliens come to this place?

00:04:53.907 --> 00:04:56.365 align:middle line:84%
They didn't come here to be on
your show, as far as I know.

00:04:56.365 --> 00:04:56.657 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:04:56.657 --> 00:04:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.945 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Not yet.

00:04:57.945 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'll see what
I can do, George.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: But it has
forced me to think about a lot

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:84%
of things that I otherwise
wouldn't have thought about.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:90%
So it's been a ball.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.822 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I gave my
first lecture in '67.

00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a long time ago.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.946 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It is a long time.

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:15.004 align:middle line:84%
I met you '71, four
years after that.

00:05:15.004 --> 00:05:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah,
but, of course,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
you were a young guy
and I'm an old guy.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah,
but you know what?

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:90%
You look the same.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.725 align:middle line:90%
You have not changed since 1971.

00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:90%
You're ageless.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.683 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: The hair is grayer.

00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:27.107 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm beginning to
wonder if you're not an alien.

00:05:27.107 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, I
live in Canada, George.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Will that do?

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, in 1970, there
was a tremendous interest

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:90%
in UFOs.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.062 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that's
still the case now?

00:05:38.062 --> 00:05:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah, It's a
different kind of interest.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.472 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
internet, people don't

00:05:42.472 --> 00:05:44.430 align:middle line:84%
need to admit publicly
that they're interested.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:84%
They can go at home,
on the internet.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: They do their thing.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.631 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:05:47.631 --> 00:05:49.826 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: But I
still get great crowds.

00:05:49.826 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not bragging
there, I'm just saying

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
that people turn out
for the programs.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And what-- I'm in Roswell
just about every year,

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.926 align:middle line:84%
because I'm the original
civilian investigator

00:05:57.926 --> 00:05:59.060 align:middle line:90%
of the Roswell incident.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:84%
They're turning out
there by the thousands.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So I know that the
interest is there.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I still do a lot
of radio interviews

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:84%
where I don't, even for your
show, I mean 2:00 to 6:00

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.604 align:middle line:84%
in the morning where I live
is not my best time of day.

00:06:12.604 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But you
still have the energy.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: But I
do have the energy.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I can do it in
my pajamas and bathrobe,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of nice.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:90%
This is not a bathrobe.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.315 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Stan did a debate
with Seth Shostak from SETI.

00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about that
later on in the program, where

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:84%
you annihilated him, based
on the public vote on that.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.422 align:middle line:84%
But this belief system in
UFOs is still strong now.

00:06:33.422 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah,
people are interested.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.963 align:middle line:84%
There are more believers
than non-believers.

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
People think I must get a
hard time wherever I go.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.294 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I find that people
are interested.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And when they know
what my viewpoint is,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:90%
they're not afraid to talk.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Look, at the end of most of
my lectures, George, some

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:84%
to as many as 2,000 people,
I will ask my audiences.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.619 align:middle line:90%
I say, I get the first question.

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:56.160 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
believe that you have

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
seen what I would consider
to be a flying saucer?

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I've defined my terms earlier.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Just raise your
hand and I just want to point

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and count.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:90%
And so the hands go up.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Each one afraid this
he's the only one.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:90%
And I go, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.750 align:middle line:84%
By the time I get
over here, the hands

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.500 align:middle line:84%
go up vigorously,
because they realize

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.583 align:middle line:90%
they're not the only ones.

00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:18.209 align:middle line:84%
Typically, it's
10% of the crowd,

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:19.250 align:middle line:90%
which is a lot of people.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That is
a lot of people.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: And then I ask, how
many of you reported what you

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:90%
saw?

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:90%
90% of the hands go down.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.389 align:middle line:84%
And I ask, if there's still
people left, I'll say,

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
how many of you were in
the military at the time?

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And if there's still
some people I'll say,

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:90%
do want to tell us about it?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Get some great responses.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
One guy, in front of 1,300
people said, I can't.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:84%
They told me not
to say anything.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.762 align:middle line:84%
Another guy, in Indianapolis
said, they took my pictures.

00:07:43.762 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
You want the rest of
the story, you know.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:90%
And he's sitting there.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And I say, look, you
don't need to stand up.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not asking your name.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.980 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure the
audience would like

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:90%
to hear the rest of the story.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.141 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was in the military.

00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:90%
He had had a sighting.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.670 align:middle line:90%
And they he had pictures.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They
confiscated his pictures.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.283 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: So I
said, tell us about.

00:07:56.283 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's flying a four engine
aircraft over the Pacific.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.952 align:middle line:84%
Get a call from a
plane 20 miles ahead.

00:08:00.952 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a saucer
heading their way.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.285 align:middle line:90%
They had gun cameras.

00:08:03.285 --> 00:08:04.264 align:middle line:90%
They took pictures.

00:08:04.264 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They called the base to
which they were going.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.780 align:middle line:90%
They don't handle the film.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Pilots don't take film to the
drug store to get it looked at,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:10.907 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You just hand it over.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.535 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: It gets taken.

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: And they got
debriefed and told never to say

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.187 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:08:17.187 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure everybody in the
audience believed the guy.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:90%
He was obviously sincere.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know I was going to go
through this routine and stuff.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:90%
So I have a big feedback loop.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere I go people
have had sightings

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:90%
that they haven't reported.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Did the same thing
happened with Gordon Cooper,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
the former astronaut,
the late astronaut?

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.210 align:middle line:90%
He saw a series of UFOs.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:90%
They took pictures.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:90%
And they confiscated them.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah, that's
when he was in California.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.894 align:middle line:84%
He also had a sighting when
he was flying in Europe.

00:08:48.894 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't get as high
as the saucer went.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:90%
A bunch of them were up.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.104 align:middle line:84%
And so, what do you do
with guys like that?

00:08:55.104 --> 00:08:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you say you
don't believe them?

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're only an
astronaut, after all.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:58.975 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:58.975 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: I was very pleased
that the forward to my book,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:84%
"Flying Saucers and Science"
was written by the sixth man

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.490 align:middle line:90%
to walk on the moon.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was a vote of
approval, if you will.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
The science, one of the things
that got me really going,

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:84%
George, was when I started to
talk to professional groups.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was their
enthusiastic response.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.175 align:middle line:90%
I was still a young guy then.

00:09:28.175 --> 00:09:29.800 align:middle line:84%
When the Engineering
Society of Detroit

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:84%
is sold out three
weeks in advance

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.989 align:middle line:84%
for 1,008 people for
dinner and a talk,

00:09:33.989 --> 00:09:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and there are no
negative questions--

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.337 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Exactly.

00:09:36.337 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: --that reaches you.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I can't say those people
don't know anything.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Why should I pay attention?

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to so
many professional groups,

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:84%
engineering societies,
sections of the American

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos Lab had
500 people there

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
to a meeting of the local
American Nuclear Society

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:90%
chapter.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.080 align:middle line:90%
No negative questions.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:90%
I have to respect that.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying something
to a lot of people

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.411 align:middle line:90%
want to hear, apparently.

00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's huge.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.813 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: For me it has been.

00:10:03.813 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, my ego is,
yeah, I'm the Leo

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:90%
who likes being on the stage.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:13.835 align:middle line:84%
But I do feel that I'm filling
a public service, George.

00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm educating.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm stimulating.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And the usual
response, when people

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:84%
ask me the why questions,
why would aliens come here?

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Why don't they land on
the White House lawn?

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
The usual response
is, oh I hadn't

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:90%
thought of it that way before.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the
response I want.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I want people to
do some thinking.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a subject that
requires a lot of thought.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It sure does.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Mitchell.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Edgar
Mitchell, yes.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Your friend.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yes.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Great astronaut, a
believer in extraterrestrial

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.650 align:middle line:84%
He has told you, he
has told me that he

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
has been told by higher ups that
this planet is being visited.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.514 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yes.

00:10:55.514 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You were one of the
first to unravel the Roswell

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:58.746 align:middle line:90%
story of 1947.

00:10:58.746 --> 00:11:01.226 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell us a little
bit about what happened there,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Stan.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, I can
tell you what happened there,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:84%
based on the testimony
of the people I talked

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.290 align:middle line:84%
to, and the newspaper articles,
and all that sort of stuff.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.722 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, a saucer
exploded in midair

00:11:15.722 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:90%
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico has a lot
of nowhere, George.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A lot of nowhere.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: And a rancher
discovered wreckage.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.391 align:middle line:84%
His sheep wouldn't cross the
wreckage, the debris field.

00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what worried him.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's smart.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.553 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: They got to
go to where the water is,

00:11:31.553 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and it gets pretty
hot in New Mexico.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So he goes into the
little town of Corona.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.670 align:middle line:84%
He's telling the guys at the
bar there, it's a general store,

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:90%
everybody knows everybody.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:84%
He hadn't heard anything
about flying saucers.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:90%
The people there had.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have a radio,
didn't have electricity.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling them about
this wreckage over his land.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.696 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
well, you know

00:11:56.696 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:84%
they're offering a reward
for money for wreckage

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
from one of these
flying saucers.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That was a surprise.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.036 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That was it.

00:12:04.036 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Bingo.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: So
he, the next day,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:84%
drove into Roswell and with
some of the wreckage went

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:84%
to the Sheriff's office
looking for the reward.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.980 align:middle line:90%
And the Sheriff called the base.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.210 align:middle line:84%
The base was the most unique
military group in the world.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It was home of the only
atomic bombers, the 509s.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:84%
They dropped the bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't a bunch of
guys who had nothing to do

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:90%
but make up stories, you know.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And so the Sheriff,
by pre-arrangement,

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
called the base,
Roswell Army Airfield,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
talked to the base intelligence
officer, Major Jesse Marcel.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:84%
He says, there's a
rancher here who's

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
got some weird stuff
that he brought in here.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And Major Marcel talks to
the boss, Colonel Blanchard.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:90%
He says, go check it out.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:90%
He does.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.044 align:middle line:90%
He looks at this stuff.

00:12:52.044 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I was the first
guy to talk to him

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.394 align:middle line:84%
in even 1978, all
those years later.

00:12:56.394 --> 00:12:58.185 align:middle line:84%
He says, there wasn't
anything conventional

00:12:58.185 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:90%
in what he brought in there.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:90%
He talks to the colonel.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.690 align:middle line:84%
The colonel says, take one of
our Counter Intelligence Corps

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:90%
guys with you.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:90%
He was worried about spies.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Because of all the classified
work going on in New Mexico.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It's where we were
testing the rockets.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.001 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:13:12.001 --> 00:13:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And they had no idea what
this was at the time.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: No, no idea.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So they followed the
rancher out to his place.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
No way to tell
anybody because it's

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.947 align:middle line:90%
out in the middle of nowhere.

00:13:20.947 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:84%
They spend overnight
in their sleeping bags.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:84%
The next day, they
see the debris field.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Area many hundreds of
yards long, 100 yards wide,

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.045 align:middle line:84%
strewn with pieces of
small strange stuff.

00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Nothing conventional.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Was
there anything big?

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: No.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:90%
No, that was the thing.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: This thing just, like
it was exploded or something.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, that's what
Jesse told me in our first

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:40.471 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:42.110 align:middle line:84%
It had to have
exploded up above.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Because he had
seen plane crashes.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.354 align:middle line:84%
When an airplane
goes in, it makes

00:13:45.354 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:90%
of a big hole in the ground.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.478 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:13:47.478 --> 00:13:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: And it
doesn't cover a huge area.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.350 align:middle line:84%
This stuff, this thing had
to explode above the ground

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:90%
and covered a huge area.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So they brought back some
of the stuff to town.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
He did stop at his home
on the way to the base,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.040 align:middle line:84%
showed is 11-year-old
son, who was

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:84%
a colonel from the military--
became one, not at 11.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
A medical doctor,
flight surgeon.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And a believer?

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.956 align:middle line:84%
He handled pieces
of the wreckage.

00:14:13.956 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, an only child.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:90%
His dad brings this stuff in.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Next day at the
base, the colonel

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
tells Jesse, get one of
our B-29s to take you

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and this stuff to our
headquarters in Fort Worth,

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Texas on your way to Wright
Patterson Air Force Base,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:84%
which is where captured enemy
equipment goes, anything

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:90%
strange.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:36.568 align:middle line:84%
If a Russian airplane
crashed on American soil,

00:14:36.568 --> 00:14:38.800 align:middle line:90%
it would go to Wright Patterson.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:90%
And everybody follows orders.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
He tells the base public
information officer, Walter

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.679 align:middle line:84%
Haut, put out a
press release saying

00:14:45.679 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:84%
we have now recovered one
of these flying saucers

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.928 align:middle line:90%
that people have been seeing.

00:14:48.928 --> 00:14:51.430 align:middle line:84%
The first big sighting
was two weeks earlier,

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Kenneth Arnold sighting,
up in a Pacific Northwest.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:90%
So everybody follows orders.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Jesse gets to Fort Worth, Texas.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:84%
General Ramey, Colonel
Blanchard's boss,

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:84%
the head of the 8th Air
Force-- you don't say anything,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:90%
he says.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.920 align:middle line:90%
I'll take care of it.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
He brings in the wreckage of
a radar reflector, weather

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.600 align:middle line:90%
balloon combination.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Tells the press-- everybody is
going crazy, because you know.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Oh, they're
going nuts, yeah.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.481 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: This is the
culmination of two weeks

00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:23.154 align:middle line:84%
of weird stuff, sightings in
40 some states, et cetera.

00:15:23.154 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Just a radar reflector,
weather balloon,

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:90%
nothing to worry about.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
The evening papers for that day
July 8, 1947, had the story.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.060 align:middle line:84%
The West Coast papers
had both stories.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:84%
General Says it's
Radar Weather Gadget.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning, Ramey
Empties Roswell Saucer.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:90%
And that was the end of that.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason, it's important
to realize that Blanchard sent

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:84%
a Counter Intelligence
Corps guy with him,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.504 align:middle line:90%
he was worried about spies.

00:15:49.504 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:84%
As it happens, we know
the Russians had spies.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.795 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And again, they had
no idea what it was, right?

00:15:53.795 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: No.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And even when they realized
it was something different,

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.089 align:middle line:84%
people say, why didn't they
just go public with it?

00:15:59.089 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:90%
This is 1947.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
The war has only been
over for two years.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.769 align:middle line:84%
The Marshall Plan
was just starting.

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:06.449 align:middle line:90%
Half of Europe was starving.

00:16:06.449 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
You're going to say,
well, we thought

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.515 align:middle line:84%
you would like to
know that there

00:16:09.515 --> 00:16:10.807 align:middle line:90%
are alien invaders coming here.

00:16:10.807 --> 00:16:12.848 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where they're
from, what they want,

00:16:12.848 --> 00:16:13.560 align:middle line:90%
how they operate.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if they're
working with anybody here.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
But what the heck, you can
handle that, can't you?

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: "War of the Worlds"
happened 10 years before that.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:21.740 align:middle line:90%
People were panicking.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.198 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: They
couldn't do that.

00:16:23.198 --> 00:16:26.504 align:middle line:84%
And they also, obvious question,
how do the darn things work?

00:16:26.504 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be great if
we could build things?

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the sightings
already indicated

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.064 align:middle line:84%
these things were
highly maneuverable.

00:16:33.064 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Just what you would
want in an airplane.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.188 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Stan, I want to talk
with you about the occupants

00:16:37.188 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:84%
of these craft when we get our
audience, here, to participate,

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.870 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take some questions
for Stanton Friedman.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get more into this
incredible story of Roswell.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Who's got a question about
extraterrestrial visitations

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:90%
or UFOs?

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Have you heard
about the sightings in Denver?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.019 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything to
it, to your knowledge?

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, I'll
tell you one thing.

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:84%
There are far more sightings
than most people believe.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.579 align:middle line:84%
The Mutual UFO Network, which
used to be headquartered here

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
in Colorado, incidentally,
gets over 600 reports a month

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:90%
of sightings.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't heard about
anything in particular,

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.818 align:middle line:84%
but it wouldn't surprise
me if everywhere I

00:17:15.818 --> 00:17:17.359 align:middle line:84%
go people can tell
me there have been

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.734 align:middle line:84%
sightings in the
last few months.

00:17:18.734 --> 00:17:20.275 align:middle line:84%
I get some people
say, how come there

00:17:20.275 --> 00:17:21.950 align:middle line:84%
haven't been any
sightings this year?

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:84%
600 a month is a
lot of sightings.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That is
a lot of sightings.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: I don't
have an answer for you.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:26.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Stan, isn't this also
where the Condon Report came

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:90%
out?

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: University
of Colorado, Boulder.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Knocking down
Project Blue Book and the UFOs.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, Dr. Condon,
he was a fine scientist,

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.850 align:middle line:84%
said a lot of stupid
things in his report.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.657 align:middle line:84%
Didn't take the
subject seriously.

00:17:43.657 --> 00:17:46.240 align:middle line:84%
He had already made up is mind,
if you look at the comments he

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:84%
made during the year-long
course of the story,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:90%
he had already made up his mind.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Chances are 1 in 10,000
anybody could get here.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Nobody will be coming
here for 10,000 years.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.095 align:middle line:90%
No basis given for these.

00:18:00.095 --> 00:18:04.230 align:middle line:84%
He was old school,
and that was it.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Don't bother me with-- there are
four basic rules for debunkers,

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.960 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Don't bother me with the
facts, my mind's made up.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.260 align:middle line:84%
What the public doesn't know,
I'm not going to tell them.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.830 align:middle line:84%
If you can't attack the data,
attack to people, it's easier.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And do your research
by proclamation.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to say
there is no evidence.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.662 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to do
anything to back that up.

00:18:23.662 --> 00:18:25.120 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
provide anything,

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.390 align:middle line:84%
because there isn't
anything to provide.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Those are all nonsense, frankly.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Let's take another
question for Stan Friedman.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.817 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, what's
your definition of a UFO?

00:18:34.817 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Got to be a
little careful with that.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.630 align:middle line:84%
My lectures were normally
flying saucers are real,

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
because I'm interested in
flying saucers, not in UFOs.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
All flying saucer's
are UFOs, very few UFOs

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.380 align:middle line:90%
are flying saucers.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.062 align:middle line:84%
So something that's unidentified
to the observer is a UFO.

00:18:51.062 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:84%
What I'm interested
in are the ones

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that remain unidentified
after investigation

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:90%
by competent investigators.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I do in my
lecture, it's a little sneaky,

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.775 align:middle line:84%
I talk about five large scale
scientific studies, show slides

00:19:05.775 --> 00:19:06.275 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:19:06.275 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask, how many
people here have read this?

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm lucky if it's 2%
who have read any of them.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So I know that people haven't
looked at the evidence.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's never the nasty, noisy
negativists who have read them.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.102 align:middle line:84%
So yes, most sightings
can be explained.

00:19:22.102 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
That's about as useful as
saying most isotopes aren't

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:90%
fissionable.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And most people aren't
seven feet tall.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Tell that to the
basketball coach.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know, maybe 1 in 1,000.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:31.690 align:middle line:90%
Give me that guy.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about the
midgets of the world.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So yes, most sightings
can be explained.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
The biggest study
ever done, 21 and 1/2%

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:84%
of 3,200 cases-- this was
done for the United States Air

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Force-- 21 and 1/2%
could not be explained,

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.890 align:middle line:84%
completely separate
from the ones

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
that were listed as
insufficient information.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the common excuse
from the debunkers.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, there just
wasn't enough data.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.930 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:84%
There is a separate
category for them.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So I try to get
rid of the myths.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, most sightings
can be explained.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.630 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:84%
It's irrelevant to
the question at hand.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Every large-scale
scientific study

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:84%
finds a substantial number--
well, the University

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:84%
of Colorado, as
a matter of fact.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.340 align:middle line:84%
A special UFO subcommittee
of the world's largest group

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.131 align:middle line:84%
of space scientists,
the American Institute

00:20:19.131 --> 00:20:23.350 align:middle line:84%
of Aeronautics and
Astronautics, 30%, they said,

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.560 align:middle line:84%
any phenomena with 30%
unknown is certainly worth

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.250 align:middle line:90%
investigating.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:84%
They said that 30% of 117
cases looked at by the Condon

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Committee could
not be explained.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can say, oh,
well they identified

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.220 align:middle line:90%
70%, that's good enough.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.454 align:middle line:90%
No, it isn't.

00:20:39.454 --> 00:20:42.419 align:middle line:90%
No, it isn't.

00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Even if one case
couldn't be explained, Stan,

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:45.820 align:middle line:90%
it would be worth it.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Back to
Roswell for a moment.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the occupants.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, I
didn't see any of them.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:84%
The reports we have, and there
are occupant reports from all

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:84%
over the world, let's face
it, in the abduction cases.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:84%
In the physical trace cases,
most people aren't aware,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Ted Phillips has
collected 4,000 of these cases

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:90%
from 80 countries.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Where people see the saucer
on or near the ground,

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and after it leaves, one
finds physical changes.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.620 align:middle line:84%
The equivalent of burn circles,
burn rings, landing gear marks.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:84%
1/6 of those cases
involve reports

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.537 align:middle line:84%
of beings associated
with the craft.

00:21:21.537 --> 00:21:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Either walking around.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Walking
around, picking up plants,

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:90%
digging up soil, whatever.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we can say
about the occupants,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and if you look at the
abduction cases as well,

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be shorter than
we are to be humanoid in form.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:84%
That is two arms, two legs,
a head, and a body, two eyes.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear reports of beings
with three arms, or five eyes,

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.380 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying everybody
out there is humanoid.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying the guys
who are coming here.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.574 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the ammonia
breathers go someplace

00:21:57.574 --> 00:21:58.990 align:middle line:84%
when they're picking
up specimens.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Could they be robots?

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, they might
be cyborgs, more likely.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.086 align:middle line:90%
That is a combination of--

00:22:05.086 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Biological.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Biological
and mechanical, yeah.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:90%
Look we're getting that.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We're getting there.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah, you
know, artificial limbs,

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.439 align:middle line:84%
people who run in races
that don't have any legs

00:22:16.439 --> 00:22:16.980 align:middle line:90%
of their own.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.146 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I've got a friend
who's got a pig's valve.

00:22:19.146 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I've got another friend who's
got a plastic aorta put in.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:90%
That's mechanical.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Sure.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So the point is that,
they seem to be enough

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:84%
like us to say that they're
not going to scare you out

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
of your wits because
they're terrible.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.610 align:middle line:84%
The movies have gone
a little bit overboard

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:90%
with some of that stuff.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.182 align:middle line:84%
The occupants, if you take the
Betty and Barney Hill case.

00:22:41.182 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: That was in New
Hampshire back in the '60s.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: New
Hampshire, 1961.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
The beings, well, there
were two different types,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:48.800 align:middle line:90%
there seemed to be.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
There were bigger
guys and littler guys.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:57.970 align:middle line:84%
The small grays, maybe 4 foot
tall, big heads, dark eyes,

00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.450 align:middle line:90%
skinny little guys.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.017 align:middle line:84%
They got good diet
control out there.

00:23:01.017 --> 00:23:02.475 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they can't
carry enough food.

00:23:02.475 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what?

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But they're not science
fiction monsters.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's an
earthling look like?

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously,
he has to have hair

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:90%
on his face, right, George?

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.386 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, some of
them don't even have hair

00:23:15.386 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:90%
on their heads, you know.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.436 align:middle line:90%
And the color of the skin.

00:23:18.436 --> 00:23:20.060 align:middle line:84%
People say, why would
aliens come here?

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And I give them a
whole bunch of reasons.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.550 align:middle line:84%
I say, maybe it's the only
place in the neighborhood where

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:90%
people have different color.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's right.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: And speak all
these different languages.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's weird.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.837 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm saying this was
a penal colony at one time.

00:23:31.837 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:84%
They dumped all the bad
boys and girls here.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
so nasty to each other.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You might
be right about that.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.195 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well,
I've been to Australia.

00:23:37.195 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And down there,
they're very proud

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle line:90%
of their convict heritage.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.060 align:middle line:84%
That surprised me,
but, of course, these

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.514 align:middle line:84%
were decent people who got in
debtor's prison, most of them.

00:23:46.514 --> 00:23:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Right.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: But the
point is, we don't know.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But what's really happening
now, George, and I'm

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:84%
giving a paper in a few weeks
about a new look at the cosmos.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.909 align:middle line:84%
Our understanding of our
role, we earthlings--

00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I think they're all
earthlings out there, George.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:03.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.176 align:middle line:84%
You didn't take IDs
when they came in.

00:24:05.176 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could be one or two
ETs could be in this group.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Our perception
of where we fit in the scheme

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:90%
of things should change.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:84%
We used to think we're
in the top of the heap.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.870 align:middle line:84%
This the only solar system
in the whole universe.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do is the first
time it's ever been done

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and the best, and all
this kind of stuff.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Now we realize, A, that there
are loads of planets out there.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
We're talking billions,
here, not just a few.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:84%
We recognize that
gee, the Earth's

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.110 align:middle line:84%
been around for 4 plus billion
years, and the universe maybe

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:90%
10 billion years.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:42.800 align:middle line:84%
How can we imagine that with,
what, 120 years of technology--

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
pick a number, it
doesn't matter,

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
it's a short period
of time compared

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
to the lifespan of
a neighborhood--

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle line:84%
that we could be
the most advanced?

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
the rate of change

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:84%
of our knowledge
in my life span.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, since 1900, the
nuclear world, the flight

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.357 align:middle line:84%
world, the electronics
world, lasers, you name it.

00:25:02.357 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Huge difference.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Biology,
it's all gone sky high.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Now are we to believe that
nobody got started out there

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
before we did on
any of these things?

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.950 align:middle line:84%
That's an incredibly
arrogant belief system.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And some of them had
billions of years ahead of us.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
people say, well,

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.794 align:middle line:84%
why don't they land on
the White House lawn?

00:25:26.794 --> 00:25:28.335 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those
stupid questions.

00:25:28.335 --> 00:25:30.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, the President--
I'm sure you're all aware

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.395 align:middle line:84%
that the President
of the United States

00:25:32.395 --> 00:25:34.610 align:middle line:84%
does not speak for 7
billion earthlings.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:39.000 align:middle line:84%
He has trouble sleeping for 310
million Americans sometimes.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
why do people travel?

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not to have tea at the
White House, for most people.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:90%
And let me cut to the chase.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Why would anybody
come here anyway?

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
I make one assumption about
every advanced civilization.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:84%
It's concerned about its
own survival and security.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.665 align:middle line:90%
If it's not, it won't last.

00:26:00.665 --> 00:26:02.660 align:middle line:84%
That being the case,
you have to keep tabs

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.777 align:middle line:84%
on the primitives
in the neighborhood.

00:26:04.777 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But only close tabs on
those primitives that

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.390 align:middle line:84%
show signs of being
able to bother you.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:84%
At the end of World War
II, there were three signs

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that soon these
idiot earthlings--

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I say that because we killed
50 million of our own kind

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:84%
in World War II, 50 million,
we destroyed 1,700 cities, not

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.602 align:middle line:84%
nice guys here-- but
three signs that soon

00:26:27.602 --> 00:26:31.230 align:middle line:84%
we would be able to take our
brand of friendship out there.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear weapons,
powerful radar, which

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:39.040 align:middle line:84%
was the beginning of the
electronics revolution,

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.090 align:middle line:84%
if you will, and powerful
rockets, the V2s,

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:84%
which were being
used to kill people.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it interesting
that in July 1947,

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:84%
the only place on the whole
planet where you could study

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:84%
all three of those was
Southeastern New Mexico.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.660 align:middle line:84%
First atomic bomb, Trinity
site, I've been there,

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.680 align:middle line:84%
on the grounds of the
White Sands Missile Range.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:84%
That's where we had our best
radar to track the rockets that

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:90%
were also being tracked there.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say, but
sometimes the rockets

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.300 align:middle line:90%
went south instead of north.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Mexicans weren't very
happy about that,

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:84%
even though they didn't
have warheads on them.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.030 align:middle line:90%
So you had all three things.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's where Roswell is,
in case you're interested.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.842 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How coincidental.

00:27:21.842 --> 00:27:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Of which, I don't
believe in coincidence.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.883 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: No, I don't
believe in coincidences either.

00:27:25.883 --> 00:27:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying here
is, in one of my papers

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I list 20 reasons
for coming here.

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:90%
They get a weekly show, George.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Idiocy in the boondocks on radio
out on Zeta Reticuli, you know.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.082 align:middle line:84%
But they may be stealing
goodies from here.

00:27:41.082 --> 00:27:42.790 align:middle line:84%
We're the only planet
in the solar system

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.240 align:middle line:90%
covered with water, almost 3/4.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:84%
We are the densest planet
in the solar system.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.397 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean the people.

00:27:49.397 --> 00:27:50.480 align:middle line:90%
That's probably true, too.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But a cubic foot of Earth
weighs more than a cubic foot

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.269 align:middle line:90%
of any of the other planets.

00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, any of the other planets.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:90%
And you say, so what?

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Well there's certain metals
that are very dense metals, that

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.510 align:middle line:84%
are going to be more here
than any other planets-- gold,

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
uranium, tungsten,
rhenium, osmium, platinum.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:90%
You think heavy is lead?

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Rhenium is twice
as dense as lead.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.809 align:middle line:84%
These have very
special properties,

00:28:16.809 --> 00:28:18.600 align:middle line:84%
so they may have been
stealing the goodies.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.641 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, gold, what's
the price of gold now?

00:28:20.641 --> 00:28:21.308 align:middle line:90%
$16.50 an ounce?

00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's huge.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.760 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Something
ridiculous like that.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They think
it could go to $5,000.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.405 align:middle line:84%
You could afford to give a
little space to some gold,

00:28:29.405 --> 00:28:31.280 align:middle line:84%
if you have a rocket,
you know, to come here.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But what about the
creatures on this planet, Stan?

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, would they
find the creatures

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:38.757 align:middle line:84%
here so vast that it
would intrigue them?

00:28:38.757 --> 00:28:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: I think it's their
activities that would intrigue

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they may be
doing hybridization.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.729 align:middle line:84%
They may be stealing
genetic material.

00:28:47.729 --> 00:28:49.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, we sometimes
forget, if you

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:53.720 align:middle line:84%
got a herd of prize cattle, they
may all have the same father.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But humans are differentiated
all over the place.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.591 align:middle line:84%
Only 1 in 10,000 has
hemophilia, for example.

00:28:59.591 --> 00:29:01.090 align:middle line:84%
You got to gather
a lot of specimens

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:84%
to check out these
oddball genetic stuff.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:84%
But I think one
reason, if I were

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.730 align:middle line:84%
to say one word that I think
is most likely for the reason

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.620 align:middle line:84%
for being here, is
to quarantine us.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.680 align:middle line:90%
If you were an alien.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you would
want us out there.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.075 align:middle line:90%
We're not nice guys.

00:29:19.075 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize that
this year, we earthlings

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:84%
will spend $1 trillion
on things military,

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.080 align:middle line:84%
while thousands of
children die needlessly

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
of preventable disease
and starvation every day.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:90%
How do we look to them?

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't want us out there.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to the
obvious next question.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, but we're not
a threat to them.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.130 align:middle line:84%
That's where my having worked
on far out propulsion systems

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:90%
comes into the picture.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Can you get to the stars?

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Not with a dumb old
chemical rocket.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:57.617 align:middle line:90%
How about fusion rockets?

00:29:57.617 --> 00:29:58.950 align:middle line:90%
There's an interesting sequence.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:02.822 align:middle line:84%
In 1944, a big bomb was
a 10 ton blockbuster,

00:30:02.822 --> 00:30:04.030 align:middle line:90%
that's what they were called.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:05.985 align:middle line:84%
It took a pretty good
size B-29 to carry it.

00:30:05.985 --> 00:30:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And we dropped a lot
of them in Europe,

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.276 align:middle line:84%
and they make a nice
hole in the ground.

00:30:09.276 --> 00:30:11.650 align:middle line:90%
10 tons of TNT, you might say.

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:90%
OK first, that was 1944.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.920 align:middle line:84%
In 1945, the first
atom bomb released

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:21.560 align:middle line:84%
the energy of
18,000 tons of TNT.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.260 align:middle line:90%
'45.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Seven years later, our first
fusion device, an H-bomb,

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:32.410 align:middle line:90%
10 million tons of TNT.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:36.150 align:middle line:84%
That's an enormous leap
in a short period of time.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I worked on a study of fusion
propulsion for deep space

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:84%
travel, George, in the early
'60s, for goodness sakes.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And explain what
that is, fusion propulsion.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, here's
the interesting thing.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Everybody out there,
everywhere, is

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:84%
going to be concerned about
fusion, because that's

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
the energy process
of all the stars.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:58.650 align:middle line:84%
These are nuclear reactions
that produce an enormous amount

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.290 align:middle line:84%
of energy when the
conditions are right.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.042 align:middle line:84%
That's why H-bombs, 10
million tons of TNT.

00:31:04.042 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, the
Russians exploded

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:84%
one that was 57 million tons of
TNT energy released equivalent.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:13.916 align:middle line:84%
So everybody out there
knows that fusion

00:31:13.916 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:84%
is the main source of
energy in the universe.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.400 align:middle line:90%
That's how the stars work.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:84%
They also know that if
you're smart and want

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.860 align:middle line:84%
to spend a lot of money, you can
build a nuclear fusion rocket

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and kick particles out the
back end 10 million times

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.620 align:middle line:84%
as much energy per
particle as they

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.170 align:middle line:84%
can get in a dumb
old chemical rocket.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.800 align:middle line:90%
We know how to get to the stars.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.467 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it will take a big budget.

00:31:38.467 --> 00:31:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Look how much money it took to
build the first fission device,

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:42.404 align:middle line:90%
an atomic bomb.

00:31:42.404 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And you know what's
funny, George.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:84%
The Navy, not the
Air Force, the Navy

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:50.939 align:middle line:84%
has pioneered in
using nuclear energy.

00:31:50.939 --> 00:31:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Nuclear submarines.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:52.813 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Subs everywhere.

00:31:52.813 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: First
one 1956, "Nautilus."

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:84%
We now have aircraft
carriers, nuclear powered,

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:08.752 align:middle line:84%
that can operate for more than
18 years without refueling.

00:32:08.752 --> 00:32:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Isn't that amazing?

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.251 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: That's incredible.

00:32:11.251 --> 00:32:13.380 align:middle line:90%
It's truly incredible.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.384 align:middle line:84%
And so we go through
this progression.

00:32:15.384 --> 00:32:16.550 align:middle line:90%
You want to go to the stars?

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:19.587 align:middle line:84%
Don't use a dumb old chemical
rocket, go to fusion.

00:32:19.587 --> 00:32:21.920 align:middle line:84%
But you better have a good
reason for going to the stars

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.419 align:middle line:84%
if you want to spend
all that money.

00:32:23.419 --> 00:32:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, during World
War II, for fission, A-bombs,

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.150 align:middle line:84%
we built secret facilities
in Oak Ridge, Tennessee

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.410 align:middle line:90%
to separate isotopes of uranium.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:38.860 align:middle line:84%
We built a mile long
facility, one mile long,

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and we used 5% of the
electrical power of the United

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.010 align:middle line:84%
States, 5% of the whole
country's electrical power

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to separate those
isotopes, in secret.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.530 align:middle line:90%
In secret!

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:84%
As many as 50,000 people
worked on the program.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Most of them didn't
know that it had

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.930 align:middle line:84%
anything to do with
nuclear weapons.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:01.870 align:middle line:84%
When the dial shows this,
you turn the screw that way,

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:03.240 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying
is, when we are pushed,

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.740 align:middle line:84%
we can accomplish a
great deal if we're

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.540 align:middle line:90%
willing to devote the resources.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:90%
And we can do it in secret.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.117 align:middle line:90%
Now why the secret?

00:33:14.117 --> 00:33:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Because, you don't
want your opponents

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.584 align:middle line:90%
to know what you know.

00:33:17.584 --> 00:33:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Even though,
they're doing the same thing.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.546 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:33:20.546 --> 00:33:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Look, you don't want them
to know you they know, even.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.760 align:middle line:90%
On top of it.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.260 align:middle line:90%
So secrecy is a part of life.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.486 align:middle line:84%
And it would be interesting
to get the views of everybody

00:33:32.486 --> 00:33:35.110 align:middle line:84%
as to, what would happen if the
government made an announcement

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:36.980 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow, the
queen and the pope,

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.110 align:middle line:84%
well, I'd better rush
that up pretty quick.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:40.068 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The new pope.

00:33:40.068 --> 00:33:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: The new
pope-- that indeed,

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:84%
aliens are visiting Earth
and they're neutral.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.726 align:middle line:84%
What if that was
the announcement,

00:33:45.726 --> 00:33:46.521 align:middle line:90%
what would happen?

00:33:46.521 --> 00:33:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Church attendance would go up.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Mental hospital
admissions would go up.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Stock market would
go down, of course.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.594 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Control would go down?

00:33:52.594 --> 00:33:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: I think the
younger generation, though,

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.490 align:middle line:84%
would push for a new
view of ourselves.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Instead of as Americans,
Canadians, Brits,

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.037 align:middle line:90%
Greeks, Peruvians, earthlings.

00:34:03.037 --> 00:34:05.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from an alien view
point, we are all earthlings.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:06.536 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: We are earthlings.

00:34:06.536 --> 00:34:07.146 align:middle line:90%
We're one.

00:34:07.146 --> 00:34:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: There are a lot of
governments on this planet that

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.480 align:middle line:84%
don't want their citizens to
owe their primary allegiance

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.300 align:middle line:90%
to the government of the planet.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Nationalism is the
only game in town.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:18.860 align:middle line:90%
I live in Canada.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.409 align:middle line:90%
Quebec wants its own country.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are other places
that want their own country.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.537 align:middle line:84%
People in power don't want
to lose power, George.

00:34:25.537 --> 00:34:26.620 align:middle line:90%
That's been my experience.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:27.719 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure it's been yours.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:28.969 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And that is so true.

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: So there's some
serious things to think about

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But don't let anybody tell you,
you can't get here from there.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Are they learning
how to bend space and time?

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:43.810 align:middle line:84%
If we had two dots on this
piece of paper and fold it,

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:44.929 align:middle line:90%
we're there.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Have they learned how to
go through a wormhole?

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, the display
I make is like this way.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.726 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going along
the diagonal, go this way.

00:34:54.726 --> 00:34:55.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, George.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.440 align:middle line:84%
The theoreticians are
doing their thing.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.742 align:middle line:84%
But governments
aren't big on theory.

00:35:00.742 --> 00:35:04.170 align:middle line:84%
They want bombs, not the theory
of bombs, you know what I mean.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
of talk about that.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
astrophysicist can get away

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.385 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of
theoretical stuff.

00:35:10.385 --> 00:35:12.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to
demonstrate anything.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.290 align:middle line:84%
When I worked in industry,
we had to make things work.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
whole point of the game.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.060 align:middle line:90%
And it was kind of a game.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Look, I was working
on nuclear airplanes.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We operated jet engines
on nuclear power.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any flying nuclear
airplanes, as far as I know.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Unlimited range, that
would be kind of neat.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.056 align:middle line:84%
Change the engine every
few thousand hours,

00:35:33.056 --> 00:35:34.180 align:middle line:90%
that would be kind of neat.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Let me go back to that
aircraft carrier, though.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.320 align:middle line:84%
My vision of what's
going on-- we

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.040 align:middle line:84%
have a number of reports
of huge mother-ships.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A mile long.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah, a mile long,
that's a pretty good size.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Even if only have
1/2 a mile, George.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have a bunch of small
objects that come out of them.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:58.395 align:middle line:90%
People have seen them.

00:35:58.395 --> 00:36:00.520 align:middle line:84%
A perfect example is those
nuclear powered aircraft

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.020 align:middle line:90%
carriers.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:06.010 align:middle line:84%
They carry 75 little
airplanes about 50 feet long,

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.130 align:middle line:84%
which don't perform worth
a darn on the water.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Just that as the carrier
doesn't work well in the sky.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.380 align:middle line:90%


00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Three hours maybe,
without refueling

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:18.290 align:middle line:84%
on an airplane, if
you're very lucky.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:21.050 align:middle line:84%
The carrier goes 18
years without refueling.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:26.730 align:middle line:84%
If you're going between
the stars, fusion is great.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Getting close to
the speed of light.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Speed of light
around this planet

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.581 align:middle line:90%
doesn't do you much good.

00:36:30.581 --> 00:36:32.670 align:middle line:84%
You go around the planet
in 1/7 of a second.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:84%
How do meet somebody for dinner
if you're going that fast?

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's an entirely
different environment.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.320 align:middle line:84%
The atmosphere causes
drag and heating

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.870 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of bad stuff.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.300 align:middle line:90%
So we have a direct analogy.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Case up in the Yukon, 32
witnesses, a civil engineer

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.430 align:middle line:84%
looked at all the
data, put together

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.650 align:middle line:90%
a triangulation picture.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:59.600 align:middle line:90%
6/10 to 1.2 miles long.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.550 align:middle line:84%
A case that Japan
Airlines flight,

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.380 align:middle line:90%
747, this thing came up.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.390 align:middle line:90%
Went around them.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:11.032 align:middle line:84%
Twice the size of an
aircraft carrier they say.

00:37:11.032 --> 00:37:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sheesh.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: They talked
to the ground, radar guys.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:18.520 align:middle line:90%
They saw them and this UFO.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.394 align:middle line:84%
They got permission
to do a circle,

00:37:20.394 --> 00:37:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and this thing's
station kept with them,

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.730 align:middle line:90%
kept at the same location.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.987 align:middle line:84%
Now the debunkers will
say, that was Jupiter.

00:37:27.987 --> 00:37:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Seen by the plane radar, mind
you, and the ground radar.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.379 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: And station
keeping with an airplane going

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.840 align:middle line:90%
in a circle.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.740 align:middle line:90%
How ludicrous can you get?

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense, in
other words, what we see.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd be surprised if there was
one system doing everything.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why are they following
planes, and things like that?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: I think
they want to know--

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's
they're curiosity.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: --what
their capabilities are.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.790 align:middle line:84%
They want to know, not just
their flight capability,

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:56.490 align:middle line:84%
but what electromagnetic
fields do they give out?

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.950 align:middle line:84%
We certainly want
to know frequency

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:01.420 align:middle line:84%
of the radar,
frequency of the radio,

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.730 align:middle line:90%
if we're checking on aircraft.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to home
in with rockets, you know.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:10.010 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to kill guys if
you can pick them up and detect

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.200 align:middle line:84%
them and use instrumentation
to do all the work,

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.600 align:middle line:90%
instead of just eyeballing it.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it true that
they sometimes take aircraft,

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and we just don't hear
anything about them?

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, I've--
yeah, George, it is.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Take may not be quite right.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's disintegrate.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.330 align:middle line:84%
But on seven different
occasions in the course

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.990 align:middle line:84%
of my lecturing
all over the world,

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I have been quietly
told, people weren't

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:37.190 align:middle line:84%
looking for attention,
of airplanes going up

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.060 align:middle line:84%
to chase UFOs and
not coming back.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And Frank Feschino's
book, "Shoot Them Down,"

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.950 align:middle line:84%
in the first five
years of the '50s,

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:52.680 align:middle line:84%
we lost over 200 military
airplanes, fatal crashes.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.377 align:middle line:84%
And the New York Times used
words like disintegrate.

00:38:55.377 --> 00:38:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Chasing objects?

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Dissapeared.

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to
guys, I talk to one guy.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.880 align:middle line:84%
It turned out, he was stationed
at a base in South Carolina.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.142 align:middle line:84%
He was scrambled, Navy pilot,
at night, bogey coming in.

00:39:09.142 --> 00:39:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Scrambled him up.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:10.710 align:middle line:90%
He gets up.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:13.030 align:middle line:84%
He's talking to the
guy on the ground.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's coming
right up to you.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.130 align:middle line:84%
This thing comes up,
comes right at him.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Shines a very bright light.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:23.250 align:middle line:84%
He puts up his hand, he can
see the bones in his hand.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.520 align:middle line:90%
He's got to do something.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:84%
He pulls the
trigger on his guns.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.910 align:middle line:90%
The guns hadn't been loaded.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.670 align:middle line:90%
So he got back.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:34.260 align:middle line:84%
He's talking to the guys on the
ground while this is going on.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:84%
When he lands, he
gets interrogated

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.135 align:middle line:84%
by two suits, and
some uniform guys.

00:39:39.135 --> 00:39:41.260 align:middle line:84%
They had apparently heard
something like this story

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.224 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:39:42.224 --> 00:39:43.390 align:middle line:90%
And I've talked to this guy.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:90%
He went on to be a lawyer.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And he still was flying
for many years after that.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.490 align:middle line:84%
We agreed that probably the
only reason he was alive

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.560 align:middle line:84%
is that his guns
hadn't been loaded.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.610 align:middle line:84%
They weren't hostile, in
other words, in general.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Unless.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah, you
do something to them.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yeah, unless.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.694 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: And I've
got a bunch of stories.

00:40:02.694 --> 00:40:04.247 align:middle line:84%
Look, if I've heard
seven examples,

00:40:04.247 --> 00:40:05.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there's a
lot more out there.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I want to come
back with some of those.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:84%
But let's take a few more just
questions for Stanton Friedman,

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.890 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Can you speak a
bit more to like the theoretical

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:18.870 align:middle line:84%
science behind the ability
to get here within time?

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:84%
You talk about
fusion rockets being

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.660 align:middle line:90%
able to propel you to a place.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.512 align:middle line:84%
But where there's likely
planets that would host life,

00:40:26.512 --> 00:40:27.970 align:middle line:84%
they're tens of
thousands, hundreds

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:29.510 align:middle line:84%
of thousands, millions
of light years away.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.420 align:middle line:90%
So by the time they would--

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Wait just a minute.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Why do you say that?

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.980 align:middle line:84%
The galaxy is about
100,000 lightyears across.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Within 50 light years of here,
there's well over 1,000 stars.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.025 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
go way out there.

00:40:44.025 --> 00:40:45.830 align:middle line:84%
There's planets
all over the place.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's the neat thing about
the Kepler Space Satellite.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm a real fan.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at an area of the
sky about as big as your first

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.370 align:middle line:90%
at arm's length.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.107 align:middle line:90%
It's on an elongated orbit.

00:40:59.107 --> 00:41:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's finding planets
all over the place.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: All over,
just in that spot.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Just there.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Incredible number.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So the place, my favorite
source for aliens,

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:11.610 align:middle line:84%
if you will, from the--
it's in the book "Captured,

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:16.380 align:middle line:84%
The Betty and Barney
Hill UFO Experience,"

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.720 align:middle line:84%
the base stars in that
story-- it's a long story,

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:84%
read the book--
but the base stars

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.290 align:middle line:90%
are only 39.3 lightyears away.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:28.250 align:middle line:84%
But look at how different
they are from our situation.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Those two stars are only
an eighth of a lightyear

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.759 align:middle line:90%
apart from each other.

00:41:33.759 --> 00:41:35.300 align:middle line:84%
They're 30 times
closer to each other

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.883 align:middle line:84%
than the sun is to
the next star over.

00:41:36.883 --> 00:41:38.840 align:middle line:90%
We're out in the boonies.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, those two stars
are a billion years older

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.680 align:middle line:90%
than the sun.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.720 align:middle line:84%
From a planet around one,
looking at the other,

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.376 align:middle line:84%
you can directly observe
the other star all day long.

00:41:49.376 --> 00:41:51.500 align:middle line:84%
You can tell where there's
life around the planets,

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.874 align:middle line:84%
because of the
biological effects

00:41:52.874 --> 00:41:54.820 align:middle line:84%
on the atmosphere
of those planets.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need to
talk about thousands,

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.240 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of lightyears.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.980 align:middle line:84%
It just down the street,
around the corner.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So the situation is very
different from the way

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.530 align:middle line:90%
we like to think of it as being.

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.800 align:middle line:84%
There's maybe 200 billion
stars in the galaxy.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's counted them all,
but it's a number like that.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
just down the street.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I guess I'm
remembering very basic college

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:19.882 align:middle line:90%
astronomy.

00:42:19.882 --> 00:42:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in advancement
or anything.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:26.810 align:middle line:84%
But the uniqueness of the Earth
being at a particular distance

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:29.980 align:middle line:84%
with, like, X amount of
light and heat and energy

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.480 align:middle line:90%
from the sun, is unique.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's likely that
that exists elsewhere.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.920 align:middle line:84%
But the existence of
where we are with our sun

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.300 align:middle line:84%
is very unique, within
a large time span.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean like, our Earth's
going to ceased to exist.

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:43.636 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: The habitable
zone, as the astronomers,

00:42:43.636 --> 00:42:45.980 align:middle line:84%
the radio astronomers
like to talk about.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.770 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is, we
have, because of Kepler,

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:53.350 align:middle line:84%
found many multiple
planet star systems.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:56.010 align:middle line:90%
And no big deal.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.260 align:middle line:84%
There's another thing
that gets left out.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.900 align:middle line:84%
You see, the radio
astronomers, the SETI cultists,

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:05.690 align:middle line:84%
as I call them, if you
want a nasty phrase,

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:10.410 align:middle line:90%
they rule out colonization.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.340 align:middle line:90%
They rule out migration.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.930 align:middle line:90%
They rule out terraforming.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:18.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you were to go
to Las Vegas 200 years ago,

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.670 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be a very
nice place to visit.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.900 align:middle line:84%
You would have trouble finding
a place to live, to eat,

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.200 align:middle line:84%
you know, just
withstand the sun.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.290 align:middle line:90%
We terraformed it.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.340 align:middle line:84%
We made it suitable
for intelligent life.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll put quotes
around the intelligent life.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:37.630 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, you see my point?

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Every advanced
civilization is going

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to know that it needs
to have a storm cellar.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Things happen.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:49.230 align:middle line:84%
An asteroid went by the
other day, probably connected

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.350 align:middle line:84%
with it, although
they wouldn't say so,

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:53.030 align:middle line:84%
what happened in
the Soviet Union.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Remember that meteor?

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.005 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
people died, if any.

00:43:57.005 --> 00:43:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But there were a lot
of people injured,

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:02.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot of buildings--
it made kind of a mess.

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm told by
a good astronomer

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I know that the
two were connected.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:12.740 align:middle line:84%
There are asteroids that
have satellites around them.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.700 align:middle line:90%
They come in clusters.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think we have to expect
that aliens will know where

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:26.520 align:middle line:84%
it's suitable for life, just as
we do now, and would know where

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:84%
there is activity, because
of the signals they get.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect every
library in the neighborhood

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.840 align:middle line:84%
can tell you where
there is civilizations.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, yeah, that
star over there is Sol.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are living,
thinking beings over there.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:41.900 align:middle line:90%
They're nasty son of guns.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to spend your
vacation over there, you know.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just as common for
aliens to be traipsing around,

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:58.180 align:middle line:84%
as it is for us to
take airplanes to go,

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.340 align:middle line:84%
you know, visit our girlfriend,
grandmother, grandchild,

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.470 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And if I had said that 150 years
ago, what would you have said?

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Look how long it takes my horse
and wagon to go from point A

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.934 align:middle line:90%
to point B.

00:45:10.934 --> 00:45:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You can't
get there that fast.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: You can't
get there from here.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:14.530 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, you can.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:20.940 align:middle line:84%
My basic rule,
technological progress

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.640 align:middle line:84%
comes from doing
things differently

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.300 align:middle line:90%
in an unpredictable way.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.010 align:middle line:84%
The future is not an
extrapolation of the past.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to change
how you do things.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I got a shock, I was
talking to college students

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and relating how much times
have changed in my work life.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:41.980 align:middle line:84%
When I started work in industry,
I said, I used a slide rule.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I looked around the class.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Nobody batted an eye.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.874 align:middle line:84%
I said, any of you know
what a slide rule is?

00:45:46.874 --> 00:45:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Not one student in the class.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was less
than 50 years earlier.

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.720 align:middle line:90%
So times change.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And your capabilities,
what you can do.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.745 align:middle line:84%
When the supersonic
transport was flying,

00:45:58.745 --> 00:46:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll bet there were guys or
gals that went from New York

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:04.600 align:middle line:84%
to London to have a weekend with
their girlfriend or a boyfriend

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.430 align:middle line:90%
and came back.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't do that
if it takes you six weeks

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.280 align:middle line:90%
to cross the ocean.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So we need to get rid of
our egos, our arrogance

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.150 align:middle line:90%
and our ignorance.

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Every direction
you look, progress

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.840 align:middle line:90%
from doing things differently.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Moore's Law, I hope
everybody's heard

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.890 align:middle line:84%
of Moore's Law, the
number of transistors

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:29.867 align:middle line:84%
you can place on a
chip doubles every--

00:46:29.867 --> 00:46:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Couple of years.

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah, or a couple
of years, a year, two years.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:34.350 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't sound
like much when

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:36.060 align:middle line:84%
you say how many times
have you doubled, whoops.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.476 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's
dramatic, dramatic.

00:46:37.476 --> 00:46:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: So now you got a
little chip this big that's got

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.800 align:middle line:84%
a zillion transistors on
it-- the equivalent on it.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.790 align:middle line:84%
That's just within
recent life span.

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So don't worry about them
being able-- their problem is

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.210 align:middle line:84%
the choice of where do
they go for the weekend.

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Not how
do they get there.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Not
can we go anywhere.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.988 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: We're going to
come back on "Beyond Belief"

00:46:57.988 --> 00:47:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and Stan will talk
about space exploration.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.407 align:middle line:90%
So don't go away.

00:47:02.407 --> 00:47:06.375 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:06.375 --> 00:47:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And welcome
back to "Beyond Belief"

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.210 align:middle line:84%
with our special guest,
Stanton Friedman.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I notice you brought us
a little buddy, here.

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Somebody sent me that
about 20 years ago.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.920 align:middle line:84%
He had heard me on
a television show

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and thought I'd
appreciate having--

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.880 align:middle line:84%
he's pretty heavy to
carry in your briefcase,

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.000 align:middle line:90%
to tell you the truth.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So they look this way?

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:26.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
described them like this.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:28.890 align:middle line:90%
The important thing is humanoid.

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:31.600 align:middle line:84%
You notice, two
eyes, they don't seem

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to have much in the way
of lips or nostrils.

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:35.040 align:middle line:90%
But humanoid.

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Long fingers, you can see
there, if you look carefully.

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why is
the head so big?

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: More
brains, I guess.

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:46.080 align:middle line:84%
That's a good reason as
any, as far as I know.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And there may be, look,
there may be a zillion

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.270 align:middle line:84%
different civilizations
out there,

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:51.850 align:middle line:90%
where they all look different.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:52.940 align:middle line:90%
And maybe they interact.

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.550 align:middle line:84%
They have a convention
every 10 years.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:47:56.030 --> 00:48:00.500 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is, we
have lots of reports

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.372 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
been abducted,

00:48:02.372 --> 00:48:04.080 align:middle line:84%
who have seen these
physical trace cases,

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.455 align:middle line:84%
where they see
these guys walking

00:48:05.455 --> 00:48:07.870 align:middle line:90%
around doing their thing.

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:09.905 align:middle line:90%
Does Uncle Sam have specimens?

00:48:09.905 --> 00:48:11.405 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was
more than one crash.

00:48:11.405 --> 00:48:12.730 align:middle line:90%
You know, Roswell is one.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.150 align:middle line:90%
There's Aztec is another.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Cape Girardeau?

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Regina in Brazil.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.280 align:middle line:90%
There's Cape Girardeau.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Who knows how many?

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Uncle Sam isn't talking.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Boy, could he set
up a zoo, though.

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Why do
they crash, Stan?

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: I think, I was
going to say pilot error,

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:31.720 align:middle line:84%
human error, well, forget
the human part of that,

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:32.840 align:middle line:90%
pilot error.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Why do our airplanes crash?

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.680 align:middle line:90%
We have 747s that crash.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.360 align:middle line:84%
We've lost two shuttles,
sophisticated vehicles.

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Something goes wrong,
in the case of Roswell,

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:48.570 align:middle line:84%
we think possibly they were
going across a radar beam

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and it affected their
guidance system,

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:56.670 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better phrase, or
maybe their propulsion system.

00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Two objects traveling together,
you get a sudden glitch, whamo.

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I talked
to a guy who had

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.080 align:middle line:90%
been a pilot for a long time.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, when you have
a midair collision,

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:11.320 align:middle line:84%
is the damage usually
the same to both craft?

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.650 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Usually one makes it, and
the other one goes in.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: The other one gets it.

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.544 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: And we had another
crash over in the Plains of San

00:49:18.544 --> 00:49:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Agustin.

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And this one
exploded, apparently.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.860 align:middle line:90%
So who knows?

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.270 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the price you pay.

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:28.987 align:middle line:84%
But if you start
looking at statistics,

00:49:28.987 --> 00:49:31.320 align:middle line:84%
you'd be surprised at how
many airplane crashes we have.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Do we have a captured
alien, extraterrestrial,

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:39.754 align:middle line:90%
put somewhere and we've got him.

00:49:39.754 --> 00:49:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well,
I think we had.

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Whether we-- I've
heard enough reports

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:47.640 align:middle line:84%
from enough people that
said probably at Los Alamos.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Why Los Alamos?

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a very high
security facility.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.940 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of people, all kinds
of technological backgrounds

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:58.790 align:middle line:84%
for the people, good
place to keep an alien.

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:01.330 align:middle line:84%
You have people whose job
it is to communicate with.

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Could be at Area 51.

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:06.630 align:middle line:84%
But Los Alamos was there well
before Area 51 was there.

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So you need to go someplace
now with the body.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.025 align:middle line:84%
I think we have
recovered alien bodies.

00:50:15.025 --> 00:50:17.080 align:middle line:84%
The people I've
talked to, with regard

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.190 align:middle line:84%
to the Plains of San
Agustin, even Roswell.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Walter Haut, the guy who
put out the press release,

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.710 align:middle line:84%
in a statement released
after his death,

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:29.641 align:middle line:84%
indicated that he had seen
a little guy under a tarp,

00:50:29.641 --> 00:50:30.390 align:middle line:90%
not very far away.

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:31.431 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: A military guy.

00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Why would he lie, right?

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: No reason at all.

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.305 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was not just a PR
guy, Walter was a bombardier.

00:50:38.305 --> 00:50:40.821 align:middle line:90%
He flew 20 missions over Japan.

00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was a good
enough bombardier,

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.700 align:middle line:84%
he was chosen to drop the
instrument package over one

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.250 align:middle line:84%
of the two nuclear
weapons tested

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:50.020 align:middle line:90%
in Operation Crossroads in 1946.

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.470 align:middle line:84%
You pick your best people,
because if the packages isn't

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:55.140 align:middle line:84%
in the right place,
it's a wasted test.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So high level security
clearance, real patriot,

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.800 align:middle line:90%
great guy, too.

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.567 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine
why he would lie.

00:51:03.567 --> 00:51:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's an amazing story.

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Everybody in town
who I talk to about Walter over

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:11.940 align:middle line:84%
a 20 year period had only
good things to say about him.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Small town, everybody
knows everybody else.

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:17.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's different
than the big city.

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.522 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is the
mortician still around?

00:51:19.522 --> 00:51:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Glenn is--

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.105 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: He's getting
up there in age.

00:51:22.105 --> 00:51:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: He's up in
age, and he is in a home.

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was the first
to talk to him.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:31.839 align:middle line:84%
And no reason-- and I went
with him to the mortuary.

00:51:31.839 --> 00:51:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Found somebody there who knew
him when he worked there,

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and all that sort of stuff.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, heard
only good things.

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:39.740 align:middle line:90%
And we looked for certain files.

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, so and so,
who was here after you,

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:43.820 align:middle line:90%
dumped a lot of files.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:44.746 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Got rid of everything.

00:51:44.746 --> 00:51:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:46.510 align:middle line:90%
So what are you going to do?

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:49.399 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But he was told to
have three little caskets,

00:51:49.399 --> 00:51:49.940 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.356 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well,
he asked about,

00:51:51.356 --> 00:51:54.350 align:middle line:84%
how quickly can we get
caskets, small ones?

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And what should we
used to preserve a body

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:00.160 align:middle line:90%
if we want to run tests on it?

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.841 align:middle line:84%
And Glenn's solution was,
dry ice, incidentally.

00:52:03.841 --> 00:52:05.590 align:middle line:84%
It gets pretty hot in
Roswell, New Mexico,

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:06.923 align:middle line:90%
incidentally, in the summertime.

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:07.832 align:middle line:90%
It can get up to 110.

00:52:07.832 --> 00:52:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Something happened.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah, so he was
asked the sensible questions.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe his story of made
sense, under the circumstances.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And he named a nurse, most
people don't know this,

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.820 align:middle line:84%
but he named a nurse
that had told him stuff.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, I ran a letter
in a publication

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:31.910 align:middle line:84%
of one of these alumni
military groups, you know.

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:34.835 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who served at this
base at this time frame.

00:52:34.835 --> 00:52:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And I heard from somebody
who had been at Roswell.

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out he
was teaching science

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:43.030 align:middle line:90%
when I finally talked to him.

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And I gave him the
names of the nurses

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:49.894 align:middle line:84%
at the base in alphabetical
order, from the year book.

00:52:49.894 --> 00:52:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Not saying anything
special about any of them.

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And he remembered, oh,
she lived in Georgia.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.500 align:middle line:84%
She was dating-- he
was 18 at the time,

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.000 align:middle line:90%
so he was aware of the nurses.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I gave him the name that
Glenn Dennis gave me.

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I remember her.

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:05.360 align:middle line:90%
What did she look like?

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell him what Glenn
had said she looked like,

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:11.150 align:middle line:84%
because that would be
just getting an echo.

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:13.780 align:middle line:84%
He described her in
exactly the same terms.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Short, very attractive, a
few other words, dark hair,

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.450 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I know those two guys
didn't know each other.

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of a nice
backup to Glenn's story.

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And the nurse
backed up what Glenn said?

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: Well, yeah.

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What's this?

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:34.140 align:middle line:90%
What did you bring us, here?

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: You can read,
there's a word on there.

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:44.560 align:middle line:84%
N-E-R-V-A, Nuclear Energy for
Rocket Vehicle Applications.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:48.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a model of one of
a number of nuclear rocket

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:52.000 align:middle line:84%
engines that were actually
operated at the nuclear test

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.500 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.458 align:middle line:90%
Not far from Area 51, yes.

00:53:55.458 --> 00:53:57.166 align:middle line:84%
I worked on the program
for Westinghouse.

00:53:57.166 --> 00:54:00.600 align:middle line:90%


00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:84%
The engine we built, less
than 7 feet in diameter,

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:10.480 align:middle line:84%
ours only had a power
level of 1,100 megawatts.

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos-- you
use liquid hydrogen,

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:16.424 align:middle line:90%
there'd be a big tank up here.

00:54:16.424 --> 00:54:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Liquid hydrogen is pumped
through the reactor, which

00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:22.710 align:middle line:84%
is in here, heated
to over 4,000 degrees

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:25.070 align:middle line:90%
and kicked out the nozzle.

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Los Alamos built one, it
was a little larger, 8 feet

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:33.280 align:middle line:84%
in diameter, The PHEBBUS,
two B. It operated

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.490 align:middle line:84%
at a power level
of 4,400 megawatts,

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that's twice the power of Grand
Cooley Dam, 8 feet in diameter.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:45.360 align:middle line:90%
This is back in the '60s.

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.820 align:middle line:84%
It would not be used
as a launch vehicle.

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.200 align:middle line:84%
You put it into orbit,
then you'd start up there.

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And then head off toward Mars,
or the moon, or wherever.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.750 align:middle line:84%
This is back in
the '60s, mind you.

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.610 align:middle line:84%
These weren't
theoretical systems.

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:00.860 align:middle line:90%
It gets pretty hot.

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.434 align:middle line:84%
And I was very happy
when we ran our tests.

00:55:03.434 --> 00:55:05.100 align:middle line:84%
We were listening in
Pittsburgh and this

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.740 align:middle line:90%
was going on out in Nevada.

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And the question was, how
long would the system last?

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:12.280 align:middle line:84%
There was a limit to how
long you could run it,

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.890 align:middle line:84%
because you needed
liquid hydrogen

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:18.860 align:middle line:84%
to cool it after it shut down,
because it was radioactive.

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.580 align:middle line:90%
10 minutes, 20 minutes?

00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're giving us nominal
temperature, nominal pressure,

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:24.780 align:middle line:90%
10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30.

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Hey, we're-- it went
the full 60 minutes.

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:30.470 align:middle line:90%
It was a very joyous moment.

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:32.152 align:middle line:84%
I had had some
experiments on it.

00:55:32.152 --> 00:55:33.110 align:middle line:90%
And I was very pleased.

00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And what
year was that, Stan?

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.025 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: That
would have been 1968.

00:55:36.025 --> 00:55:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So now, where
are we, technologically?

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.526 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: The program was
canceled two years later.

00:55:41.526 --> 00:55:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Could there
be a Black Ops program,

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.640 align:middle line:90%
a secret program going on?

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: I suppose.

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:47.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is just fission.

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:48.299 align:middle line:90%
Fusion is much more exciting.

00:55:48.299 --> 00:55:48.923 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:55:48.923 --> 00:55:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: H-bombs
versus atomic bomb.

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.990 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
this is reality.

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:55.370 align:middle line:90%
This is a model.

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:58.010 align:middle line:90%
But these things worked.

00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:59.750 align:middle line:90%
It was exciting.

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And no, you didn't
have scores of people

00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:02.790 align:middle line:90%
standing around watching.

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:03.810 align:middle line:90%
It's radioactive.

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:06.790 align:middle line:84%
You go over there
where you're shielded.

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: When we go back to
the moon, when we go to Mars,

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:11.612 align:middle line:90%
what are we going to use?

00:56:11.612 --> 00:56:13.444 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: That's an
interesting question.

00:56:13.444 --> 00:56:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I was in a panel down in
Florida where a NASA man

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.724 align:middle line:84%
told me, this was about
over 10 years ago,

00:56:18.724 --> 00:56:20.140 align:middle line:84%
told me that they
were considering

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.000 align:middle line:90%
using a nuclear third stage.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.660 align:middle line:84%
This would be used
as an upper stage.

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:28.080 align:middle line:84%
About twice the miles per
gallon, to put in simple

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:32.660 align:middle line:84%
minded terms, as
a chemical rocket.

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Two to three times as
many miles per gallon.

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So he was talking about
using this as an upper stage.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.480 align:middle line:84%
What's been missing is, we
don't have a space program.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.140 align:middle line:90%
We don't have a goal.

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy set a goal.

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And we could achieve
subsidiary goals.

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Everybody I worked with in the
Space Program back in the '60s

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.080 align:middle line:84%
thought we would have a
base on the moon by now.

00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.850 align:middle line:84%
You didn't say they'd
be speaking Chinese.

00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:01.560 align:middle line:90%
But that's where we're heading.

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.317 align:middle line:84%
Thought we would
have a base on Mars.

00:57:04.317 --> 00:57:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It just stopped.

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: A failure of will.

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Worst meeting I ever
sat in on, in my life,

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:10.940 align:middle line:90%
I was at Aerojet General.

00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:13.540 align:middle line:84%
They were working on
these same things.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And my guy, radiation
shielding, hey, Stan.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.520 align:middle line:84%
You want to go to
a NASA meeting?

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.569 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:57:19.569 --> 00:57:21.110 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of the
meeting was to try

00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:24.650 align:middle line:84%
to decide what they wanted to
do with a nuclear rocket engine.

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:26.860 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
they wanted to do, George.

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:28.609 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know
what you want to do,

00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:30.009 align:middle line:84%
your funding is
going to run out.

00:57:30.009 --> 00:57:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: In the moments
we have let, Stan,

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk with
you about SETI,

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.044 align:middle line:84%
Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence.

00:57:36.044 --> 00:57:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> FRIEDMAN: No.

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Silly Effort To
Investigate, George,

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:40.340 align:middle line:90%
that's what S-E-T-I stands for.

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: They are listening
for communications from ETs.

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Yet they do not believe
we've been visited to date.

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:49.752 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that contradictory?

00:57:49.752 --> 00:57:51.876 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Yeah, they
won't look at the evidence.

00:57:51.876 --> 00:57:53.292 align:middle line:84%
Look, if aliens
are visiting, why

00:57:53.292 --> 00:57:54.500 align:middle line:90%
would you listen for signals?

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.083 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you learn sign
language, George.

00:57:56.083 --> 00:57:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
based on science.

00:57:58.930 --> 00:57:59.922 align:middle line:90%
It's wishful thinking.

00:57:59.922 --> 00:58:01.630 align:middle line:84%
We know how to send
this kind of signals.

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume the
other guy is sending

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:04.210 align:middle line:90%
the same kind of signals.

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:06.021 align:middle line:84%
You remember that
joke about the drunk

00:58:06.021 --> 00:58:08.020 align:middle line:84%
who's looking for his
keys underneath the street

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:09.590 align:middle line:90%
light, George?

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And the cop comes over.

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:11.371 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:58:11.371 --> 00:58:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking for my keys.

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Where did you lose them?

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Well, oh, down there.

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:16.539 align:middle line:90%
That's my car.

00:58:16.539 --> 00:58:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, why are you looking here?

00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:19.650 align:middle line:90%
There's more light here.

00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:20.974 align:middle line:90%
I can see better.

00:58:20.974 --> 00:58:22.390 align:middle line:84%
We know how to
listen for signals.

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But our first long distance
radio signal was sent in 1901.

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.670 align:middle line:90%
That's what, 112 years ago?

00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:35.260 align:middle line:84%
You think aliens haven't
had a little more time

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:38.520 align:middle line:84%
to develop a better,
more efficient system?

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And besides which,
why would anybody

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.570 align:middle line:84%
send a signal our
direction anyway?

00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Hey, we're bringing
27 guys for dinner.

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Be be ready for us.

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Or we're
coming to take you.

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: Or serve you,
how's that, George, for dinner.

00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:54.690 align:middle line:90%


00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Remember that old
science fiction program,

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:58.060 align:middle line:90%
"Twilight Zone," yeah.

00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:58.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.234 align:middle line:84%
SETI assumes there's
nobody coming here.

00:59:01.234 --> 00:59:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Assumes there's nobody traipsing
around between the stars.

00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Assumes they're stuck at our
level of technology, which

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.420 align:middle line:84%
is a really incred-- I mean, I
don't use a slide rule anymore,

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:12.030 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:12.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:16.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, are they sending
AM or FM, analog or digital?

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Are they sending the key
so we can interpret it?

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Also, all the radio
telescopes are

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.490 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the ground.

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:26.305 align:middle line:84%
Any advanced civilization is
going to put its communication

00:59:26.305 --> 00:59:29.150 align:middle line:84%
systems above the
atmospheres, so you

00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:32.350 align:middle line:84%
can look at the same
place out there, you know?

00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And they refuse to
look at the data.

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:36.504 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Seth Shostak
and I debated.

00:59:36.504 --> 00:59:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: And you won.

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>> FRIEDMAN: And
I won, 57, 33, 10.

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: People believing that
there was extraterrestrial life

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:45.170 align:middle line:90%
already here on the planet.

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear it for
Stanton Friedman,

00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:48.920 align:middle line:84%
the Father of
Modern Day Ufology.

00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.390 align:middle line:84%
You can check him
out on his website.

00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:53.760 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.970 align:middle line:90%
One of the best.

00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:59.350 align:middle line:84%
The next time you look
up into the heavens

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and think for just a moment that
there are actually other living

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:middle line:84%
beings living out there on
other planetary systems,

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:09.890 align:middle line:84%
think of my buddy,
Stanton Friedman,

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:14.080 align:middle line:84%
with a passion to get
the correct answers

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.720 align:middle line:84%
to that incredible
mystery question,

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.770 align:middle line:90%
are we alone in the universe?

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:20.983 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

01:00:20.983 --> 01:00:26.320 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:45.600 align:middle line:90%
