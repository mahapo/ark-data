>>GEORGE NOORY: What is
bioenergetic medicine?

00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADLEY NELSON:
Bioenergetic medicine

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.980 align:middle line:84%
just looks at the body for
what it is, an energy field,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and tries to find
the imbalances that

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.450 align:middle line:84%
are going on that are
preventing that energy field

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:90%
from functioning perfectly.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.907 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: In my practice,
I was obsessed with getting

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:90%
to the underlying causes.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Why were these people sick?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I wrote "The Emotion
Code" because I

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:84%
had learned that we all
have emotional baggage.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.485 align:middle line:84%
And emotional baggage
is the emotional energy

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:84%
that gets stuck in
our bodies, but it's

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.550 align:middle line:90%
possible to get rid of them.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It's far from the old
ways of looking at things,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:90%
but it is the new science.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:84%
It is the new technology that
is going to change the world.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.233 align:middle line:90%
It's inevitable.

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, welcome

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Bradley Nelson back with us.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.025 align:middle line:84%
Bradley, welcome
back to the program.

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Thanks for
having me, George.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.378 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Exactly what is
bioenergetic medicine?

00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:10%
>>NELSON: Well,
bioenergetic medicine

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:10%
is simply a way of looking at
the body for what it really is.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:10%
And what the body really is is
a very complex energy field.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:10%
For example, if you look at your
hand, it looks familiar to you.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:10%
But if you were to magnify
it a million times or more,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:10%
ultimately you'd be looking
at a single individual atom

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.058 align:middle line:10%
when you get past the cells
and the molecules, and so on.

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look
inside that atom,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:84%
you'd see there's
really nothing in there.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.412 align:middle line:84%
It's just empty space with some
little infinitesimally tiny

00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
energies that are zipping
around at the speed--

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Holding
us together, right?

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Holding
us together, yeah.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.398 align:middle line:84%
Allowing us to have
this experience

00:01:51.398 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:90%
we're having in this world.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.281 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we are, is
we're beings of pure energy.

00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So bioenergetic
medicine just looks

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
at the body for what
it is, an energy field,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:84%
and tries to find
the imbalances that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
are going on that are
preventing that energy field

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.100 align:middle line:90%
from functioning perfectly.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's looking at
things on a deeper level

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:90%
than we usually do.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it that
got you into this field?

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: That's
a good question.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:84%
It really started back
when I was seven years old.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Seven?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Believe it or not.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I was really sick
with the measles.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I had overheard
my parents talking,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.262 align:middle line:84%
and I knew the plan was that
I was going to be admitted

00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:90%
to the hospital the next day.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was going into something
called an oxygen tent, which

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they have
anymore, but they did back in.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking
that the tent part of that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.997 align:middle line:84%
sounded kind of
interesting, but I

00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:44.183 align:middle line:84%
was too sick to really
think about camping.

00:02:44.183 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And my parents
came into the room.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
They'd made a bed
for me on the couch

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:90%
so I could be near their room.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Everyone else had gone to bed.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And they came into the room,
and my mother said to my father,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.843 align:middle line:84%
she said, honey, will
you kneel down with me

00:02:53.843 --> 00:02:56.793 align:middle line:84%
and say a prayer so that our
boy will be able to get well?

00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
scared, weren't they?

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: They were scared.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And I was just really sick.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So they knelt down by
the side of the couch.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
My dad starts
offering this prayer.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.275 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of this
prayer, this change happened.

00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It started at the top of
my head and it went whoosh

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
through my body to
the soles of my feet,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and I was instantly made well.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Now to go from being
really sick one moment

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
to being totally well
in the next instant

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
is something that's so
bizarre and so impossible

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:90%
that you can't ever forget it.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.805 align:middle line:84%
And I remember every
moment of that night

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:90%
like it happened yesterday.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did it,
the prayer or you?

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: The prayer--
well, I think--

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
well, the conclusion
that I came to

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.495 align:middle line:84%
was that there's a higher
power that we can draw upon

00:03:38.495 --> 00:03:40.285 align:middle line:90%
and we can ask for help.

00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really been
the theme of all the work

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.618 align:middle line:84%
that I've done over all
these years with "The Emotion

00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Code," with "The Body Code,"
Discover Healing, and so

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:84%
on, that there is
that higher power.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And we all believe
different things,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
but what I've come to know is
that if you ask, you receive.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:10%
And when I was in practice, I
got into this habit, whenever

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:10%
anybody would come in to see
me, I would just take a moment.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And I had this very
personal, very private habit

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:84%
where I would just ask
for help from up above.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'd ask God to help me.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:90%
And we call God different names.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Source energy or
creator or whatever.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But there were times,
George, during those years

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
when the information
that I needed

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:84%
would just flood into me like
an avalanche of understanding.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it was a
totally different way

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:84%
of looking at things than
what I'd ever imagined before.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
See, I was obsessed with
getting my patients well.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And as time went
on, the people that

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:84%
were coming to see me were
presenting with more and more

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.132 align:middle line:84%
difficult problems so that
during the last 10 years

00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that I was in practice, most
of the people that I saw

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:84%
had been told there was really
no hope at all for them.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was over for them.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: It was over for them.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
They were just going to have
to live with their problems

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were so sick
they were literally praying

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:90%
not to die.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
unacceptable to me.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Well, yes.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
unacceptable to me.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I found, though, was
that within each one of us,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:84%
there was this intelligence, the
subconscious mind, the inner us

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:90%
that knows what we really need.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you ask the questions
to that inner person,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
that subconscious mind,
you get the answers.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.197 align:middle line:84%
Our work with "The Emotion
Code" and "The Body Code"

00:05:16.197 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
is all based on that,
getting those answers.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote "The
Emotion Code" because I

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:84%
had learned that we all
have emotional baggage.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And emotional baggage
I came to understand

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
is the emotional energy that
gets stuck in our bodies

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
after these emotional events
that we experience that we'd

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:90%
rather not go through.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But there were people
that would come to see me,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I
would know that they

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:84%
had other emotional baggage,
other trapped emotions

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't find.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you could tell.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, I could
tell that there was more.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something was there.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Sometimes they'd been
through something traumatic

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't find any
trapped emotions about that,

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and I would wonder
what was going on.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, we
had this experience

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:90%
that was really incredible.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I were
at this conference.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:10%
She woke me up early on the
morning of this conference.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:10%
She never wakes me
up early, you know?

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:10%
I'm the early riser.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:10%
She woke me up early
on this conference,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.370 align:middle line:10%
and she said that
she'd had a dream.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And in her dream,
she said there were--

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:84%
she saw an order wheel
like you see in a diner.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.280 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Where the waitress takes your
order, clips it to the wheels.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:90%
She spins it around.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
The cook reads your
order and makes--

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spins it back.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --slings
your hash or whatever.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.143 align:middle line:84%
She saw this order
wheel in her dream,

00:06:32.143 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and there were three
orders on this order wheel.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And she knew that
each one of these

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
had something to do with
her health and well-being.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.310 align:middle line:90%
So this was interesting.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me
if I would help her

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.710 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what this meant.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So we started doing some
testing, muscle testing on her,

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:90%
tapping into her subconscious.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And we figured out
the first two symbols

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
were a couple of
inherited trapped emotions

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.230 align:middle line:84%
that she'd gotten
from her ancestors.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:90%
We cleared those.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And when I turned my
attention to the third order

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:84%
on this order
wheel in her dream,

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
suddenly I had what I can only
describe to you as a waking

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
vision where suddenly the room
that I was in, this hotel room,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:90%
is not there anymore.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And instead, I'm looking at this
incredibly beautiful hardwood

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:90%
floor.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.825 align:middle line:84%
Now, this looked like it had
1,000 coats of polish on it.

00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was absolutely--

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Varnished,
waved, everything?

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just so beautiful.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.985 align:middle line:84%
It's brought me to tears
before just thinking

00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:33.110 align:middle line:90%
about how beautiful it was.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen a
picture of anything close.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But as I'm seeing--
and by the way,

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.413 align:middle line:90%
this lasted for several minutes.

00:07:39.413 --> 00:07:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah, a long time.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing this.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:90%
It's in high def, 3D.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time that
I'm seeing this floor,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
I have this understanding
that comes into my mind

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:84%
that my wife's heart is
underneath this floor.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Beating.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, not so much,
but just-- it was just there.

00:08:03.078 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's like
"The Tell-Tale Heart."

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Kind of.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
what this meant.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:90%
It was bizarre, really.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And I told my wife what I
was seeing and understanding.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.360 align:middle line:84%
She had no idea what
it meant either.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So we said a prayer and
asked for some help,

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and then I started
muscle testing her,

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:84%
getting information from
her subconscious about this.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And what we found was that
when she was two years old,

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
she felt like her heart
was going to break.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At two?

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: At age two.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:84%
She grew up in a very volatile,
very dysfunctional family.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.799 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was when
she felt like her heart was

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:84%
going to break, her
subconscious mind

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
started to build a
wall around her heart.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And that wall was made
of energy, of course.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Specifically we
found it was made

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
from the energy of her emotional
baggage from trapped emotions.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we asked if we could
start to remove these.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And over two weeks'
time, we were

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.643 align:middle line:90%
able to remove all of these.

00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember how--

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I think there were 10
or 12 of these emotions.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were all from
different times in her life.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we finally cleared that
last emotion that was making up

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
this wall around her
heart, all of the sudden,

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
these feelings that she had had
for so long suddenly shifted.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
When she had that
wall, she always

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
felt like she was the odd person
out in any relationship she

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:90%
was ever in.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:84%
With friends that
she'd known for years,

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
she never really felt like she
belonged, like she was always

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:90%
the odd person out.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she built
that wall, didn't she?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.943 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: She built
it subconsciously.

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
It was put up by the
subconscious mind.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:84%
She also dealt-- she had to deal
with depression and anxiety,

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and it was hard for her
to feel positive emotions,

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:90%
easy to feel negative ones.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So when that wall was
finally taken down suddenly,

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:84%
there was an enormous
shift for her.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning
I thought, well,

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:84%
she's had some
interesting things.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she's the
only person on Earth

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
that has this kind of
phenomenon going on,

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:84%
which we came to
call the heart wall.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, about
93% of people in the world

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.730 align:middle line:90%
have this heart wall going on.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've told this story
before, but the next person--

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was the next
person that I saw this on was

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:90%
a nurse that came to see me.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.210 align:middle line:90%
She was 38 years old.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And she came to see
me for neck pain.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.083 align:middle line:84%
And she'd been to a
couple of other doctors.

00:10:27.083 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
They hadn't been
able to help her.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.840 align:middle line:90%
And so she came in to see me.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And as I was talking
with her, she

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.030 align:middle line:90%
told me that she was single.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.977 align:middle line:90%
She was 38 years old.

00:10:35.977 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:90%
She hadn't dated in eight years.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.590 align:middle line:84%
She was never going
to date again.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:90%
She was celibate.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
She was going to
die single, and she

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:90%
was very determined about that.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, gee.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.295 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of interesting.

00:10:46.295 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, why do
you feel that way?

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.430 align:middle line:84%
What brought you
to that conclusion?

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.138 align:middle line:84%
And she said that
eight years before, she

00:10:51.138 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:84%
was really deeply in
love with this guy who

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
dumped her and broke her heart.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:90%
And so that was it.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Hadn't dated since then.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So I tested her and found she
had this phenomenon, this heart

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:90%
wall phenomenon going on.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
There were three emotions, three
layers of energy, three trapped

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.405 align:middle line:84%
emotional energies
making up this wall,

00:11:09.405 --> 00:11:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and they all had to
do with the breakup

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:90%
from eight years before.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:90%
So we cleared those.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Probably took about 10 minutes.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I cleared
the last emotion,

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.153 align:middle line:84%
the neck pain
instantly was gone.

00:11:20.153 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Right?

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.790 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And she was excited
and I was excited,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and she left and didn't
come back for three months.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, emotion has a
lot to do with a lot of things,

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:90%
as you well know, Brad.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:84%
JZ Knight, the channeler, talks
about relieving past emotions.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JZ KNIGHT: How can we say that
we have lived fully every day

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:84%
by simply experiencing the
same emotions that we're

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.425 align:middle line:90%
addicted to every day?

00:11:45.425 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:90%
[CAMERA CLICKING]

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.650 align:middle line:84%
What we're actually
saying is, I have

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:84%
to reconfirm who I am
and my personality is.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:90%
I have to do this.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I have to go here.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:90%
I have to be that.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
A master is quite
a different cat.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:90%
It is one that sees the day.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:84%
It is an opportunity in
time to create avenues

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of reality and emotions that
are unborn, of realities that

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
are unborn, that the day
becomes a fertilization

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.835 align:middle line:90%
of infinite tomorrows.

00:12:24.835 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She was
on the program--

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:84%
the Gaia show "Down
the Rabbit Hole."

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:90%
And pretty poignant, isn't it?

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Absolutely is.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.637 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
about this story--

00:12:33.637 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:90%
there's a little bit more to it.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:84%
After clearing that
heart wall from her,

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see her again.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.230 align:middle line:90%
She didn't come back.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.633 align:middle line:84%
Three months later, she
walks into the office.

00:12:41.633 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered and I
said, hey, how are you?

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.190 align:middle line:84%
She said, you know,
since I was here,

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:84%
she said my neck pain
has been totally gone.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:90%
It's been fine.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But she said, you cleared
that heart wall for me,

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.918 align:middle line:90%
and that really worked.

00:12:51.918 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
She said, about two
weeks after I was here,

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.728 align:middle line:84%
I found out my
childhood sweetheart has

00:12:56.728 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:84%
been living right around
the corner from me

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.863 align:middle line:84%
for almost eight years,
and we're in love,

00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and I think he's going
to ask me to marry him.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
If you think about that and
then you multiply that story

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.630 align:middle line:84%
by thousands and thousands
around the world,

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.093 align:middle line:84%
that's what's driving the
global phenomenon really

00:13:12.093 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:90%
of "The Emotion Code."

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.410 align:middle line:84%
People are finding
out that there's

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.660 align:middle line:84%
this invisible side
of us that we're

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:84%
hauling around this
emotional baggage,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
that it can be blocking us from
really being able to connect

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
with other people and give
and receive love and create

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:90%
things, and yeah.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are these
emotions trapped within us?

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:90%
What causes that?

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well,
sometimes the emotions

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:90%
we experience are very powerful.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
overwhelming to us.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes emotions
come along and we

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:84%
decide to become really
involved with that emotion,

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and we enhance the emotion,
and we dwell on it,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and we mull over it,
and we stew over it.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And then that makes it more
likely to become trapped.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, though, another
way that we develop

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:84%
trapped emotions is when an
emotion is coming up for us,

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.820 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to go there,
and we just stuff it.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And so rather than allowing
the emotion to be felt

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and processing it, we
sometimes bury those emotions

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:84%
without allowing that
process to occur.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And so those emotions
become trapped as well.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
We all have trapped
emotions, but it's

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:90%
possible to get rid of them.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, 93% of
people have this heart wall,

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
which it's such an interesting
thing, because the heart really

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:90%
is the seat--

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And explain what
you mean by heart wall.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, let me
go back to the 1960s.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Back then, doctors first
started doing heart transplants.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:90%
You remember those days, right?

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And it was
amazing what they could do.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.828 align:middle line:84%
Well, it didn't take long before
people started coming back

00:14:42.828 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:84%
to their doctors,
relating strange things,

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:84%
that they had new taste now
in food or music or sports,

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes they would have
memories of being in places--

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.073 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From the other person.

00:14:57.073 --> 00:14:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --from
the other person.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes their handwriting
would totally change.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.762 align:middle line:84%
And in every case, when
these people were taken to

00:15:03.762 --> 00:15:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and connected to the
family of the heart donor,

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.090 align:middle line:84%
they'd find out, oh, yes,
that's our son's handwriting

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.340 align:middle line:90%
How strange is that?

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Or yes, our daughter
visited Rome every year.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And so now you have
memories of being in Rome,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and you've never in
your life visited?

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:90%
Those must be her memories.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.370 align:middle line:90%
All of those.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.037 align:middle line:84%
And there are, of
course, books written.

00:15:21.037 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And this happened
constantly, right?

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Well, not every time.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not every--

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Not every
heart transplant.

00:15:27.602 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But you know-- and sometimes
they were more minor.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Even one is dramatic.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well,
even one's dramatic.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the memories
of being in places

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:84%
where the heart donor
had been is really

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:90%
kind of crazy and fascinating.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was writing
"The Emotion Code" book,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:84%
there was a story that
came out about a man who

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:90%
had married a woman.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened
was her husband

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
had shot himself in the
head with a gun, a pistol.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to somehow
connect with this older man.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
There was about a
40-year age gap.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:84%
They carried on
this correspondence.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:84%
How she connected
with him was he

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.670 align:middle line:84%
was the recipient of
her husband's heart.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Did she know that?

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, he
started writing to her.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And so this correspondence
went on for about four years.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And they finally met
in person and he said--

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
he said the moment
I saw her in person,

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.662 align:middle line:84%
it was like I'd known
her all my life.

00:16:30.662 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't take my
eyes off of her.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up
getting married.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:84%
They were married for,
I think, eight years,

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and then he shot
himself in the head.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] It made national news.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And it never would have
except for the fact

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.160 align:middle line:90%
that there was this connection.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
many, many stories

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:84%
like this where
people have received

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:84%
energies or memories
and affinities

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:90%
and the loves of the donor.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the ancient
world, the ancient peoples

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.517 align:middle line:84%
believed the heart was
the seat of the soul,

00:17:00.517 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and the source of love and
creativity and romance,

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And in the West, we
haven't paid much attention

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
to those old ideas,
thinking that they

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.712 align:middle line:90%
were just poetic license.

00:17:09.712 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about it.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
Even today, George, if
it's Valentine's Day

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're lucky, somebody
sends you a heart-shaped box

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.519 align:middle line:90%
of something yummy, right?

00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:19.203 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: [LAUGHS]

00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:21.499 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or balloons shaped
in a heart or something.

00:17:21.499 --> 00:17:22.299 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:17:22.299 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:84%
Those symbols of the
heart are in every society

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:84%
around the world
and go back for--

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.013 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many songs have
the heart included in there too?

00:17:30.013 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well,
look at the Bible.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:84%
The Bible mentions the word
heart just shy of 1,000 times.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: And there are
scriptures, ancient scriptures

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
that say things like, well, as
a person thinks in their heart,

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:84%
so will they be, or
so will they become.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And it says that God doesn't
look on the outward appearance.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:84%
He looks on the
heart, and so on.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Now research is starting to
show that the heart really truly

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:84%
is what the ancients
believed it to be.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
There's new science
that shows the heart has

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:84%
got a lot of gray matter
and white matter in it

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.210 align:middle line:90%
like the brain.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And so it records the memories
of the things we really love.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:90%
And when scientists--

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
When scientists are
looking at the brain

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and looking at
the communications

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:84%
between the brain and the
heart, what they found

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
was that most of
the communications

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.890 align:middle line:84%
are going from the
heart to the brain.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got a clip of
you muscle testing a woman,

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:90%
talking about trapped emotions.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So is this
trapped emotion in column A?

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Just resist.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:90%
Hold it.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it in column A?

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So is it in one of the
odd rows in column A?

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Is it in Row 1, Column A?

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:37.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have abandonment,
betrayal, forlorn, and loss

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:90%
of love, and received.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.620 align:middle line:90%
So let's check this.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.522 align:middle line:90%
So this emotion, abandonment--

00:18:46.522 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:90%
is it abandonment?

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it is?

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:51.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Is it betrayal?

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.660 align:middle line:90%
Is it betrayal?

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Is it abandonment?

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Is it betrayal?

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Looks like it's
abandonment to me.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Does that ring a bell at all?

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Abandonment?

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.483 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: That does ring a bell.

00:19:07.483 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.402 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Explain what you
were doing there, Brad.

00:19:10.402 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, the subconscious
mind has these answers.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the simplest ways
to tap into the subconscious

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
is using some kind
of muscle testing.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can muscle
test yourself,

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.283 align:middle line:84%
and we teach lots of these
different methods on our site

00:19:21.283 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:90%
at discoveryhealing.com.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Or you can also
test other people,

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
was doing there.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:90%
So you can try this at home.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.860 align:middle line:84%
You can hold out an arm, have
someone hold out their arm,

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and you can ask them to make a
congruent or a true statement.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, you could hold
out your arm and you could say,

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:90%
my name is George.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And then on downward
pressure, you

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:90%
should be able to resist that.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.607 align:middle line:84%
If you were to say, my name is
Bill, that would not be true,

00:19:47.607 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and your subconscious
mind knows that,

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.513 align:middle line:84%
so your arm would tend
to go down and weaken.

00:19:51.513 --> 00:19:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who's
holding the arms out?

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:90%
The other person?

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.897 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: No you'd
hold your arm.

00:19:55.897 --> 00:19:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm doing myself.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: You want to try it?

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.100 align:middle line:90%
OK, sure.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, hold your arms
straight out then and say,

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:03.860 align:middle line:90%
my name is George.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My name is George.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I'm going
to press down.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Resist.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Hold it.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.488 align:middle line:90%
And now say, my name is Bob.

00:20:09.488 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want
me to make that up?

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, make it up.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.145 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My name is Irving.

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: OK, good.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Your name is Irving, and you
feel the difference there,

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:90%
how it just goes really weak.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.173 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What causes that?

00:20:18.173 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, the subconscious
mind can't be lied to,

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and the subconscious is
connected to the conscious.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
say something that

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:84%
is incongruent or is untrue or
negative, it weakens the body.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Just temporarily, for
about three seconds or so,

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.490 align:middle line:84%
the body will become
a little bit weaker.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.005 align:middle line:84%
So you can pick up that
change on other people,

00:20:41.005 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:84%
or you can pick
it up on yourself

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.505 align:middle line:84%
too with various different
kinds of muscle testing,

00:20:44.505 --> 00:20:45.713 align:middle line:90%
self-testing that you can do.

00:20:45.713 --> 00:20:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could do this
with people all the time.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like truth serum.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about this, OK?

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.720 align:middle line:84%
In my practice, I was obsessed
with getting to the underlying

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:90%
causes.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Why were these people sick?

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:90%
What was really going on?

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:90%
Why were they having symptoms?

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Many of them had been taking
all kinds of medications

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.240 align:middle line:90%
to try to--

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And nothing worked.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --suppress
their symptoms.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So what I found was
that the simplest way

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to access that subconscious mind
is just through muscle testing.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just a simple
way to get answers.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But boy, I'll tell you, it
can be very, very effective

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:90%
and very powerful.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you develop that?

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: No, it was
started back in the 1960s

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
by a guy named Dr.
George Goodheart, who

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:90%
was a chiropractor.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's widely used
all over the world now.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.235 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, who
discovered the heart wall?

00:21:33.235 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: We didn't
really discover it.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:90%
It was shown to us.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
It really was shown
to us from up above

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.120 align:middle line:84%
because it needed to
come into the world.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.313 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody was-- well, the
ancients practiced this, right?

00:21:44.313 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I'm sure that there's
nothing new under the sun.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think if you could
go back 2,000 or 3,000 years,

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:84%
there are probably
a lot of things

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:84%
that are going on
now that they knew,

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and they probably knew
about this kind of thing.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But in the modern era,
nobody knew about it

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:84%
until it was really
shown to my wife and I.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we put it into
"The Emotion Code" book.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the heart
like a second brain?

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: It absolutely
is a second brain.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that the
brains that are in our heads

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:10%
are following the
messages that are

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:10%
being sent by the brain
that's in our hearts.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
The problem, though, is that
when you've got a heart wall--

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and remember that nine out
of 10 people have this.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:24.830 align:middle line:90%
They've put up this wall.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
It makes it much more difficult
for you to really create--

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:84%
to express the
best creative ideas

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that are within you,
which really lie,

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I believe, within the heart.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Let me share a story
with you that's

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.950 align:middle line:84%
so interesting, because this
can affect even children.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:44.055 align:middle line:84%
This is a story that came in
not too long ago from Italy.

00:22:44.055 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:84%
This woman said, the
most exciting case

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I have witnessed while
using the emotion code

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:84%
is the story of a
two-year-old boy named Seb.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Since his birth,
he had experienced

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.420 align:middle line:84%
two deaths of close family
members important to him,

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:84%
the death of his father and
that of his mother's sister,

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:84%
both who died
following an accident.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:84%
The child was continually
looking for his mother.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:84%
He would not leave her side
even to sleep at night.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.140 align:middle line:84%
He was terrified
of losing her too.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Within a few hours of
releasing trapped emotions

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and removing his
heart wall, the child

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:84%
began to laugh, rejoice,
and show signs of happiness

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:90%
as he had never done before.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.600 align:middle line:84%
His mother was amazed
at the dramatic change.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Now he can play
away from his mother

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.093 align:middle line:84%
without the constant
fear of losing her too.

00:23:25.093 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:84%
The mother says she
witnessed a miracle.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was from Valeria
Zuccaru in Piacenza in Italy.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.675 align:middle line:84%
And we have so, so
many of these stories.

00:23:33.675 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:90%
They come in all the time--

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:35.690 align:middle line:90%
They just--

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: --from
all over the world.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constant.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:90%
Constant.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joe Dispenza--
you've heard of Dr. Joe--

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.637 align:middle line:84%
talks about trapped emotions
and what they do to the brain.

00:23:44.637 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JOE DISPENZA: Ultimately,
the brain becomes hardwired.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And then to think
outside the box the way

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:84%
those neurons are
connected really

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.900 align:middle line:84%
takes quite an enormous
amount of effort,

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.750 align:middle line:84%
because it challenges
your own personal beliefs

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:90%
and perceptions.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
It challenges your
relationships with other people.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:84%
It challenges even your
emotional agreements.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And so people have agreements
with people and things

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:90%
and places and times and events.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And all those agreements
have some chemical makeup

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:84%
that supports who they are as
an individual, as an identity,

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:90%
as a personality.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's
pretty fascinating too.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yes, and so true.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that what these
trapped emotions do, you see,

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:84%
they affect us in a
couple of different ways.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:84%
They affect us physically,
because a trapped emotion

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:90%
is a ball of energy.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the
body's an energy field.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got a
ball of resentment

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.170 align:middle line:84%
or a ball of anger
or grief or something

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.110 align:middle line:84%
that's in the body
somewhere, what's going on

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:46.280 align:middle line:84%
is that that ball
of emotional energy,

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:84%
we believe it's continually
distorting the normal energy

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:90%
field of the body.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.818 align:middle line:84%
So it's interfering
with the blood flow

00:24:52.818 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:90%
to some degree, the lymph flow.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:84%
It's interfering with all the
chemical reactions taking place

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:84%
within that little
sphere of tissue.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when we
remove a trapped emotion,

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:05.240 align:middle line:84%
suddenly that distorting
force that was there

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:90%
is suddenly gone.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why so
many people have

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
found that when that
emotional baggage is removed,

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:84%
physical pain disappears
or is greatly improved.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.695 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen this
countless times,

00:25:17.695 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing it
all over the world.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.987 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, remember
that old saying.

00:25:20.987 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So-and-so died of
a broken heart.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: And that's also true.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course, science
now recognizes that.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.250 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese really
first discovered that.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting about that.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:84%
They found that sometimes, women
especially over the age of 55,

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
if they went through a
really intense, traumatic,

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.380 align:middle line:90%
emotional event--

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stressful

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yes-- that their
heart would sometimes fail.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And they found that when they
X-rayed a woman, especially

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
like this, at that moment that
the heart, instead of looking

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
like a heart, would look
like a bell-shaped jar

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.560 align:middle line:84%
that the Japanese fishermen
called a takotsubo.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a jar they put on
the bottom of the ocean

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.498 align:middle line:90%
to catch octopus.

00:26:04.498 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And the heart-- and
I've seen these X-rays,

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and it absolutely looks exactly
like that bell-shaped jar.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
creates that shape?

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.013 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, what's happening
is the heart is failing

00:26:13.013 --> 00:26:14.820 align:middle line:90%
and the heart is dying.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:90%
The heart is--

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:90%
And so yes.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Even Western medicine,
they refer to it

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:24.492 align:middle line:84%
as cardiac syndrome, that you
can die from a broken heart.

00:26:24.492 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we've
heard stories too, though,

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.970 align:middle line:84%
when somebody, Brad,
dies of a broken heart,

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and their wife just died,
and they die a day later.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Right.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a football
player for Boston--

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.618 align:middle line:90%
Doug Flutie.

00:26:40.618 --> 00:26:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The quarterback.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.993 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah, the quarterback.

00:26:42.993 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, great quarterback back
in, I think, in the '70s.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And his father died
of a heart attack.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So he's in the hospital
room with his mother.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.040 align:middle line:84%
His father's been dead
for about an hour.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.330 align:middle line:90%
They're in the room.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:00.020 align:middle line:84%
His mother leans over to
give her husband a kiss

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.770 align:middle line:90%
on the forehead and she dies.

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:03.470 align:middle line:90%
She just--

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She dies.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.967 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: She dies.

00:27:05.967 --> 00:27:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think that-- yeah, she
just collapses and is gone.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So he lost both of his parents
in the space of an hour,

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:13.862 align:middle line:84%
but I think she definitely
died of a broken heart.

00:27:13.862 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
she could have had

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
some blockage or something like
that, but who knows, right?

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.107 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Well, who knows?

00:27:20.107 --> 00:27:22.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you feel like you're
having a heart attack,

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:23.690 align:middle line:90%
by all means, call 911.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:90%
Go to the hospital.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.142 align:middle line:90%
But if they tell you--

00:27:26.142 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Take a baby aspirin.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to the
hospital and they tell you

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
that there was really nothing
wrong with your heart,

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:39.290 align:middle line:84%
then you may be on the road
to dying from a broken heart.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
for sure, but we

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.300 align:middle line:84%
believe that when that
wall is taken down,

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.120 align:middle line:84%
that heart wall is
taken down, that it

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:84%
lessens your chances
greatly for actually

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.083 align:middle line:90%
having that happen to you.

00:27:53.083 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think
that's absolutely true.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the heart
is an incredible--

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:84%
are there any other organs
within the body that have

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:90%
that kind of emotional feeling?

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, the
heart is very unique,

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:84%
and it really is, I believe,
the source of creativity,

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.920 align:middle line:84%
the core of our being,
the seat of the soul.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:90%
All of those things.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.738 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, the
liver doesn't do it.

00:28:15.738 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:90%
The kidneys don't do it.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.615 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: No, the
heart is really unique.

00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:90%
It's incredibly unique.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only
other organ that

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.710 align:middle line:84%
has gray matter and white matter
in it like the brain does.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, the brain is
made of gray and white matter.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was not until
the 1970s that doctors

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.060 align:middle line:84%
started to find out
that the heart had

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.560 align:middle line:84%
this gray matter
and white matter

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:84%
in it, that there was
more than it should have.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
last 10 or 20 years,

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.630 align:middle line:84%
they've made more
discoveries about that.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So the heart is
really a second brain.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And the best creative
ideas that you'll ever have

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:84%
will really come
from that brain.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.795 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens to us is
when we put up a wall, when

00:29:00.795 --> 00:29:03.170 align:middle line:84%
we're crying ourselves to
sleep at night when we're kids,

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.837 align:middle line:84%
or we're listening
to our parents argue,

00:29:04.837 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:84%
or someone dies, or we
go through a divorce,

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:13.010 align:middle line:84%
or any of a whole variety of
different things happen to us,

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:18.180 align:middle line:84%
we end up putting up this
wall around the heart.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And when that wall is there, it
makes it more difficult for you

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.490 align:middle line:84%
to really connect
with other people.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And love, see, is not only a
verb, but it's also an energy.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're sending love
from one person to another,

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
when you're trying
to receive love

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and you've got that
wall there, it's

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.830 align:middle line:90%
a blockage that's in the way.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's not unusual
at all for people

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:46.850 align:middle line:84%
when that wall is taken
down to fall in love

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:50.033 align:middle line:84%
even at advanced
ages, to feel joy

00:29:50.033 --> 00:29:51.450 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
in their lives.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:56.297 align:middle line:84%
In fact, sometimes to feel
connected with a higher power.

00:29:56.297 --> 00:29:57.380 align:middle line:90%
Here's an interesting one.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when you
have a heart wall,

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.910 align:middle line:84%
you're not as able
to feel what's

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:06.620 align:middle line:84%
going on in your
dysfunctional relationship.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.148 align:middle line:90%
I've seen this before.

00:30:08.148 --> 00:30:09.065 align:middle line:90%
This is a testimonial.

00:30:09.065 --> 00:30:10.292 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you blocked?

00:30:10.292 --> 00:30:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yeah,
you're just blocked

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.458 align:middle line:84%
from being able to
really feel-- you see,

00:30:13.458 --> 00:30:15.110 align:middle line:90%
we feel with this brain.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:90%
We don't feel with this brain.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
reasons, George, why

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I think the world is in so
much trouble, because think

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:21.470 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Here we are in the 21st century,
and by and large, we still

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:84%
think that it's OK to use
war to settle differences

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.170 align:middle line:90%
between nations.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's coming from this
brain, which feels nothing.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.250 align:middle line:90%
This brain is where we feel.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:90%
So here's a story.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Listen to this.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.548 align:middle line:84%
After my heart
wall was removed, I

00:30:39.548 --> 00:30:41.090 align:middle line:84%
saw much more clearly
what was really

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:45.410 align:middle line:84%
happening to me and around
me in my bad marriage.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I left my comfort zone,
separated from my husband.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Since then, I've been free.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:50.960 align:middle line:90%
I have no more self-doubts.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm creative again,
and I go through life

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:54.170 align:middle line:84%
in a friendly and
courageous manner.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.450 align:middle line:84%
I can feel love again
and give and receive love

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:57.260 align:middle line:90%
unconditionally.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.225 align:middle line:90%
It's just wonderful.

00:30:58.225 --> 00:31:00.350 align:middle line:84%
My children have noticed
how I have changed and are

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.900 align:middle line:84%
enthusiastic about how our
relationship with one another

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.948 align:middle line:84%
has become much more
loving and close and even

00:31:04.948 --> 00:31:05.990 align:middle line:90%
raised to a higher level.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.907 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful gift.

00:31:06.907 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:84%
That's from Katrin from
Reichenschwand in Germany.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.793 align:middle line:90%
So there are lots of these.

00:31:13.793 --> 00:31:14.960 align:middle line:90%
One of the exciting things--

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:90%
I've got to read you one more.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.150 align:middle line:84%
This is from a guy named
Giacomo Revele in London.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:19.310 align:middle line:90%
He said--

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did you
get these, by the way?

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: These
come in every day.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.340 align:middle line:90%
We get loads of these.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I had my assistant
just pull up some

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.500 align:middle line:90%
of these for the interview.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, after my heart
wall was released,

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.170 align:middle line:90%
my life completely changed.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I became far more
open to the divine

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.563 align:middle line:90%
and I started lucid dreaming.

00:31:35.563 --> 00:31:36.980 align:middle line:84%
After a few months,
I entered into

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:39.800 align:middle line:84%
my first long-term relationship
with an amazing partner

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.295 align:middle line:90%
in which I'm very happy.

00:31:41.295 --> 00:31:42.920 align:middle line:84%
See, that's all about
the heart, right?

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you get a heart-shaped
box of chocolates,

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:84%
there's deep symbolism
there that has

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:50.008 align:middle line:90%
to do with who we really are.

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:52.550 align:middle line:84%
At first, I thought I wanted to
pursue a completely different

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:53.060 align:middle line:90%
profession.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:55.457 align:middle line:84%
But after one month, my
resolve for my current passion

00:31:55.457 --> 00:31:58.040 align:middle line:84%
strengthened and I'm achieving
better results than ever in it.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So grateful that I
discovered the heart wall

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:90%
and had it released.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the beautiful
things about "The Emotion

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Code" and the heart wall is
that you can do this yourself.

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:08.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we have--

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:09.778 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's easy, isn't it?

00:32:09.778 --> 00:32:10.903 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: It's pretty easy.

00:32:10.903 --> 00:32:11.743 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, actually.

00:32:11.743 --> 00:32:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once
you're in that mode.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.702 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yeah, you
learn the process

00:32:14.702 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:84%
of how it works to find and
release those trapped emotions.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And then it's simple to do,
and people are doing it.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And kids are doing it
and having great results,

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.442 align:middle line:90%
actually, so that's kind of fun.

00:32:27.442 --> 00:32:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's exciting.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Does science look at
the heart and say, aha,

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:90%
this is where emotion is?

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: No, not really.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think they
will eventually.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But you see, what
we have found is

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.370 align:middle line:84%
that if you go back far
enough in acupuncture,

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:45.870 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Chinese
medicine, they

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.828 align:middle line:84%
believed that the organs
and some of the glands

00:32:47.828 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:90%
produce the emotions.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And we find that
that's true too.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's a connection
with peptides and the brain

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and so on, but there's also
this energetic side of it

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.340 align:middle line:84%
where every emotion
is a frequency that

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:84%
is being produced by a
certain organ or gland.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And it ties in with
the five element theory

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:90%
in Chinese medicine, and so on.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the
heart, of course,

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.350 align:middle line:84%
produces certain
emotions, but the liver

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:90%
produces other emotions.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:84%
The kidneys produce
other emotions.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Yeah, for example,
the kidneys and the bladder,

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:84%
one of the prime
emotions that's produced

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.950 align:middle line:84%
by the kidneys and the
bladder is actually

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.870 align:middle line:90%
the emotion of fear, OK?

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:31.430 align:middle line:90%
That connects to the kidneys.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And another emotion
is-- we call it peeved,

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.645 align:middle line:84%
which is just the polite
way of saying pissed off.

00:33:38.645 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Think about the connection
there, the kidneys

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:90%
and the bladder, right?

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.380 align:middle line:84%
In the liver, the
prime emotion is anger.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think about
people, for example, who drink

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and who become angry, there's
a lot of people in jails

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:54.110 align:middle line:90%
right now that were drinking.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:57.900 align:middle line:84%
When you drink, you're
overstimulating the liver.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you drink a lot, you
can really overstimulate it,

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and then it will
tend to produce maybe

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.770 align:middle line:84%
some of those emotions
like anger and resentment,

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:04.570 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:05.540 align:middle line:90%
And so then--

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then it sends
it to the brain, or what?

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yep.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:84%
Goes to the brain, and
then people sometimes

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:13.400 align:middle line:90%
act out on those emotions.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's a fascinating thing.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's all in
"The Emotion Code."

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.150 align:middle line:90%
We detail all these connections.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.159 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dr. Daniel
Monti explains

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:24.770 align:middle line:84%
what you can do
to start releasing

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:27.530 align:middle line:84%
your trapped emotions
on the program

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.370 align:middle line:90%
"Down the Quantum Rabbit Hole."

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIEL MONTI: So if
somebody is characteristically

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:37.659 align:middle line:84%
responding in the same
way over and over again

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and that person wants to
change the way that they're

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:84%
responding, it requires
looking at the problem

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.870 align:middle line:90%
on several different levels.

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it requires
understanding

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that emotional
pattern and connecting

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.390 align:middle line:84%
the parts of the
nervous system that

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:02.860 align:middle line:84%
are about emotional survival
and cognitive appraisal,

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.453 align:middle line:84%
and working through the
emotional stuckness.

00:35:06.453 --> 00:35:08.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why I suppose there's
so many different types

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:90%
of therapies.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.340 align:middle line:84%
There's therapies
that are geared more

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:84%
at looking at emotions, more
at looking at cognitions,

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:19.750 align:middle line:84%
more looking at
behavioral ways you

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.980 align:middle line:84%
can help yourself to
get out of a pattern.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:26.950 align:middle line:84%
But I think, again, looking
at the human organism

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:84%
as every living system,
as an integrated whole

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.660 align:middle line:84%
that if there are ways of
integrating cognition, emotion,

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:40.420 align:middle line:84%
behavior, physiology in
your approach to change,

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.610 align:middle line:84%
then that's what's ultimately
going to be most helpful.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are a variety
of techniques that

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:90%
can help a person to do that.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's amazing
is you're getting this

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.960 align:middle line:84%
from another doctor,
so it seems like it's

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.470 align:middle line:90%
starting to fester and grow.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Well, I think it is.

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.460 align:middle line:90%
It's inevitable, really.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.710 align:middle line:84%
We are living now in
what I like to call

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:84%
the age of the heart,
because it's time

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.660 align:middle line:84%
for us as a civilization,
as humanity to wake

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:11.260 align:middle line:84%
up to the fact of
who we really are

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:16.135 align:middle line:84%
and what these bodies really
are, and how they work,

00:36:16.135 --> 00:36:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and to wake up to the true
nature of our energetic makeup.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.187 align:middle line:90%
Listen to one more of these.

00:36:22.187 --> 00:36:23.020 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.353 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You love these stories.

00:36:24.353 --> 00:36:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: I love these stories.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:27.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a woman named
Chandra from Idaho.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.835 align:middle line:84%
She wrote, and she said, as
a victim of domestic violence

00:36:29.835 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:90%
all my life, I had a heart wall.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.485 align:middle line:84%
I did not know you
could feel your heart.

00:36:34.485 --> 00:36:36.610 align:middle line:84%
After my heart wall was
cleared, for the first time

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I could actually feel
my heart beating.

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:90%
It was so emotional.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.985 align:middle line:84%
I felt happy joy, peace,
and so much love coming in.

00:36:42.985 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't stop the
happy tears from flowing.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.360 align:middle line:84%
It was like a dam
bursting I never

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.092 align:middle line:84%
knew such joy could
be in one's life.

00:36:48.092 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Now think about this, George.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.383 align:middle line:84%
Nine out of 10 people
listening to this show right

00:36:51.383 --> 00:36:54.850 align:middle line:84%
now have a wall
that's been put up.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:55.962 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By themselves.

00:36:55.962 --> 00:36:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: By their
own subconscious mind,

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:84%
from the stuff that
they've gone through.

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they may be in
an unhappy situation

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.410 align:middle line:90%
with their relationship.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:06.280 align:middle line:90%
They may be single.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.450 align:middle line:90%
They might be alone.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:11.590 align:middle line:84%
You might be wondering,
how can I create the life

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:13.420 align:middle line:90%
that I'm capable of creating?

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you,
the perfect blueprint, I

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:84%
think, for the life that you can
create lies within your heart.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
heart wall, then it

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.360 align:middle line:84%
becomes much more
difficult to manifest that.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And when that wall
is taken down,

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.350 align:middle line:84%
suddenly things can
start to flow for you

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:31.300 align:middle line:90%
in a very spontaneous way.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is a heart wall like
a shield that they put up?

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: It is.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like your subconscious mind
moves your heart into a bunker

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:90%
when the bombs are falling.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:43.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're in an
abusive relationship

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.310 align:middle line:84%
or you're going
through a divorce

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:48.440 align:middle line:84%
or you've got a
bad job situation.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.358 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, you
build up that wall,

00:37:51.358 --> 00:37:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's a way to
protect your heart.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart really is
the core of our being, right?

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So we want to protect
it subconsciously,

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.600 align:middle line:90%
so we put up this wall.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The problem is once
that wall is put up,

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:06.730 align:middle line:84%
when the bombs stop falling,
you've still got this wall,

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and your heart is
still now in a bunker.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So you want to try to
connect with other people

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:13.437 align:middle line:84%
and you want to fall
in love or stay in love

00:38:13.437 --> 00:38:15.520 align:middle line:84%
or have a better relationship
or create your life,

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.800 align:middle line:84%
but your heart's
inside of a wall.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.620 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite stories is
from one of our practitioners

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:25.030 align:middle line:84%
who had a sister who'd been
divorced for nine years,

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.920 align:middle line:90%
and hadn't dated in nine years.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And her sister called her up
one day and she said, listen.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.810 align:middle line:84%
She said, I've been
alone now for nine years.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired of being alone.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:35.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting older.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to find somebody that
I can share my life with.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And so she said, would you
come over and work on me?

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And so her sister, one
of our practitioners,

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.060 align:middle line:84%
came over, worked on her,
cleared her heart wall.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, neither one of them told
anyone that they had done this.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.650 align:middle line:90%
They did it on a weekend.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.820 align:middle line:84%
The following Monday, the
phone started to ring.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.318 align:middle line:84%
It was guys that had
known her years before--

00:38:59.318 --> 00:39:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out of the blue.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Out of the blue.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:02.770 align:middle line:90%
How could that happen?

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, we're living
in this sea of energy.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake calls
it the morphic field.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.130 align:middle line:90%
It goes by lots of names.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:12.148 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The matrix.

00:39:12.148 --> 00:39:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: The matrix, the
universal intelligence.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you want to call it.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which we're
all connected to.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: We're all
totally connected.

00:39:17.583 --> 00:39:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And it makes perfect sense if
you understand quantum physics.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So when all of the sudden
her heart wall was gone

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and that heart of
hers were starting

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:84%
to send out this message
that, hey, I'm available--

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.142 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: [LAUGHS] These
guys were receptive.

00:39:29.142 --> 00:39:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: The phone
starts to ring.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I think it was three different
guys called her that week.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.618 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is magical.

00:39:34.618 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: [LAUGHS] It is.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You put it out.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.990 align:middle line:90%
What you put out, it comes back.

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Absolutely.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Is it science or something else?

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I think it's a
higher level of science.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.960 align:middle line:84%
It has more to do really
with quantum physics,

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.220 align:middle line:90%
with quantum mechanics.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.960 align:middle line:84%
If you understand quantum
physics and quantum mechanics,

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.240 align:middle line:90%
then--

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.280 align:middle line:90%
and that's a strange world, OK?

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand it, then
it all makes perfect sense.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.610 align:middle line:90%
It's far from Newtonian physics.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:08.740 align:middle line:84%
It's far from the old
ways of looking at things.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.350 align:middle line:90%
But it is the new science.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It is the new technology that
is going to change the world.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:13.800 align:middle line:90%
It's inevitable.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question about it.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:16.620 align:middle line:84%
What are your new
projects, Brad?

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, we're
working on a book about--

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:84%
"The Body Code," and we hope
to have that out in 2022.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did COVID do to
emotions of the heart wall?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: Well, I think it's
been a setback for a lot

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:38.790 align:middle line:84%
of people around the world,
because the way that I look

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:43.860 align:middle line:84%
at it, George, the emotional
baggage that a person has can

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.540 align:middle line:90%
be likened to the glass--

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.060 align:middle line:90%
to the water in a glass, OK?

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got a lot
of emotional baggage

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're already close to
the top, when COVID comes along

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and lockdowns and
everything else,

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:02.380 align:middle line:84%
then you don't have any room
for that emotional baggage,

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.180 align:middle line:90%
any new baggage.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It can't go anywhere.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.658 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: So it
starts to overflow.

00:41:05.658 --> 00:41:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And so what we are
finding is that when

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:84%
people start to work on
their emotional baggage

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and they start to get rid
of those trapped emotions,

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.400 align:middle line:84%
they're starting to
empty that glass.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And so then they're able
to deal with things.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.730 align:middle line:90%
They're able to deal with life.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.640 align:middle line:84%
We can be at peace in
spite of what's going

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.470 align:middle line:90%
on in the world around us.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:29.640 align:middle line:84%
But the more emotional
baggage we get rid of,

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.250 align:middle line:84%
the easier it is
to feel that peace.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to tell
you an interesting story.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:38.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a neighbor in our
subdivision in St. Louis who

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.260 align:middle line:90%
people call Crabby Appleton.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Uh-huh.

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's just
angry about everything.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.170 align:middle line:84%
The guy ended up
having a heart attack.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Yeah.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think his anger
created that heart attack.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.780 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I think
it's very possible.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:56.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, I had a
patient years ago

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.600 align:middle line:84%
that came in to
see me who thought

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.660 align:middle line:90%
she was having a heart attack.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.670 align:middle line:90%
She was in the middle of this.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.830 align:middle line:84%
She had crushing chest
pain, difficulty breathing.

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Her left arm was totally numb.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Left side of her face was numb.

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.810 align:middle line:84%
You probably thought
she was having one.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: I thought she
was having a heart attack.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:09.660 align:middle line:90%
But I told my staff, stand by.

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.220 align:middle line:90%
We might need an ambulance.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.683 align:middle line:84%
But let me test
her really quickly.

00:42:12.683 --> 00:42:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I did, and I found
she had a trapped emotion.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.500 align:middle line:90%
The emotion was grief.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And within about a minute,
I had figured this out,

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that this had occurred
three years before.

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I arrived at that, she
burst into tears and she said,

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.717 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
that's affecting me.

00:42:26.717 --> 00:42:28.050 align:middle line:90%
I thought I dealt with all that.

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
in the world happened?

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:31.020 align:middle line:84%
She said that three
years before, her husband

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:31.920 align:middle line:90%
was having an affair.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And she found out about it
and confronted him about it,

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and the marriage blew up, and
they ended up getting divorced.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And she had spent
about a year in therapy

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:45.222 align:middle line:84%
dealing with it mentally and had
even gotten recently remarried.

00:42:45.222 --> 00:42:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And so as far as
she was concerned,

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that was her ex, and
that was all history.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.182 align:middle line:84%
But as far as her
body was concerned,

00:42:50.182 --> 00:42:52.440 align:middle line:84%
that energy was
right there still.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:56.055 align:middle line:84%
And when I released that by just
passing a magnet or my hand--

00:42:56.055 --> 00:42:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember-- down
the back a few times,

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:01.180 align:middle line:84%
down the governing meridian,
all of a sudden, whoom.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:01.980 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.147 align:middle line:84%
The feeling came back into
her arm and into her face

00:43:04.147 --> 00:43:05.340 align:middle line:90%
just within seconds.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Pain, the difficulty
breathing, it was all gone.

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And she left the
office 10 minutes later

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:11.923 align:middle line:90%
feeling totally fine.

00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:12.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about this.

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dramatic.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Think about this.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.720 align:middle line:90%
That woman is still alive.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Her name is Debbie, and
she lives in Oregon.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.570 align:middle line:90%
She has a horse ranch.

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:24.820 align:middle line:10%
And I think if we had not
found that and removed that--

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.230 align:middle line:10%
that was probably
30-some years--

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.480 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: She'd by dead by now.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.147 align:middle line:84%
>>NELSON: She'd
probably be dead by now.

00:43:29.147 --> 00:43:31.438 align:middle line:84%
She probably would have
died of heart failure.

00:43:31.438 --> 00:43:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Would have been a broken heart.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:34.520 align:middle line:10%
And the fascinating
thing is that it

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.020 align:middle line:10%
would have been her husband's
affair really that killed her,

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.190 align:middle line:10%
but nobody would
have really known.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:39.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nobody
would have known.

00:43:39.565 --> 00:43:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Can we as individuals bring
this heart wall down on our own?

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: You absolutely can.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.365 align:middle line:84%
The instructions are all
in "The Emotion Code" book.

being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NELSON: Thank you, George.

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here with you.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.905 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fascinating
research and work.

00:43:57.905 --> 00:44:00.180 align:middle line:10%
The heart really is a brain.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.940 align:middle line:10%
It has emotion, and it shows.

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:03.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."
