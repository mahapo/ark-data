>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to this edition

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.490 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:10%
And we've got a great program
in store for you today.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:10%
Our special guest is someone
who's been on our radio program

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:10%
quite often, David Sereda.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.140 align:middle line:84%
David is a mystic,
but he's a producer.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:90%
He's a director.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:84%
He investigates a
lot of the unknown.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:84%
David, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

after how many shows?

00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:43.032 align:middle line:10%

>>NOORY: You will
have brought us

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
something kind of
intriguing, which we're going

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:90%
to talk about in just a second.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.010 align:middle line:84%
It's what you call the
Staff of Moses, basically.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: The Staff of Moses,
Isis, and all of the prophets

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
coming forward to Jesus
actually being a staff holder,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:84%
the 12 disciples
being staff holders,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
then going forward to
Merlin and the 12 knights

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:90%
of the roundtable.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Their staffs become swords.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:10%
But the secret is in the length
and the frequency of the staff.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is
made out of metal.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:10%
>>SEREDA: This is made out
of brass which is probably--

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:10%
the Staff of Moses, according
to the ancient Kabbalah,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.730 align:middle line:10%
it comes from the
Garden of Eden.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And God creates it on the
sixth day of the creation

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle line:90%
in their mythology.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes
through the prophets.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:84%
From Enoch would have
been the first prophet who

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
was taken in a whirlwind and was
actually taken aboard a crystal

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
spaceship where he meets God,
the God of the ancient Hebrews.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So God creates the Staff
and gives it to him.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes
through Abraham.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.853 align:middle line:84%
It goes to Isaac,
goes to Joseph.

00:01:49.853 --> 00:01:51.020 align:middle line:90%
The Joseph of ancient Egypt.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just handed
it down to each other?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: And they always had
12 staffs for the 12 tribe

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Staff lays in the
Ark of the Covenant, which

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:90%
is the secret to its power--

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: --how
it gets recharged

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and how it acts as a distributed
antenna to keep all of the 12

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.958 align:middle line:84%
in constant communication
with each other and with God.

00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I always
thought the Staff was just

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:90%
a piece of wood.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.250 align:middle line:90%
It was not, I guess.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: It actually
contained 10 sapphires.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
10 sapphires, like this would
be the head of the Staff here.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And this actually
has 10 sapphires.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:90%
You can hold that in your hand.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.290 align:middle line:84%
You can see it on the other
side with the 10 sapphires

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:90%
on the top.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And the sapphires, what's
interesting about sapphires

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
is NASA uses lab grown
sapphires and rubies for masers.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And what a maser does is it
benefits radio astronomy,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
because it purifies the bands of
microwaves for radio astronomy.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting when you
attach sapphires and gems

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
to an antenna,
but we think of it

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
more of as a royalty symbol
when actually it's an antenna.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's look at
your explanation of the Staff

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:90%
as an antenna.

that the Staff of Moses, Aaron,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:10%
Jesus, Muhammad Merlin,
and Arthur, as well as

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:10%
divine feminine prophetess
as such as Isis, Sarah,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.260 align:middle line:10%
Mary Magdalene, and more,
that their staffs were

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:10%
used as an electrical
antenna designed

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:10%
to amplify the electricity
of the human nervous system

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:10%
into a divine radio
signal, telepathy to God.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Doing a simple
experiment, when we

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
get a weak signal
on the radio and we

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
place our hands on the
antenna, the signal

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.169 align:middle line:90%

I've seen it raining

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:84%
- This is scientific
proof that we

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
are likened to an antenna
that receives messages

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:90%
from the beyond.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:84%
It was proven by German
physicist Fritz-Albert Popp

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that the human DNA transmits
and receives radio waves.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
This proves the hypothesis
that humans can interface

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:90%
with radio frequency antennas.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:84%
For the Staff of Legends
we are speaking of

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
to be an actual antenna,
we have to know its length.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
With the exact length, we can
determine the radio frequency

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:90%
of the gods.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:10%
This is because the
height of an antenna,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:10%
using positive and
negative charge today,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:10%
is equal to half a wavelength.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
The length of the
antenna or staff times 2

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:90%
equals a full wavelength.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
The frequency of an
antenna is calculated

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:90%
with a simple formula--

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:84%
the speed of light in inches
divided by the full wavelength

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:90%
of the antenna.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So if we know the length
of the Staff of Moses

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and the other
legends in inches, we

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:84%
can know the frequency
they used to talk to God.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
What a great revelation
this could be.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.106 align:middle line:90%

>>NOORY: David, did Moses
know the power of the Staff

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.795 align:middle line:90%
or was he just using it?

00:05:39.795 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Well,
the way it starts

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
with the prophets is
they herd the sheep

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:90%
and they bond with it first.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:90%
So when you start--

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:90%
if I hold this.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.483 align:middle line:84%
And this staff
here is plugged in.

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's pretty
heavy, too, by the way.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: It's pretty heavy.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine him
walking around with this,

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
because Moses' Staff,
according to legend,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:90%
had the 10 sapphires.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And it would probably be
a conductor like brass,

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:90%
because the Egyptians had brass.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Or it could have been even
gold, because gold is actually

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:90%
the best conductor.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Right?

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as I hold this staff,
because I have electricity

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
in my nervous system, we can
measure voltage and current

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
on our fingertips
and our earlobes.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And any electrical system,
such as the human body is,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.180 align:middle line:84%
that has resistance
means it has an aura.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It means it has
a magnetic field.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So scientists who say that
the human body doesn't

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.305 align:middle line:90%
have an aura--

00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean a lot of
them tell me this

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
because I've worked with
classical physicists--

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're wrong.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.892 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: You're wrong,
because if you have resistance,

00:06:36.892 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:90%
you have an aura.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you hold this staff,
George, just for a second.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:90%
What starts to happen--

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to demonstrate on
this radio frequency reader--

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.477 align:middle line:90%
that you are actually--

00:06:49.477 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the alarm
on this thing go off.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:90%
I'll turn the volume up.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm going to hold it?

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: No.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
You can't hold it because you'll
become part of the circuit.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: See the meter even on
your hands here is going crazy.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Now if you let go of
the Staff and then we

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
put the meter near you,
it's not doing anything.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.740 align:middle line:90%
The needle is going to nowhere.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: So as soon as you
plug into a charged staff,

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
you are now part of
the antenna which

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:90%
is expanding your actual aura.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So your aura is getting
bigger which means

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:90%
your telepathy is increasing.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But because we know
that this staff--

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:84%
because it's a monopole staff--
times four the speed of light

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.480 align:middle line:84%
in inches divided
by this in inches--

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
if you know the correct
inches for the Staff of Moses,

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:84%
then you have the
frequency that Moses

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and the prophets used
to communicate with God.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:90%
And possibly, God is in--

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
what the prophets tell us from
Ezekiel and the giant wheels

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and what the Book of
Enoch tells us-- is God

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
was traveling in this
big crystal spaceship.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.580 align:middle line:84%
We're assuming
that we're dealing

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:90%
with an extraterrestrial here.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Beyond Earth, right?

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
A god that is above and
observing the earth from above.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So right now, I have
the sacred frequency

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid capstone
base going through your body

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And so what's
happening is if you

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
take the capstone of
the Great Pyramid,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:84%
the unfinished platform, it's
572 point something inches

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.450 align:middle line:90%
times four sides.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And the theory that the
pyramid is a giant crystal

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
oscillator generating
electromagnetic signals--

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Basically.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: What's that?

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.108 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A power plant.

00:08:32.108 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: A power plant to
generate frequencies not

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.200 align:middle line:90%
to light a light bulb.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:84%
What people call the
Dendera light bulb,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I believe was an
inductor transmitter.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:90%
So it has a cord.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:84%
The Dendera light
bulb has a cord.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And it has these giant humans,
gods, holding the wand.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:84%
What I believe the Dendera
was is an actual wand.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And you see these small
humans holding hands

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:84%
in kind of ceremony
underneath it.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is if
this was a giant light bulb,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:90%
they would all be blinded.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That bright.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: It would
be too bright.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:84%
So what I believe
they're doing is

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:84%
they're doing exactly what
I'm doing to you right now is

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:84%
they're inducting sacred
frequencies into the recipients

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:84%
to activate the Kundalini of
their own spiritual antenna.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now is this
what Moses used,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.250 align:middle line:90%
David, to part the Red Sea?

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: See?

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So what I am saying
in this thesis

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.890 align:middle line:90%
is because the Staff is--

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
we know in Hebrews
9:4 in the Bible

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that the Staff lay inside
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And we know in Numbers
17 in the books of Moses,

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.270 align:middle line:84%
that the Staff was
proportional to the Ark.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So if we know the
length of the Ark,

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.228 align:middle line:90%
we know the length of the Staff.

00:09:51.228 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It fit right in there.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: It would
fit right in there.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But it would mean it's
the same frequency

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:90%
as the Ark of the Covenant.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great,
great secret here.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if the Ark
of the Covenant

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
was theoretically an
electrical capacitor

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and it belonged inside
of the Great Pyramid--

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:90%
which I can fulfill and prove--

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:84%
then it acted as the charge
in the pyramid in the King's

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Chamber to activate
the electrons

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.850 align:middle line:84%
to spin in square waves all the
way up and down the pyramid.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Without the Staff.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: But no, the
Staffs were inside the Ark,

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:90%
because that was the charge.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you didn't have the
Staff there, what would happen?

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Then you would
have no charge in the Ark.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: You see--

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you need this.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: The theory is if you
have the stones, the tablets,

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
in the Ark, if they were
made of a radioactive granite

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:84%
like you find in
Egypt, they would

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:90%
emit an ionizing radiation.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And the radiation would
get trapped in the Ark.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And therefore the Ark would
have a certain amount of power.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:84%
But with the rods, with the 12
staffs of Moses, Aaron, and--

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like this.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Like this,
with the sapphires,

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:84%
then the Ark of the Covenant
would be so powerful,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:90%
but so would the staffs.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.270 align:middle line:84%
But they operate at
the same frequency.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So that means if there's two
staffs, if I have a staff,

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:84%
the same wavelength
size as yours,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:84%
then we are in radio
communication with each other.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the way an antenna
works is any two oscillators,

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.490 align:middle line:84%
whether they are
crystal oscillators

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:84%
or they're antennas at the
same wavelength, therefore

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:84%
the same height, they are
in instant communication

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now when you say in
communication with each other,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean by that?

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Radio communication.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Because your spine is calcium
and calcium is a metal.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it's a conductor,
your spine is an antenna.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But you're now interfacing
with a more powerful antenna

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:84%
that is actually drawing off
of all of the pyramid power.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Now remember Tesla who is
the father of the Tesla coil.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: And that the
Staff of Moses and Aaron

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:90%
had the serpent, the coil.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:84%
The serpent is really
the symbol of the coil.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.745 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do some people have
higher readings than others?

00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Probably
because of a combination

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
of what you're made of, like
what your body's actually

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
made of, the
chemistry in your body

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and also your state of
spiritual development, right?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is when
Tesla built the Wardenclyffe

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Tower in Long
Island, New York, he

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:84%
was going to transmit power
wirelessly via antenna

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:90%
receivers--

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To the world.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: --to the world.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So if the pyramid was a
crystal oscillator generating

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:84%
frequencies and the Staff
is proportional to the Ark.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And the Ark is
proportional to the Staff,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
then the staff holder
becomes more powerful

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:84%
because their body electric
receives the pyramid power.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's funny in
Christianity that there's

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:84%
no knowledge other than the
earliest Christian art showing

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Jesus with the Bachal
Isu, the Staff.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But most Christians don't equate
Jesus to being a staff holder.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.200 align:middle line:90%
But he is.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus is-- it's interesting
because his antenna height,

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.640 align:middle line:84%
if you take the Shroud of Turin,
we know the height of Jesus.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right
Assuming it's him.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:90%
And it probably is.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.297 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Assuming it's him.

00:13:11.297 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's now been authenticated
to be cloth from the time

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
period of Christ, he's
exactly the same height as me,

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
about 72 inches and
a smidgen higher.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:25.180 align:middle line:84%
The number 72 is also
very, very significant.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is that there were 72
lesser disciples than Christ.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back to the old Old
Testament, the 72 names of God

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient Kabbalah,
in the ancient Hebrew,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:90%
the number 72 is very mystical.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So that means the height
of your body and your spine

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:90%
is your staff.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wrote a
book with my wife

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.380 align:middle line:90%
called "God's Great Pyramid."

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And the mathematics when we
get to the simple measurement

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
of the inch and the
royal cubit inch

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and we perfect
that, what we find

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
is that human language
is like up here.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And we will say the name of God
like the ancient Hebrews would

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:90%
say.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:84%
You can't say it, because
there's no vowels,

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.330 align:middle line:90%
but you would say the Yahweh.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yahweh.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: And then the
First Nations would call it

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.770 align:middle line:84%
See, it has a similar
abruptness and vibration.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But we would say you must have
a different god because we're

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:90%
using a different word.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
But underneath word
is tone in pitch.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And underneath tone in pitch
is a numerical frequency that

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.210 align:middle line:90%
produces the tone in the pitch.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I took measurements
using the true royal cubit

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.918 align:middle line:84%
inch of the Holy of Holies,
the cube in Solomon's temple

00:14:43.918 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:84%
where the Ark of the Covenant
is stored, where the staffs are

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:84%
laying inside, the
number I got using

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
the most repeatable and
reliable 20.605 per royal cubit,

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.460 align:middle line:84%
the Holy of Holies
comes to 34.34 feet.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
look at the tie-in

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.969 align:middle line:84%

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
we know they operated at the
same wavelength and frequency.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:84%
That means they are
in communication

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:90%
with the Great Pyramid.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Could they be drawing
off the pyramid's power?

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.049 align:middle line:84%
Does the staff holder gain
access to all of that power?

would they figure this

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:12.839 align:middle line:90%

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Well the master
architect is obviously God,

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.540 align:middle line:90%
because what we see happen--

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.890 align:middle line:84%
first of all, the Great Pyramid
of Egypt is not Egyptian.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Not a single hieroglyph or
inscription was found inside.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't tell
Zahi Hawass that.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: I know, I know.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And my theory is if you go
to the tone level of language

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and then you go to the
frequency level of language--

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:90%
and frequency is a wavelength--

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.680 align:middle line:84%
the Holy of Holies of
Israel in Solomon's Temple,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:90%
the wave length--

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:50.373 align:middle line:84%
if you take the 20.605 royal
cubit inch which appears in 14

00:17:50.373 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:90%
places in the Great Pyramid.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:90%
It's repeatable and reliable.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Whereas all the other
cubit measurements are not.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:84%
We know in the book
of Ezekiel when

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:84%
the angel appears with
the Staff to Ezekiel

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.390 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the giant wheels
within wheels spacecraft.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had
one, too, didn't they?

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: He says a cubit is
a cubit and a handbreadth.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's elbow to fingertip
plus a handbreadth.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
It is a symbol, because
everybody is different, right?

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.955 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: But that
makes a royal cubit.

00:18:16.955 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:84%
But the Bible doesn't
call it a royal cubit.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So most Hebrew scholars go wrong
and use the old 18-inch cubit.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that now
there is a movement

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
to build the new temple,
Ezekiel's temple,

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to use
the 18-inch cubit, when

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:84%
the angel said, no, it's
a cubit and a handbreadth.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.758 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
what the 15 inch?

00:18:34.758 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Which is
20.605 inches per cubit.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Because in the Great
Pyramid, according to Peter

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Lemesurier's book "The Great
Pyramid Decoded," in 14 places,

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:84%
the 4-1-2-1, 41.21 inches,
is two royal cubits.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And because that's consistent,
consistent, consistent,

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.910 align:middle line:84%
whereas the Egyptian
measuring rods range

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:84%
between 20.6 and 20.8 plus
inches, meaning the Egyptians

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:84%
didn't know it
exactly themselves

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.490 align:middle line:90%
because they didn't invent it.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:84%
The reasons their
rulers varied is

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:84%
they were studying
the Great Pyramids

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:84%
measurements to try to find
out what was a true cubit.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.548 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is the
length so important?

00:19:14.548 --> 00:19:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: The length is so
important because if you get

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.800 align:middle line:84%
the length wrong,
the Holy of Holies,

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:84%
which measures to 412.1 inches,
the most common measurement

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Pyramid is the
4-1-2-1 So there is the Holy

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.730 align:middle line:84%
of Holies at 20 royal cubits
by 20 cubits by 20 cubits,

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:90%
that's 412.1 inches.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
That ties the Holy of Holies
to the Great Pyramid math.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So the reason it has to be exact
is the underlying number always

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:84%
produces two codes, either
the 4-1-2-1 or the 5-1-2-5.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramid slope angle is 51
degrees 51 minutes 25 seconds.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Now the Ark of the
Covenant and the Staff,

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
we know from the Book of
Hebrews 9:4 are the same length.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, they're
the same frequency.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So the length is 2 and 1/2
cubits times 20.605 inches is

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:90%
pyramid number 5-1-5-1.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume you were there
during this time period.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
You have a staff, what
do you do with it?

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: You train with it.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Your nervous system, as you hold
it, as you're herding sheep,

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
you slowly start to
calibrate at the frequency

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.010 align:middle line:84%
that the Staff
antennae represents.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And at that frequency,
once you master it,

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
once your nervous
system masters it,

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.172 align:middle line:84%
you are now going to receive
divine communication.

00:20:36.172 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does
that come to you?

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: It comes to you--

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:84%
when you say
telepathic, we now know,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:90%
because Fritz-Albert Popp--

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For example, when
Moses got the 10 Commandments,

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:90%
did he get it this way?

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Did he have the Staff then?

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:10%
>>SEREDA: He always
had the Staff.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:10%
He had the Staff when he
traveled with his family.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:10%
It says in the
old books of Moses

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.060 align:middle line:10%
that Moses always
traveled with the Staff.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
you get on the donkey

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and you get the family and
you never forget the Staff.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like Jesus
says in Mark 6 you

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:84%
don't forget your staff
because that keeps you

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
in that calibrated
communication state.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So that when Moses then
goes up on to the Sinai,

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
he's using his antenna to
call down God onto the Sinai.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:90%
And then God knows his position.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Now the staff is
emitting the frequency

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:84%
so that we could, then,
in the future, if I could

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:84%
go near the Ark of the Covenant
where it's hidden today

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and I emit the correct
frequency through the Staff,

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that wavelength will fit inside
of the Ark and switch it on.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.538 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And do what?

00:21:47.538 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: I believe
a pillar of light

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.788 align:middle line:84%
would come out of the
sky, because that's

00:21:50.788 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:84%
what the Bible tells us
when the Ark was traveling.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:84%
The pillar of light
came out of the sky.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.113 align:middle line:84%
And it would identify
the Ark's position,

00:21:58.113 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:90%
the missing position--

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Merely because
of the frequency.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Merely because the
frequency would switch it on.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
the same frequency.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We were always
told that if you dabbled

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.180 align:middle line:84%
with the Ark of the
Covenant the wrong way,

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.520 align:middle line:84%
you could get
electrocuted or killed.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.657 align:middle line:90%
They talked about that.

00:22:12.657 --> 00:22:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Well, the
Bible says that you have

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:90%
to be electrically grounded.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
an ankle bracelet.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And that it goes around the
ankle that then would either--

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:90%
the Staff, as soon as--

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.790 align:middle line:84%
see when Moses is
lifting the Staff,

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.362 align:middle line:90%
he's positive transmitting.

00:22:28.362 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
a lightning rod.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Right.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.888 align:middle line:84%
And then when he sticks
it in the ground,

00:22:31.888 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:90%
he's negative receiving.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Now to touch the Ark, you have
to be electrically grounded.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or?

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Or you'll die.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you have the
Staff in your hand

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and you put it in the ground,
you can then touch the Ark.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:90%
That grounds you electrically.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Just like your house, you
have to have a grounding rod,

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.200 align:middle line:84%
otherwise all your appliances
will radiate into your house

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:90%
and may give you cancer.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But the Ark is so
powerful, because I

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
believe it had the 12
staffs inside as the charge.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:90%
It had the tablets--

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.638 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the one
you just showed us.

00:23:02.638 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Like the
one I just showed you.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And then it was so powerful
because of the gold lining.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:84%
The gold is an insulator
so it traps the waves

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:90%
so the wave can't get out.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And that acts as an
electrical capacitor.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.560 align:middle line:84%
The charge won't
leave the Ark until it

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:90%
has a conductor touch it.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And because you're a conductor,
I'm a conductor, if we touch it

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and we're not grounded,
we'll burn to a crisp.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.130 align:middle line:90%
This is really interesting.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
In Graham Phillip's
book on Merlin,

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:84%
he says Merlin
crosses the Atlantic.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.977 align:middle line:84%
Now Stonehenge
sits at 51 degrees.

00:23:36.977 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like the pyramid angle.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.602 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Like a pyramid angle.

00:23:39.602 --> 00:23:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Area 51.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:90%
50 states in the United States.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And the 51st state is
Washington DC hidden.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.520 align:middle line:90%
The 5-1 is the sacred number.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:84%
All the crop circles
in England, 51 degrees.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Weird.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.893 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: They're all north
and south of the line.

00:23:53.893 --> 00:23:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And a degree is
like 67 miles wide.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So you've got that
swath of the degree.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So according to Graham
Phillips, Merlin

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
crosses the Atlantic
on the 51 degree line

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:90%
and stops in Labrador, right?

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Now the legend
is that the Ark traveled

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:84%
with the Knights Templar
and it moved around

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.300 align:middle line:84%
into what was then Gaul,
what we call France today.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: And all
these stations where

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.195 align:middle line:84%
it's stopped, they always
had to keep it moving,

00:24:25.195 --> 00:24:26.820 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
want to get caught.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.210 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want the
Ark and the Staff--

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were hiding it.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: They were hiding it.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And that new theory is that it
crossed the Atlantic, probably

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.190 align:middle line:84%
with Merlin on the
51 degree line,

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.420 align:middle line:90%
and the Staff is 51.51 long.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And they now have
a theory in that it

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:45.870 align:middle line:90%
exists in Newfoundland, Canada.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's an area where
they're digging in there.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And you know the
Shag Harbor UFO case?

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: On the
map, the Shag Harbor

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.690 align:middle line:84%
is so close to where they're
now digging for the Ark

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that I believe the Shag
Harbor UFO case is actually

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.328 align:middle line:84%
a craft that's guarding
the area there.

00:25:04.328 --> 00:25:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think
it's related to that?

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: There could
be a connection there.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Again, you know, this
is a hypothesis, right?

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So why did Merlin
cross the Atlantic?

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.562 align:middle line:90%
Stonehenge is 51 degrees.

00:25:14.562 --> 00:25:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And then he crosses and he
lands in Labrador, Canada,

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.440 align:middle line:90%
at 51 degrees north latitude.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And then that is the theory
where the Ark lays today.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:90%
So

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:84%
If I had the Staff in my
hand and I had it plugged in

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:90%
and I'm transmitting--

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:84%
at a distance, because it's a
radio communication device--

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:90%
the Ark is the same size.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.450 align:middle line:84%
It will receive that
frequency in it.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:37.530 align:middle line:90%
And it will switch it on.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.720 align:middle line:90%
And we'll find the Ark.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:90%
That's my theory.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back
and look at it as it's

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:90%
related to the pyramids again.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And again, it all has
the similarities to it.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the
pyramids, do you

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:56.230 align:middle line:84%
think they were the antenna for
all of these staffs sending out

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.030 align:middle line:90%
frequencies?

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: I think the pyramid
was powered to generate

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:90%
frequencies in a slope tuner.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I've actually measured
all of the frequencies

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid from under
the ground to the ground level

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:90%
to the cap to the top.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
harmonic numbers.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So Tesla would make
a coil as a cylinder.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember,
when I was a kid,

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.710 align:middle line:90%
you get a toilet paper roll.

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:84%
You wrap the copper
wire around it.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:90%
You get a little diode.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:90%
And you get a little rod.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Put the earbud in.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And you slide the
rod up and down--

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Till you
got your frequency.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.775 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Till you got
your radio station up.

00:26:30.775 --> 00:26:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So that the pyramid is a slope
tuner in that the frequency

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:90%
changes every step you go up.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.857 align:middle line:84%
Because the wavelength
gets shorter and shorter.

00:26:40.857 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So the shorter the wavelength,
the higher the frequency.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.880 align:middle line:84%
The longer the wavelength,
the lower the frequency.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:84%
But when I calculated the square
wave frequencies on the base

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid,
I got 4-1-4-1.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which means?

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: It's the
step down from 5-1-5-1.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:90%
And then I got 6-1-6-1, 7-1-7-1.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now tell me what the
basis of the communication

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:90%
was for.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: I believe the
communication basis was

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:12.250 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with God in an
extended bioelectric telepathy,

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
so that God's positioning
in this craft,

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:19.870 align:middle line:84%
in this giant spaceship, would
know where the Israelites were,

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:84%
could communicate to Moses,
turn left, turn right,

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.233 align:middle line:90%
because God is above.

00:27:24.233 --> 00:27:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Don't go that way,
the armies are coming

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:90%
this way, that kind of thing.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Part the sea this way.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.018 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Part the sea.

00:27:29.018 --> 00:27:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Go this way to part the sea.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And the Staff would
emit such a huge charge.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there
are great examples

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I've seen in the military
where they use radio

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:84%
emissions from an
antenna and they

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:84%
can cause waves to do this--
water, salt water to react.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Why salt?

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.790 align:middle line:90%
Salt, it's a crystal.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen these old military
videos of radio waves causing

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:90%
turbulence in the sea.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So if Moses' Staff is
emitting the frequency,

00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:00.640 align:middle line:84%
if God switches on the frequency
from the pyramid to the Staff

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.490 align:middle line:84%
in the same way Tesla's
Wardenclyffe Tower would send

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:84%
electrical power to
an antenna receiver--

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and you can receive
real electrical power--

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.970 align:middle line:84%
then the staff
holder's Staff is then

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:84%
going to transmit into
the sea and we're going

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.250 align:middle line:90%
to get a reaction in the seas--

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they have an
advantage by having that?

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: A huge advantage.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Dendera
lights, what are they?

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: The Dendera
light, again, I

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:28.570 align:middle line:84%
believe is what's called an
electrical inductor, which

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit different
than an antenna.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:84%
An inductor works--
if I have a coil here,

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and this has power
in it, so let's say

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:90%
the Great Pyramid has power.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I have another coil
here that has no power in it.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:84%
The coil with no power gets near
the one that's emitting power.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.530 align:middle line:90%
This will start to have power.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way,
in the Dendera tablet,

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.080 align:middle line:84%
in the carving on the wall
in the temple at Dendera,

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
we see the recipient
sitting underneath it.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's in Egypt.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: It's in Egypt.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see them receiving.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Their hands are
in receiving mode.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe
they're just doing

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:84%
a demonstration of turning
on the giant light bulb.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're
transmitting frequencies

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.430 align:middle line:84%
into the body in
the same way I'm

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:84%
able to use the light
stream wand that I invented,

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.180 align:middle line:84%
which has rubies and has
tourmaline in the core.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.320 align:middle line:84%
When I hold this, I can induct
healing frequencies in the body

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.260 align:middle line:90%
and treat disease.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.832 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's illustrate what
the Dendera lights really are.

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:10%
[BEGIN PLAYBACK]

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:10%
- The most widely cited evidence

electricity is a relief
beneath the temple of Hathor

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:10%
at Dendera, Egypt, that depicts
figures standing around a large

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:10%
light bulb-like object.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.750 align:middle line:84%
The socket is
represented by what

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.750 align:middle line:84%
appears to be a lotus
flower with a stem that

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:84%
runs like a cable along
the bottom of the device.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Inside the bulb is
a snake-like line

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:01.230 align:middle line:84%
winding its way out of
the lotus flower socket.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.740 align:middle line:84%
According to supporters of the
hypothesis that this depicts

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.110 align:middle line:84%
an electrical light, such
as Erich von Daniken,

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:84%
the snake represents the
filament of the bulb.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.344 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Von Daniken created
a working model

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.760 align:middle line:84%
of the bulb in the
laboratory which works,

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.880 align:middle line:84%
emitting an eerie,
purplish light.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.450 align:middle line:84%
He used the same measurements,
including two metal beams

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:34.470 align:middle line:84%
that look like arms stretched
into the big end of the bulb

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and a wire connecting
those beams

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:84%
with the sockets
at the other end.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.890 align:middle line:84%
But where did the
power come from

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to light the bulb
in ancient Egypt?

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.924 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.924 --> 00:30:47.057 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:47.057 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
key question, David.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Where did the power come from?

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Well, you see the
little four [NON-ENGLISH]

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
rings, like I have on the
staff, that's actually a symbol

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.510 align:middle line:90%
for a power transformer.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.270 align:middle line:84%
If you look at power
transformers today,

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.270 align:middle line:84%
you'll see these
ribbed sections.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So that appears
to me that we have

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:84%
a transformer in the
bottom part of where

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.602 align:middle line:90%
we call the Dendera bulb.

00:31:11.602 --> 00:31:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What time period
are we talking about there?

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Oh, you're talking
you know over 5,000 years ago.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
had electricity.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: I believe they
used the electricity

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:28.180 align:middle line:84%
to induct in the coil
of the giant bulb

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.463 align:middle line:84%
to cause the electrons in the
pyramids to become excited.

00:31:32.463 --> 00:31:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And when they
become excited, they

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.480 align:middle line:84%
start to rotate
and emit radiation.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe it
was a light bulb,

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:84%
because you wouldn't-- to
light a room, you could have--

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looked
like a light bulb.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: What's that?

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It looked
like a light bulb.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Well, see
it does initially

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:52.120 align:middle line:84%
except for even the symbol
today for an inductor is a coil.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:90%
A light bulb requires two--

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:84%
an anode and a cathode and
then a coil in between them.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So you have a positive
and negative charge.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.347 align:middle line:84%
And we only see one coil
going through the center.

00:32:02.347 --> 00:32:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what would
they be using it for?

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: To induct
electricity into the pyramids

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.510 align:middle line:84%
to switch them on, so that
they then become giant crystal

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:12.310 align:middle line:90%
oscillators.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And a crystal oscillator that
size, I believe, at the apex

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:22.870 align:middle line:84%
would open up a portal just
above the pyramid for moving

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.380 align:middle line:90%
through different dimensions.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.282 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe--

00:32:25.282 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: So a far greater
purpose than a light bulb.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe it allowed
ETs to come through?

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.165 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Right.

00:32:31.165 --> 00:32:32.710 align:middle line:90%
To have the gods--

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:37.180 align:middle line:84%
see, there are two aspects
of the way a flying saucer

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.950 align:middle line:90%
or anti-gravity craft work.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:42.430 align:middle line:84%
One is actually the
lift of the craft.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And I believe I know this
is the final secret to how

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:50.033 align:middle line:84%
anti-gravity works which is
the actual container traps,

00:32:50.033 --> 00:32:51.450 align:middle line:84%
just like the Ark
of the Covenant,

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:84%
it traps the wave
energy inside of it.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Right?

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I had great conversations with
my former boss Bogdan Maglich,

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.000 align:middle line:84%
who is a nuclear
fusion scientist.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said what did you make the
container of the fusion machine

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:90%
out of?

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.680 align:middle line:90%
And he said steal.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.048 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, that's wrong.

00:33:07.048 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You told
him that was wrong?

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: I told
him it was wrong.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:10.720 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you're right.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.530 align:middle line:84%
He said we should have used
the metal of all metals which

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:90%
is tungsten.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Because tungsten will block
the wave from getting out.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So you lose all of your
power in nuclear fusion

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.640 align:middle line:84%
by emitting through the
wall of the container.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So the secret to levitation
according to my friend Boyd

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Bushman at Lockheed Martin
in the Roswell Incident

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.588 align:middle line:90%
was the container.

00:33:31.588 --> 00:33:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Everybody thinks it's the
coil and the power generator.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.800 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
container, because you

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.060 align:middle line:90%
have to trap the wave.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:42.250 align:middle line:84%
The second part of the UFO
is how it quantum leaps out

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.240 align:middle line:90%
of space.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're like fish
under water right now.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.670 align:middle line:84%
if you have two fish
under the water,

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and they want to move fast,
the faster they wag their tail,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:84%
they push on the
water and the water

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.690 align:middle line:84%
makes them heavier and
heavier and they can't go.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:58.630 align:middle line:90%
We're the same.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.520 align:middle line:84%
When an aircraft
goes through the air,

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.000 align:middle line:84%
it encounters drag,
resistance, against air.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.063 align:middle line:90%
Air is like water.

00:34:05.063 --> 00:34:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I fly enough.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.730 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Right?

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.219 align:middle line:84%
I skydive from 30,000 feet
doing 300 miles an hour.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you hit
the lower atmosphere,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.560 align:middle line:84%
your face masks
start shaking just

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.389 align:middle line:90%
like you jumped into a lake.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:18.880 align:middle line:90%
So space is like that.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.719 align:middle line:84%
We need to get out of space
to move faster than light.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:84%
So space is like
we're underwater.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So the second
aspect of the UFO is

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:30.699 align:middle line:84%
when you trap a wave,
you form what's called

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:32.739 align:middle line:90%
a quantum tunneling event.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And a quantum
tunneling event happens

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:38.390 align:middle line:84%
when you trap a wave in a
material and it can't get out.

00:34:38.390 --> 00:34:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.370 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid has so much
insulation in the Kings

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and Queens chambers here,
you've got granite and limestone

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.139 align:middle line:84%
trapping the wave
into the chamber.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:53.665 align:middle line:84%
So I believe once you had
the Dendera bulb or the Ark

00:34:53.665 --> 00:34:54.790 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant inside it--

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:56.679 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or they called
it a want, too, right?

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:57.479 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Right.

00:34:57.479 --> 00:34:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Or a wand.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.960 align:middle line:84%
The energy would get so
dense in that chamber

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that it would form a
quantum tunneling event.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And it would physically
open up a portal

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and move the person into these
alternate dimensions where

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.280 align:middle line:90%
you can move way, way faster.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From
point A to point B.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Yeah.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And I believe,
actually, at this point

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.370 align:middle line:84%
that all the pyramids
over the planet

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:84%
were like different
radio stations

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.660 align:middle line:84%
to physically move persons,
because we have evidence--

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But did you have
to be in a craft to move?

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: No.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is that
aspect of the craft

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:29.730 align:middle line:90%
is the pyramid itself.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it like
a time machine?

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: The pyramid itself
could move forward and backward

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:84%
in time when these charges
were developed inside

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.350 align:middle line:90%
of the chambers.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And they could also physically
move a person from one pyramid

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:42.880 align:middle line:90%
to another on the planet.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were
looking at the pyramid

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:49.310 align:middle line:84%
in those days and it was
turned on, would it glow?

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Would it illuminate?

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Would you see
something happening?

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: See, that's
a great question.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've asked that
same question to myself.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And there is one
time when people

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.440 align:middle line:84%
witnessed a pyramid the Egypt
being struck by lightning.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And it formed an ionizing
purple aura around it

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.380 align:middle line:90%
that lasted several minutes.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So that gave me the clue
that the way transistors work

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:15.770 align:middle line:84%
on a tiny scale,
as we take quartz

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and we layer it with
conductor materials,

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and then the
transistor when it was

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.980 align:middle line:84%
born in 1947 by Will
Shockley, John Bardeen,

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and Walt Brattain, which is
interesting because that's

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:28.910 align:middle line:90%
the time of Roswell.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:84%
That little tiny chip
called a transistor

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.250 align:middle line:90%
changed the entire world.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David, let's talk
about crystal spaceships.

[BEGIN PLAYBACK]

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.130 align:middle line:10%
- Did the God of
the ancient world

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.610 align:middle line:10%
appear to the prophets in
a huge flying spaceship?

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:53.450 align:middle line:90%


00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Was this giant craft
of God and the angels

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:01.280 align:middle line:84%
used to block out the sun during
the crucifixion of Jesus Christ

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and the miracle of the sun
at Fatima, Portugal, in 1914?

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.680 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of Enoch, the
first biblical prophet,

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Enoch is taken to
heaven in spirit

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and comes before a mighty throne
with the jets of fire rushing

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.440 align:middle line:84%
underneath as if
this throne were

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.170 align:middle line:90%
a spaceship about to take off.

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Was this throne actually
a crystal spaceship

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.810 align:middle line:90%
that took Enoch from Earth?

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:30.630 align:middle line:84%
"I looked and I saw a windstorm
coming out of the north.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:84%
An immense cloud with
flashing lightning

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and surrounded by
brilliant light.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:39.050 align:middle line:84%
The center of the fire
looked like glowing metal."

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Was this metal the
structure of a craft?

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Did the prophets
communicate with God

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:50.290 align:middle line:84%
in these giant crystal
spaceships with their antenna

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:52.660 align:middle line:90%
staff?

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.480 align:middle line:84%
The Gospels make it
clear Jesus was crucified

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.360 align:middle line:84%
during the Jewish
festival Passover, which

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.620 align:middle line:84%
always is celebrated during
a full moon in the spring.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.290 align:middle line:10%
But a new moon is needed
for a solar eclipse

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:07.930 align:middle line:10%
to occur, making
the theory that it

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:11.620 align:middle line:10%
was a solar eclipse
causing the skies to darken

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.900 align:middle line:10%
for three hours.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:18.170 align:middle line:84%
The dark part of an eclipse of
the sun is only a few minutes.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So how do we explain
three hours of darkness?

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Unless we consider the theory
that a giant craft of God

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:31.300 align:middle line:84%
blocked out the sun in
the local region only.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.600 align:middle line:10%
It is a little known that Jesus
used the same Staff as Moses

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.590 align:middle line:10%
in the Bible.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:40.440 align:middle line:10%
Mark 6, Jesus urges
the disciples never

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.680 align:middle line:10%
to forget their staffs.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Exodus 4:20, "And Moses
took his wife and his sons

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.240 align:middle line:90%
and set them upon a donkey.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And he returned to
the land of Egypt.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And Moses took the Staff
of God in his hand."

00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.170 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is the crux
of all of this, isn't it?

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:09.250 align:middle line:84%
How they traveled here,
why they travel here--

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: And how
and why we lost that.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The technology's gone.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: The ancient
technology is gone.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.730 align:middle line:90%
And I hope to bring it back.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it gone because
they took it and left?

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.316 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: It's gone because
we lost touch with it.

00:39:26.316 --> 00:39:29.560 align:middle line:84%
The Holy of Holies that
stored the Ark of the Covenant

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:32.560 align:middle line:84%
that stores the Staff was
destroyed by the Romans

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.880 align:middle line:90%
in around 60 AD.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's the last
time there was a temple.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And a temple in itself
is a frequency tuner,

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.220 align:middle line:84%
because it's cut in
certain dimensions

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.970 align:middle line:84%
to generate a frequency that
rotates inside of the temple.

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:46.990 align:middle line:90%
So we lost all that.

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.760 align:middle line:90%
We don't have a new temple.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that connection.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And we also don't
honor the Staff

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.910 align:middle line:84%
in Christianity and
other religions today.

00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:01.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't use it as an
antenna to extend or own

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.040 align:middle line:90%
psychic abilities to commune.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.840 align:middle line:84%
But we do know
the UFOs are here.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.550 align:middle line:90%
We're seeing them all the time.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:09.730 align:middle line:90%
I saw one as a kid when in 1968.

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.002 align:middle line:84%
And once you see one with
your own eyes, you're--

00:40:12.002 --> 00:40:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, it changes
your whole perspective.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.893 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: It changes you
because no one can tell you

00:40:16.893 --> 00:40:19.060 align:middle line:84%
what you saw and what the
other people in the street

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.980 align:middle line:90%
saw it wasn't happening.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So we know there's
someone superior to us

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.240 align:middle line:90%
observing our Earth.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:30.770 align:middle line:84%
The question is how do you
make real physical contact

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.000 align:middle line:90%
with them?

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've been able to do
that myself building devices

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and calculating frequencies--

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have been
doing that for years now,

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:40.450 align:middle line:90%
haven't you?

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: For years, we took the
NASA radius of five Pleiadian

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.017 align:middle line:90%
suns.

00:40:46.017 --> 00:40:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And with the radius,
you can calculate

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.430 align:middle line:90%
the frequency of the star.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I transmit that
frequency into my body.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.680 align:middle line:90%
And lo and behold, they appear.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I've had them appear
right in front of me.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're like
a human calling card.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: It's like, literally,
a human calling card.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we did it was Sirius,
because NASA knows the radius

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.900 align:middle line:90%
of Sirius A and B perfectly.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you were out in
space, you would look back

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.940 align:middle line:84%
at Alpha Centauri,
Sirius, and our sun

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.222 align:middle line:84%
and we would be a constellation
of three major dots of light.

00:41:14.222 --> 00:41:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know,
when they talked

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:20.840 align:middle line:84%
about these secrets of Fatima
and that so many people

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.390 align:middle line:84%
witnessed what they said
was the sun coming down.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Right.

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now we know
that's not possible.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Not possible.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think they were
looking at what you think

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and that was some
kind of spaceship that

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:37.700 align:middle line:84%
was in front of the sun
giving it that perception

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.680 align:middle line:90%
that the sun was coming down.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And then it went back
up and it was gone.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Right.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But that would disturb
Christians greatly

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.290 align:middle line:84%
to know that God is traveling
in, say, a crystal spaceship.

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:50.063 align:middle line:84%
I say crystal because
the visions of--

00:41:50.063 --> 00:41:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think
they want to hear that.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Yeah.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.285 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to hear
that God is in a spaceship.

00:41:54.285 --> 00:41:57.320 align:middle line:84%
They want God to be
omnipotent and just

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.630 align:middle line:84%
be able to just materialize
and dematerialize.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.270 align:middle line:84%
But when we think
of the crucifixion

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and how it doesn't match
with a solar eclipse--

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.470 align:middle line:84%
they know this now with
astronomy time clocks going

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.800 align:middle line:84%
back-- there is no
eclipse over where

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was crucified to explain
the three hours of darkness.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But if a giant craft
hovered above the site

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and stopped for three hours and
received Jesus' body of light,

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.530 align:middle line:84%
then we would have consistency
with the descriptions of Enoch

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:34.340 align:middle line:84%
the first prophet being taken
into this giant, spherical

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.750 align:middle line:90%
crystal spaceship.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And then going forward
to the prophet Ezekiel

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and the giant wheels
and the burning brass,

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:41.720 align:middle line:90%
he actually saw burning brass.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, something happened.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.778 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about it.

00:42:43.778 --> 00:42:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: So when you go to
Fatima, Portugal, in 1914--

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and Fatima is the name
of Muhammad's daughter--

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: And Muhammad also--

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which means Fay
in Arabic, by the way.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Which means what?

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fay.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:56.420 align:middle line:90%
F-A-Y.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Oh, wow.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My aunt
was called Fatima.

00:43:00.795 --> 00:43:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: We'll see
no one even noticed

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.040 align:middle line:90%
that's not a Christian name.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Muhammad said that the Staff
was equated to the Resurrection.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Muhammad always
walked with his Staff.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So that event is tying
the prophet Muhammad

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.420 align:middle line:90%
to Christianity.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And Muhammad says
in Surah 42:13,

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.250 align:middle line:84%
you cannot make war with
Christians, Jews, and Muslims.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's supposed to be peace
between all these religions.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:26.710 align:middle line:90%
But I believe in Fatima--

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:middle line:84%
you're right-- there's
no way the sun did that

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.220 align:middle line:84%
on the whole planet,
because there's

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.260 align:middle line:90%
no other points of perspective.

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:90%
So it had to be an orb--

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'd burn up.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: --that aligned
and started strobing.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean they
all saw something.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a newspaper
article of that era

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:46.210 align:middle line:84%
of a picture of something
that they're all staring at.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.347 align:middle line:84%
Something dramatic
happened, but I

00:43:48.347 --> 00:43:50.430 align:middle line:84%
don't think it was the sun
physically coming down.

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: You see the
problem with science

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:84%
is it thinks it's the
authority on consciousness.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually
a conscious human

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that invented science to
quantify what it's observing.

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But, David, what if
our entire perception of God

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:12.880 align:middle line:84%
is wrong in that God, we think
of as this omnipotent being

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.230 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there is
one that is that way,

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.210 align:middle line:84%
but that what
we're talking about

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and what people are witnessing
are extraterrestrials and craft

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:29.050 align:middle line:84%
that we consider to be
angels, gods, because we

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:30.280 align:middle line:90%
don't know any better.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.872 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Because we
don't know any better.

00:44:32.872 --> 00:44:35.140 align:middle line:84%
When you see the angel that
appeared to his Ezekiel,

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.240 align:middle line:90%
his staff was six cubits.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.760 align:middle line:90%
So that's like 10.3 feet.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.620 align:middle line:90%
So he would have been a giant.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Just like in the
Dendera light, you

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:45.575 align:middle line:84%
see the giants holding the
tube and the little humans.

00:44:45.575 --> 00:44:46.450 align:middle line:90%
They're not children.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:84%
We know they're not children,
because we can see breasts

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.320 align:middle line:90%
on the women.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So they're not children,
but they're little.

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to see a giant
god like that today, or even

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:57.500 align:middle line:90%
a king--

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.470 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] was
eight feet tall,

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:01.078 align:middle line:90%
bigger than Shaquille O'Neal.

00:45:01.078 --> 00:45:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean if I saw Shaquille
O'Neal and I'm six feet tall,

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm a shrimp.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:04.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: So when you see
somebody who's 8 feet tall,

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.610 align:middle line:90%
they're like gods.

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:10.520 align:middle line:90%
And even when I was--

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Goliath was that way.

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Right.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.050 align:middle line:90%
David and Goliath.

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in India with the
Dalai Lama, he was telling us

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.550 align:middle line:84%
in his seven day teaching that
if a god or goddess appears

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.970 align:middle line:84%
to you, you Buddhists,
in their flying craft,

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:28.420 align:middle line:84%
basically, don't worship
them as the almighty God.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Be friends with them,
but they're not--

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're not God.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: He was warning us.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like don't stay away
from them, be their friend,

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.850 align:middle line:84%
but they don't think because
they're superior to you

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:84%
that you have to fall
down and worship them.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if we think
everything we've done

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.530 align:middle line:84%
was based on God
and it ends up only

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:48.550 align:middle line:84%
being a different layer
of extraterrestrials,

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:51.508 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't negate the
possibility of a God, though.

00:45:51.508 --> 00:45:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: No, it doesn't
negate the possibility of God.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at like how
big your energy field gets--

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:00.340 align:middle line:84%
if you measure the
human aura at 30 feet--

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.150 align:middle line:84%
we have sensitive
SQUID magnetometers.

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:05.380 align:middle line:84%
At Dartmouth College,
they prove the human heart

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.410 align:middle line:90%
has a magnetic aura, a field.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of a
god or even a Buddha

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:15.670 align:middle line:84%
or a superluminal being having
an aura as big as the planet,

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:17.620 align:middle line:84%
when your auras get
bigger and bigger,

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:22.000 align:middle line:84%
you become more powerful in your
ability to manipulate nature.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So a little human with
a small magnetic field

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.730 align:middle line:84%
sees that God changed the
weather, parted the Red

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Sea with his Staff.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:32.380 align:middle line:84%
We say, oh, my god, that must be
the God of the whole universe.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.740 align:middle line:84%
But now when we zoom back and
we see how big the Milky Way

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:39.910 align:middle line:84%
galaxy is with over
100 billion suns,

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and each sun is emitting
more power than any human

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.100 align:middle line:90%
could interface with--

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean we would burn to a crisp
on a tiny fraction of the sun's

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.630 align:middle line:90%
energy--

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:52.210 align:middle line:84%
for the god to be the god
of the whole universe,

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:53.930 align:middle line:90%
nobody could interact with it.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:54.730 align:middle line:90%
It's too powerful.

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where does
this take us, David,

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:00.760 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our
perception of the universe

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and our perception
of what God might be?

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Well, where
it takes us for me--

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've been meditating
every day for 40 years.

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm 57 years old this year.

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And my experience is
that as your aura becomes

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:17.890 align:middle line:84%
more tuned and
more purified, you

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:23.050 align:middle line:84%
start to experience supreme
levels of ecstasy and qualities

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.840 align:middle line:84%
in the nature and in
the landscape around you

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.550 align:middle line:90%
and in people.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So as that quality
expands, you start

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:36.650 align:middle line:84%
to ask yourself the question,
how do I as a human today

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.130 align:middle line:90%
reach out and make contact?

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've been exploring the
ideas of using frequencies

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:46.990 align:middle line:84%
with my body, no plants,
no drugs, just frequencies,

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:49.530 align:middle line:84%
drinking my tea, and
doing my meditation.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:53.955 align:middle line:84%
And for me my religion
is mystic Christianity.

00:47:53.955 --> 00:47:55.330 align:middle line:84%
How do I personally
make contact.

00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're a believer.

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:56.680 align:middle line:90%
You're a believer.

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:58.305 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Oh, I'm a
believer in Christ.

00:47:58.305 --> 00:48:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've had my own
experience with him.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced he's
supremely, blindingly powerful,

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:05.080 align:middle line:90%
which is what I saw.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.115 align:middle line:90%
But how do I know--

00:48:07.115 --> 00:48:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's divine.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: --what the next
levels of the universe are?

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:10.870 align:middle line:90%
How do I make contact?

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.030 align:middle line:84%
The most frustrating
thing about being a human

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:15.230 align:middle line:90%
is it's just us down here.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will prayer
get you there?

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Prayer is in
itself is immensely powerful.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But I found that, ironically,
that there was a reason

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.160 align:middle line:90%
the ancients used the Staff.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.220 align:middle line:84%
It is a tool to make
you more powerful.

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.490 align:middle line:84%
When you raise it, when
you raise an antenna,

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:36.190 align:middle line:84%
you're positive
electricity emitting.

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:39.150 align:middle line:84%
When you stick it in the ground,
when an antenna is grounded,

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:90%
it's receiving.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: So you
have two antennas.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.700 align:middle line:84%
You have a positive emitter
and negative receiver.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You think we'd be
better off today walking around

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.427 align:middle line:84%
with these staffs,
these antenna staffs?

00:48:47.427 --> 00:48:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: I think if people,
if they train with me,

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and people can get
them from me, and they

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:84%
start to work with them, the
experiences I've had with them

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.578 align:middle line:90%
are out of this world, already.

00:48:58.578 --> 00:48:59.620 align:middle line:90%
The personal experiences.

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:01.287 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what's
your website, David?

00:49:01.287 --> 00:49:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: My website
is holyresonance.com.

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is what we
saw on some of those clips.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: What you
saw on the screen.

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:06.850 align:middle line:90%
It's my new website.

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.140 align:middle line:90%
And also davidsereda.net.

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So holyresonance.com
and davidsereda.net.

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you provide
these staffs to people?

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:14.523 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: This is the first one.

00:49:14.523 --> 00:49:16.990 align:middle line:84%
We're ready to give them to
people, sell them to people.

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
will they use it?

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: Well,
they'll get trained.

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SEREDA: See, to
use the frequencies

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.240 align:middle line:84%
of the Holy of Holies,
you do step frequencies.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Just like a pyramid
has steps, you

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:30.450 align:middle line:84%
start with a lower frequency,
higher, higher, higher.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you go higher, you
start to perceive more.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could it be
used as a healing device?

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: I believe so.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.630 align:middle line:90%
We know that frequency heals.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:39.430 align:middle line:90%
And that may be--

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:42.083 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And by the way, I felt
a rush when I was holding it.

00:49:42.083 --> 00:49:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Oh, you did.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Oh, good.

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Well there was a lot of
energy coming through.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you saw the spike.

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Oh, yeah.

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:47.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:48.700 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.690 align:middle line:90%
You've now been tuned.

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I ran through you the 5.151.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to

>>SEREDA: You never know.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Thank you.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I appreciate it.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating work.

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.320 align:middle line:84%
You always bring us
fascinating work.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And in parting,
what would you tell

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:10.515 align:middle line:84%
people who are on the fence
and may not believe all this?

00:50:10.515 --> 00:50:11.890 align:middle line:10%
>>SEREDA: Well,
for me, you know,

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:13.990 align:middle line:10%
when I was baptized
at four weeks old,

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:17.230 align:middle line:10%
and which I remember, I
said to the guy in my mind--

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:19.300 align:middle line:10%
which I couldn't even
articulate with my lips--

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Four weeks old?

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: Yeah.

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:22.000 align:middle line:90%
I remember it perfectly.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I said you don't even
know what you're doing.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.160 align:middle line:90%
You're blind.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.900 align:middle line:84%
You're a believer,
but you don't know.

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:27.608 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You said this
at four weeks old?

00:50:27.608 --> 00:50:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SEREDA: In my mind to him.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And today, I say to
the people sitting

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:34.270 align:middle line:84%
on the fence is don't
sit on the fence.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Jump one way or the other.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.860 align:middle line:84%
You're lukewarm
sitting on the fence.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.120 align:middle line:10%
Try something out.

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:44.270 align:middle line:10%
Try and make contact with
your form of god or goddess.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:45.070 align:middle line:10%
Reach out.

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:47.313 align:middle line:10%
Don't just sit
there on the fence.

00:50:47.313 --> 00:50:48.230 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.150 align:middle line:10%
David, thanks again.

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:50.050 align:middle line:10%
>>SEREDA: Thanks.

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.467 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fascinating,
fascinating.

00:50:51.467 --> 00:50:54.820 align:middle line:10%
You know, I've always watched
old biblical movies of Moses

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:56.720 align:middle line:10%
walking around with his staff.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And I always tried to figure out
why is he holding this thing.

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe it was
like a walking cane.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, we find out it's
much more than that.

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
