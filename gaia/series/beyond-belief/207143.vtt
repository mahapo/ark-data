Bobby grew to hate

those mafioso who appeared

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.630 align:middle line:90%
So what did Bobby do?

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.420 align:middle line:84%
He wrote this book,
"The Enemy Within."

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.520 align:middle line:84%
You can't treat
those kind of people

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:84%
who just helped your brother get
into the White House that way.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Look at it as to why
Bobby Kennedy wasn't

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:84%
killed instead of
why Jack Kennedy was,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.390 align:middle line:90%

reporters to have ever lived.

The integrity of that woman.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And they killed
her because she was

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.023 align:middle line:84%
too close to the truth
about the JFK assassination.

00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:90%
The same thing with Marilyn.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:84%
She should have never
died either, these two

years of each other?

obviously, dying in '68.

Mark Shaw is a former

only a few generations
have been granted

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:10%
the role of defending freedom
in its hour of maximum danger.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:10%
I do not shrink from
this responsibility.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:10%

with any other people
or any other generation.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:10%
The energy, the
faith, the devotion

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:10%
which we bring to this
endeavor will light our country

You see Lyndon Johnson kind of
lurking over there on the side,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.460 align:middle line:90%

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:90%

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, eventually
he was, tragically enough.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.450 align:middle line:10%
>>SHAW: Absolutely.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:10%
But you know, again, in the
new book, "Collateral Damage,"

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:10%
I talk about humanizing
JFK and what we lost,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:10%
and we can talk about
that, as a president,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:10%
but I think it was a point
in history unlike any other.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:10%
We'd had the Depression.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:90%
We'd had World War II, Vietnam.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:90%
We were into all of that.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But the moment that he was
killed, George, in my opinion,

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.067 align:middle line:90%
the world stopped.

>>SHAW: --or something.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree?

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was 13 years old.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I remember my English teacher,
whom I put on the radio

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
show "Coast to Coast"
several years ago--

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Really.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --came in crying.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:90%
We were kids.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.460 align:middle line:90%
We're 13 years old.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what's going on.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And she's crying, and she says,
the president's been killed.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.953 align:middle line:90%
It didn't register with us.

00:03:35.953 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Of course not.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My parents were upset.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I was out playing hockey that
night, you know, on the street

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:90%
with my buddies.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because we were kids.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Years later, it sank in
what really happened to us.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And we lost something
that day which we've never

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.760 align:middle line:90%
been able to replace, have we?

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: I don't
think we have, no.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing
that we haven't.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Through all the turmoil
of the years ahead,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.060 align:middle line:84%
you always go back to that
marker of JFK being killed.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what led
me into looking into the JFK

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:90%
assassination.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I was really never
interested in it.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.562 align:middle line:84%
I was a freshman at
Purdue when he was killed,

00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
but I never really
thought about it

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:84%
through the next few
years and everything.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And then if it's
OK, what triggered

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
the interest was I wrote
a book about Melvin Belli,

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.005 align:middle line:90%
as you know, the--

00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Attorney for Ruby.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: --lawyer for Ruby.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: I practiced law in
his building in the 1980s,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:90%
so I got to know Mr. Belli.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to write
a book about him.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, he represented the
Rolling Stones and Muhammad Ali

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.020 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.395 align:middle line:84%
But then I found
his affiliations

00:04:36.395 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
with the mafia, especially
Mickey Cohen, a Los Angeles

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.840 align:middle line:90%
gangster.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.563 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And I got to thinking
about two or three things.

00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Why in the world was a
civil lawyer like Belli

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:90%
hired to defend Ruby?

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Why did he use that crazy
psychomotor epilepsy insanity

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:90%
defense?

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't he
let Ruby testify?

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led me
into looking into the JFK

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.670 align:middle line:84%
assassination, because
I thought there

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:84%
may be a connection here
between Belli, Cohen,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:90%
the mafia and everything.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.602 align:middle line:84%
And that took me back
to the 1960 election.

00:05:05.602 --> 00:05:07.143 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what
we're going to do

00:05:07.143 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
in this program
tonight, Mark, is

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
go through the scenarios
of John F Kennedy's murder,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Marilyn Monroe's
murder or how she died,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and Dorothy Kilgallen,
the reporter at the time.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And then we will show how
they're all intertwined,

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:90%
aren't they?

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.828 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Exactly.

00:05:24.828 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what I did in the new
book, "Collateral Damage."

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:84%
It's got the longest
subtitle in history.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:10%
And I want to admit that I
kind of-- my investigation kind

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:10%
of ass backwards--

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:10%
I've done that a
lot in my life--

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.010 align:middle line:10%
because I looked at JFK
assassination first,

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:10%
then Dorothy Kilgallen's
death, and then Marilyn's.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.200 align:middle line:10%
You would normally
go Marilyn, 1962.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: '62.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: JFK, '63.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And then Dorothy, '65.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:84%
They died within 40
months of each other.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:90%
All of them died too young.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
But I had already looked
at JFK and Dorothy,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.240 align:middle line:84%
so then I looked into
Marilyn's later on.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, in those days, we
didn't have all the cable news

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:90%
networks.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have 24-hour news.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But what we did have was
quality network newscasts.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Sure did.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.415 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY WATSON: Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.457 align:middle line:84%
You'll excuse the fact
that I'm out of breath,

00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:84%
but about 10 or 15 minutes
ago, a tragic thing,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
from all indications
at this point,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.078 align:middle line:84%
has happened in
the city of Dallas.

00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Let me quote to you this.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And you'll excuse me
if I am out of breath.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:84%
A bulletin-- this is from
the United Press from Dallas.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:84%
President Kennedy and
Governor John Connally

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.987 align:middle line:84%
have been cut down by assassins'
bullets in downtown Dallas.

00:06:32.987 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
They were riding in
an open automobile

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:90%
when the shots were fired.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The president, his
limp body carried

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
in the arms of his
wife, Jacqueline,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:90%
has rushed to Parkland Hospital.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.132 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He, by the way--

00:06:41.132 --> 00:06:44.080 align:middle line:84%
this is a very small story
that I want to pop in here

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:84%
quickly-- was with WFAA
television in Dallas, Texas.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:90%
His name was Jay Watson.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.617 align:middle line:84%
He ended up hiring me in Detroit
as a television producer.

00:06:54.617 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: My goodness.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.320 align:middle line:90%
What a connection.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I did not know
his history until years

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
later that he was one of those
who broke the assassination

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:90%
story out of Dallas.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Did you notice that
they said by assassins?

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Not assassin.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: I'd never seen
that clip before, but see,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:84%
logically speaking,
I mean, you gotta

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
get into this whole
Oswald alone craziness,

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.830 align:middle line:84%
but right away I think
the feeling was it

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:90%
had to be more than one person.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And the proof is right
there, assassins.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's set the
stage for John F Kennedy.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:84%
The guy wins a tremendous
election, but he has help.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:84%
His father gets
the mob involved.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:90%
They need Illinois.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:90%
They need West Virginia.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the mob goes to work.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:90%
And of course, they want favors.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.315 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:07:45.315 --> 00:07:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, we talk about
fixing elections today,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:90%
but boy, this was a dinger.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Joe Kennedy wanted to be
president of the United States,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.447 align:middle line:84%
you know, the patriarch that
I wrote about in my book,

00:07:54.447 --> 00:07:55.405 align:middle line:90%
"The Poison Patriarch."

00:07:55.405 --> 00:07:55.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And he wanted
to be president.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.127 align:middle line:84%
But you know, he was
ambassador to Great Britain.

00:07:59.127 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
That was going to
be a stepping stone.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But he got too close, was too
nice to pacify Adolf Hitler.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So when he came back, that
reputation had been tarnished.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: As a lot of American
businessmen had done.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Exactly.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.735 align:middle line:90%
Including Henry Ford.

00:08:10.735 --> 00:08:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: There were others, too.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Banks and
everything else.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: So he came back
to the United States,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.977 align:middle line:84%
well, if I can't
be president, I'm

00:08:15.977 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
going to make my sons president,
all my power, all my money,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.750 align:middle line:90%
everything else.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:84%
First up was Joe Kennedy Jr,
but he died in World War II.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So now it's Jack
Kennedy for four years--

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bobby.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --Bobby Kennedy
for four years and--

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And Ted.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --Ted
Kennedy four years.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.512 align:middle line:84%
And people think I'm
crazy when I say that,

00:08:30.512 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:90%
but that was Joe's feeling--

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was his thinking.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.799 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --that
that would happen.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was his mentality.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.992 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: First, you've got
to win the '60 election.

00:08:35.992 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And they knew,
like you said, they

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
were going to lose
Illinois and West Virginia.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And so what did Joe,
a smart guy, do?

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:84%
He called his friend,
Frank Sinatra,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:90%
who had ties to the mafia guys--

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.387 align:middle line:84%
Sam Giancana, Frank
Costello, Carlos Marcello--

00:08:50.387 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --we'll talk about all
those guys-- and said, look,

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:90%
we need some help.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And then also, we might be able
to use Mayor Daley in Chicago,

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:90%
who's as corrupt as anybody.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
They ended up winning
those two states,

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
but it was a deal
with the devil,

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
because basically Joe
promised those guys,

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.010 align:middle line:84%
you help us win the
election in '60,

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:84%
we'll leave you alone
when we get in office.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it was such a
narrow victory over Nixon,

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:90%
wasn't it?

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: I think it's
the closest in history.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.985 align:middle line:84%
It was just enough,
just enough votes--

00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: That's right.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --to take it.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So the mob figures
they owe us a favor.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.950 align:middle line:84%
We got this guy
elected president.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All of a sudden,
father Joe says to Jack,

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I want Bobby Kennedy as
your attorney general.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.047 align:middle line:90%
He dictated it.

00:09:36.047 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: He sure did.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And of course,
they did whatever

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.210 align:middle line:90%
father Joe wanted him to do.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Bobby Kennedy becomes
the attorney general.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
out of the box

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
is he decides to go
after the same people who

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:90%
put his brother in office.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And it was
predictable because you

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
know about the McClellan
racketeering hearings

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:84%
when Jack Kennedy
was on the panel

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.883 align:middle line:84%
and Bobby Kennedy
was the lead counsel.

00:09:58.883 --> 00:09:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:10%
>>SHAW: And so Bobby grew
to hate those mafioso who

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.100 align:middle line:10%
appeared and took the Fifth
Amendment, including James

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:10%
Hoffa, who you interviewed.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they put
Bobby down on the stand--

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.965 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Oh, absolutely.

00:10:09.965 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and made him
look like a little runt.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Made fun of him, things
like that and everything.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:90%
So what did Bobby do?

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
He wrote this book,
"The Enemy Within."

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:10%
And in here he says,
basically, about the mafioso--

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:10%
and this is really
what triggered the JFK

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.920 align:middle line:10%
assassination, in my opinion--

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:10%
"they have the look
of Al Capone's men--

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:10%
they are sleek, often bilious
and fat, or lean and cold

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:31.510 align:middle line:10%
in heart.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
They have the smooth
faces and cruel eyes

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:84%
of gangsters that wore the
same rich clothes, the diamond

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:84%
ring, the jeweled
watch, the strongly

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:90%
sweet-smelling perfume."

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't treat
those kind of people,

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:49.005 align:middle line:84%
who just helped your brother get
into the White House, that way.

00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
predictable when he

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:84%
went after them, and
especially this Carlos Marcello

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:90%
that I talked about before.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And so the
wording was we can't just

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.750 align:middle line:84%
go after Bobby because
brother Jack will

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:90%
continue to come after us.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's get the head of
the dog, the president.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Right.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's all these
other theories out there,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and I respect all of
them, but if you really

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
look at logic and motive
with regard to this, Marcelo,

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.960 align:middle line:90%
what did Bobby do?

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:84%
He deported him to the
jungles of Guatemala.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%
And here's this--

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They grabbed him.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, grabbed
him illegally.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then they just
grabbed the guy and took him.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And took him on
a plane to Guatemala,

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:90%
where he almost died.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And dumped him there.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Right.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.158 align:middle line:10%
They get him back in the United
States, somehow or another,

00:11:30.158 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:10%
and then as the end
of 1963 comes along,

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.330 align:middle line:10%
they're going to
deport him again.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And he's in a court
in New Orleans charged

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:90%
with racketeering.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, it just makes a lot
of sense regard to motive.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I can't let Bobby Kennedy
continue to do this to me.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
But you're exactly
right, George.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.960 align:middle line:90%
You're a curious guy.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.457 align:middle line:84%
You can't go ahead
and kill Bobby Kennedy

00:11:49.457 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
because Jack Kennedy will
come after you with everything

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:90%
the government has.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you kill Jack
Kennedy, then Bobby Kennedy

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:90%
will be powerless.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So I always looked at
the JFK assassination

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:90%
differently than anybody.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not the smartest
person in the world,

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.740 align:middle line:84%
but look at it as to
why Bobby Kennedy wasn't

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:84%
killed instead of
why Jack Kennedy was,

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:90%
and that changes everything.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are two people
who have investigated the JFK

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:90%
assassination brilliantly.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:90%
You are one of them.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:90%
The other is the late Mark Lane.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yes.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was on top of
this way before anybody,

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and ought to be commended
for what he did.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Absolutely.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And to take that a
bit further, we're

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
Dorothy Kilgallen.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:10%
He is the only one that she
shared her JFK assassination

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:10%
information with.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:10%
And I regret it
to this day that I

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:10%
was a few days short
of interviewing

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:10%
Mark Lane when he died.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh my God,
wouldn't you have loved

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:90%
to have met Dorothy Kilgallen?

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Oh my God.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.363 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And gotten the
information she got?

00:12:46.363 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:90%
She was a dedicated reporter.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.338 align:middle line:84%
And that's what got
her probably killed.

00:12:50.338 --> 00:12:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, I
never knew about her.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Most people who are
watching will remember her

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:84%
from "What's My Line,"
the television show, where

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.450 align:middle line:90%
she was a star panelist.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:84%
That was watched by 10 million
people every Sunday night--

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, it
was the top show--

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: --on CBS.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --on Sunday.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: She had a syndicated
column in the New York Journal

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:90%
American.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.533 align:middle line:84%
200 newspapers
across the country.

00:13:08.533 --> 00:13:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From Hearst, right?

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, when people
actually read the newspaper.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.920 align:middle line:84%
She had a radio show listened
to by a million people.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.635 align:middle line:84%
There's a photograph of her
at the Dr. Sam Sheppard case,

00:13:18.635 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:84%
standing in the middle
of the courtroom

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle line:84%
with all the other
reporters around her.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And she handled the Charles
Lindbergh baby kidnapping case.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:90%
She was a big deal.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
The New York Post called her
the most powerful female voice

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
This was a college dropout,
who overcame all the gender

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
obstacles and all
of that to rise

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:90%
to the top of her profession.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And when she took on the
JFK assassination, obviously

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:90%
she had the best sources.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And as you know,
George, she ended up

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:90%
at the Jack Ruby trial.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She did, and
was the only reporter

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:90%
to have interviewed Jack Ruby.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Right.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:10%
On the website
thedorothykilgallenstory.org,

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:10%
there is Joe Tonahill, the
co-counsel for Melvin Belli,

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:10%
in a video interview
talking about how

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:10%
that interview
with Ruby happened.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.350 align:middle line:10%
They set it up behind the
railing at the Ruby trial.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:90%
She sat in the front row.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And then she interviewed
Ruby, and Ruby then

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:90%
told her a lot of information.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we
don't know exactly what

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
happened because when Dorothy
died, as we'll talk about,

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:90%
her file was missing.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But that was the
link to Jack Ruby.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:84%
She didn't look at--
what did she do next?

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
She didn't look
at LBJ in Dallas.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
She didn't go to Washington,
look into the military complex.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
She didn't go to Miami to
look into the Cuban situation.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
She went to New
Orleans because she

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:84%
had connected Ruby with
Marcello and, I believe, Oswald.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.388 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, in
the book that I

00:14:39.388 --> 00:14:41.680 align:middle line:84%
wrote, the bestseller "The
Reporter Who Knew Too Much,"

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
she was the reporter
who knew too much.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.130 align:middle line:90%
And she died just months later.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Jim Garrison
was in on finding out

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:90%
what was going on, too.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.980 align:middle line:84%
He knew something was
out of New Orleans.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: He just missed it.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yep.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:90%
He came so close.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: If you watch the JFK
movie, which I'm not a fan of,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:84%
but they have this conference
in Garrison's office,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking
to his subordinates

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.540 align:middle line:84%
about where do we
go, what do we do.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And everybody wants to
go after Clay Shaw, which

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.110 align:middle line:90%
didn't work out.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of them says,
well, wait a minute,

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:84%
we've got to go after Marcello,
he's right here in New Orleans.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And Garrison says, ah, no,
we're going to leave him alone.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, Dorothy dies in 1965.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Correct.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In 1956, one of the
top CBS programs at the time

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
was with the great
newsman Edward R Murrow

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.980 align:middle line:90%
called "Person to Person."

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:84%
He had an opportunity to
talk with Dorothy Kilgallen.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
this, because it'll

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
give us a perspective
of what she was like.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD MURROW:
Dorothy, if you had

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.090 align:middle line:84%
to be confined to
one job of the many

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.038 align:middle line:90%
that you do, which would it be?

00:15:45.038 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOROTHY KILGALLEN: Well,
Ed, I love television.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I have so much fun on "What's
My Line" playing the game,

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and I love our morning
radio program, too.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think that I
would have to settle

00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
for my first love and my true
love, the newspaper business.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:84%
It still has me and
always will, I think.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:90%
I hope.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MURROW: Well, looking
back at this long career

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
of yours in print, all the way
from covering murder stories

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.460 align:middle line:84%
to racing around the
world in aeroplanes, what

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:90%
do you consider your big story?

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KILGALLEN: Well,
it wasn't a scoop

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.010 align:middle line:84%
because everybody was
there, but the story I

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.495 align:middle line:84%
loved most with the coronation
of Queen Elizabeth II.

00:16:23.495 --> 00:16:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And that was her husband
flanked on her right.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: I'm sorry, George, I
get emotional watching that.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
This was a wonderful woman,
one of the finest reporters

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:90%
to have ever lived.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:84%
The integrity of
that woman, and they

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
killed her because she
was too close to the truth

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.373 align:middle line:90%
about the JFK assassination.

00:16:42.373 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:90%
The same thing with Marilyn.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.415 align:middle line:84%
She should have never
died, either, these two

00:16:45.415 --> 00:16:46.690 align:middle line:90%
remarkable women.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, but that just--

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:90%
it never should have happened.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think she knew, Mark?

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:90%
What do you think she knew?

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: I think that she really,
through her diligent reporting

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:90%
and going to New Orleans--

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.120 align:middle line:84%
you know, we can
talk about that trip.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.970 align:middle line:84%
She took her hairdresser
with her, Mark Sinclair.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:84%
He was going to
do her hair there.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And they got there, and
he went to the hotel.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.119 align:middle line:84%
And she went out, and
she met who she later

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:84%
said was the best source that
she could find about the JFK

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.269 align:middle line:90%
assassination.

00:17:14.269 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Then she calls the
hotel and tells him,

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:84%
you go back to New York City,
and you don't tell anybody

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:90%
that I was there.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.964 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: And you were there.

00:17:23.964 --> 00:17:25.280 align:middle line:90%
And so he goes back there.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And then after
she gets back, she

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
says to him, if the
wrong people knew

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:84%
what I know about the
JFK assassination,

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:90%
it would cost me my life.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I've bought a gun, and
I'm afraid for my family.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.915 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: She was too
close to the truth.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I think the book that she was
writing for Random House would

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
have nailed Carlos Marcello
as orchestrating the JFK

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.390 align:middle line:84%
assassination, and it would
have shown that J Edgar Hoover

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.160 align:middle line:90%
covered up the assassination.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, that just couldn't happen.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And they set her
up for the kill,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, poisoned her
body with barbiturates,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
which I show how that happened
in "Collateral Damage."

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Then they cover it up.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
There's no investigation
of any kind.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, she
disappears for 50 years,

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.930 align:middle line:84%
until I find out about her while
I'm investigating Melvin Belli.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I look into her
life and times and her death,

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.013 align:middle line:90%
and in some ways--

00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to brag a little--

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.638 align:middle line:84%
I kind of brought
her back to life,

00:18:18.638 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
where people found out about
who this remarkable woman was.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in the afterlife?

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
there's a connection there?

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Oh, yes.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think what has to
happen to those people that

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:90%
don't, they have to be open.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:90%
You have to be open to this.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't there?

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And Dorothy Kilgallen
is a perfect example.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:90%
I just got a chill saying this.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you right
now, she was my patron saint.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:90%
She was my guiding light.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.680 align:middle line:84%
The moment that I started
to look into the JFK

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:84%
assassination, she
took me on paths

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:84%
that I would have never
gone after otherwise.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It was just like she had
chosen me to write her story.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:90%
I felt that.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
I have a photograph of her
right up near my writing table.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:84%
When I look at her, I feel
like she's kind of there.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.183 align:middle line:90%
She's talking to me.

00:19:05.183 --> 00:19:06.725 align:middle line:84%
But I've had that
happen with other--

00:19:06.725 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.685 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --books
of mine, as well.

00:19:08.685 --> 00:19:11.247 align:middle line:84%
All of my titles for my
books, almost 30 of them now,

00:19:11.247 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
come to me in the
middle of the night.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not
just a coincidence.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, "The
Poison Patriarch,"

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:84%
"Down for the Count"
about the Mike Tyson

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
trial, "Miscarriage of Justice"
about the spy Jonathan Pollard.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: "The Reporter
Who Knew Too Much."

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.428 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: "The Reporter
Who Knew Too Much."

00:19:25.428 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:90%
That's not a happenstance.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the first person to
tell you that I welcome that.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And many times, too, I'll tell
you, I got stuck in my books

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.200 align:middle line:90%
about the JFK assassination.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Then I'd go to bed, wake up
in the middle of the night,

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:90%
and somehow--

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And have the answer.

00:19:39.575 --> 00:19:40.992 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --or
another, here it was.

00:19:40.992 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So she was
a bulldog, too, Mark.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:84%
She just went after
every lead she could.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.880 align:middle line:84%
What was it that
made her convinced

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:84%
that there was a conspiracy
involved with the JFK

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:90%
assassination?

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, I don't like
to use that word too much,

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:84%
but I think plot to
kill the president,

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:84%
she led me right to the
Jack Ruby trial transcripts.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.667 align:middle line:84%
And amazing, nobody
ever knew about them.

00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:05.750 align:middle line:90%
You know, they were there.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:90%
I missed it all.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:90%
All this was in plain sight.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Dorothy wrote columns, "the
Oswald file must not close".

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.250 align:middle line:90%
Ruby is a star at last.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:90%
She's in the front row.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.330 align:middle line:84%
She's going the
opposite direction

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:84%
from J Edgar Hoover's
Oswald alone,

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Oswald alone,
Oswald alone theory.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But the Jack Ruby trial
transcripts, when I found them,

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:90%
I just screamed.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.232 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did you find them?

00:20:27.232 --> 00:20:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, there was a lawyer
down in Fresno, California who

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:84%
picked up "The Reporter Who
Knew Too Much" at five o'clock

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.250 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon, told me he
read it by midnight, and said,

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I have a gift for you, I found
the Ruby trial transcripts.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, duh, Mark,
why didn't you find them?

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:90%
He sent them to me.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
2,000 pages, and I looked
at every single one.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was shocking to me
the kind of things I found,

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:84%
just like this
excerpt right here.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Just look at this.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.023 align:middle line:90%
This is an eyewitness account.

00:20:53.023 --> 00:20:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And these are the most
credible documents in history

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:84%
because all of these people
were there when the JFK

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:90%
assassination took place.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a parking lot
owner across from Jack Ruby's

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:90%
Carousel Lounge.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Ruby comes over the day that
he's going to shoot Oswald.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
He's on the
telephone, and he says

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:84%
the conversation,
I understand it,

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.280 align:middle line:84%
was about the immediate
transfer of Oswald

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:84%
from the city to
the county jail.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.435 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Ruby informed whoever
he was talking to the people

00:21:21.435 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:84%
to cut flowers and
things and so on.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.490 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.550 align:middle line:90%
The transfer was delayed.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, did Ruby say anything in
reference to whether or not,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:84%
concerning whether or not
he would be there or not?

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:90%
What did he say on that?

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:84%
He told whoever it
was he was talking

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:90%
to that he would be there.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:90%
He would be there, yes.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And then I found--

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:84%
so obviously, he
just didn't happen

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.510 align:middle line:84%
to be by the basement at the
Dallas Police Department.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:90%
He'd planned on being there.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:90%
He was stalking Oswald.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Then he says, I was going
to make like a reporter,

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:84%
in these documents, to
get into the basement--

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But all
the cops knew him.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --and I'm going to
use my pals at the police

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:90%
department to help me get there.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They all got him in
because they all knew the guy.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:90%
They knew he wasn't a reporter.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Oh, yeah.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.177 align:middle line:84%
Dorothy wrote a
column about that,

00:22:03.177 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:84%
because when it came out
about the Carousel and Ruby,

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the acts that she knew
about in New York City said,

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:84%
well, I played the Carousel,
you know, Ruby's bar,

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:90%
and it was filled with police.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:90%
He let them all in there free.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's
assume the mob has

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:84%
told Ruby you have
got to kill Oswald,

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.340 align:middle line:84%
because even though he
may have been a patsy,

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:90%
he knows what the plan was.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:90%
He was part of this somehow.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get him
and take him out.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did Jack
Ruby know that this

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%
was a one-way trip for
him, that he wasn't

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:90%
going to get out of this?

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: No, they--

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they had a death
penalty in Texas, didn't they?

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --promised
him-- you know,

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:84%
what I've been able to
show in "The Reporter Who

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.308 align:middle line:84%
Knew Too Much," then
"Denial of Justice,"

00:22:46.308 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:84%
now "Collateral Damage,"
where I connect everything,

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.967 align:middle line:84%
is that Melvin Belli
was involved first.

00:22:50.967 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The lawyer.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: He knew about it.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.067 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
know is because I

00:22:54.067 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:84%
had an eyewitness
that I examined

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:84%
for "Melvin Belli,
King of the Courtroom,"

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:84%
who told me they were having
dinner at Fisherman's Wharf

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.560 align:middle line:84%
when a waiter came
up and said, you'll

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
never guess what happened,
Ruby shot Oswald.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Belli said, well, now I
have to represent Ruby.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:90%
So I think Ruby was on call.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And so he would have
represented Oswald if he lived.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And they shut up Oswald.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, Ruby is alive.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:90%
They've got to shut up--

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've
got to shut him up.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: --Ruby.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So he uses that
defense of insanity.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.930 align:middle line:84%
He uses it to-- won't
let him testify.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And you know, during the
final argument for Jack--

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wanted
to lose that case.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it was obvious
that he killed him.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Absolutely.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We saw it on
network television.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:10%
>>SHAW: And in the final
argument, not once, as you'll

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:10%
see in the Ruby
trial transcripts,

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:10%
did Ruby ask or plea for Ruby
to stay alive, to not be killed,

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.962 align:middle line:10%
to not be, you know,
a death penalty there.

00:23:48.962 --> 00:23:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Death penalty.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And so I think it
all made sense through there.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
Dorothy figured out,

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:84%
that it was a plot to
kill the president all

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.947 align:middle line:90%
the way through there.

00:23:58.947 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:90%
So she figures this all out.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.030 align:middle line:90%
All of a sudden, what happens?

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Who decides to bump her?

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Because she's going to write
a book with Random House

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.650 align:middle line:84%
that her friend Bennett Cerf,
who was on "What's My Line,"

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:90%
was the publisher of--

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Right.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and she was going
to do a tell-all, wasn't she?

00:24:17.337 --> 00:24:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, back
in those days,

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have Kinko's,
so she couldn't

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.602 align:middle line:84%
make a copy of this
investigative file.

00:24:22.602 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:84%
In the "Collateral Damage"
book and the others,

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I have a picture of her in
the courtroom with this file

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:90%
against her chest.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.990 align:middle line:90%
She's in Daley Plaza.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she was there.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:84%
With all due respect to
all of these other authors

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and so-called experts
and everything

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.470 align:middle line:84%
that have written about
the assassination,

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:84%
including me before I got
involved with Dorothy,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.850 align:middle line:90%
they weren't there.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Dorothy was there.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:90%
That's why she's so credible.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:90%
So she's got this file.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:90%
She's carrying it around.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.450 align:middle line:90%
She's working on the book.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.160 align:middle line:84%
She shows it to
Bennett Cerf the night

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.840 align:middle line:90%
before she is killed and died.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk about
how that happened.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And so now she's got
all this, and she's

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:84%
going to take it into the media
with the book and all of that.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And people have said
to me, well, she knew

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.030 align:middle line:90%
she was in danger, didn't she?

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't she do
something about it?

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, she felt like she was
at the top of the world.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:09.530 align:middle line:90%
She--

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Untouchable?

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.993 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Untouchable.

00:25:10.993 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:90%
And so nobody could do that.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
They did try to
scare her, though.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
About two weeks
before she died, there

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:84%
was a photograph of her son
Carey, who she dearly loved,

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:84%
on the front page of one
of the New York newspapers

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:90%
running across Central Park.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And so she knew that
somebody had followed him-

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: --in there.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:29.670 align:middle line:90%
And I think that was--

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Watching the family.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.697 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: --the warning.

00:25:30.697 --> 00:25:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Dorothy, back off--

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Back off.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --or we're
going to go forward.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:90%
But she didn't back off.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The CIA kept a
file on Dorothy, as well.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:90%
What was their interest, Mark?

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.098 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: The CIA document
that I only found recently

00:25:42.098 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'll have in
"Collateral Damage,"

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and what it showed me was that
they had been trailing her

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:90%
for years.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.648 align:middle line:84%
I found-- there's one document
with her signature on it.

00:25:50.648 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did
they want with her?

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: I think they thought she
was a threat to them, you know?

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.125 align:middle line:84%
Because she was so big,
so powerful, you know?

00:25:57.125 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And knew too much.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.958 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And knew too
much and everything.

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the one has her
signature on a document

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:90%
about Cuban exiles.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:84%
There's one file, or
one column that she

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.975 align:middle line:84%
wrote about Frank Sinatra's
love affair with Marilyn Monroe.

00:26:11.975 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, and Frank
hated her, by the way.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: And hated her.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hated her.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.725 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yes, exactly.

00:26:15.725 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And so there's these
documents in here,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:84%
but they show that
they were trailing her,

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:84%
the CIA, and the FBI,
as well, in their files.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So they thought of Dorothy
Kilgallen as a real threat

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.970 align:middle line:84%
even before the JFK
assassination took place.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's so
bizarre about all of this,

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Mark, is through all the
incredible things that

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:84%
were going on in this time
period, the Cuban Missile

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Crisis and all
these other things,

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy still had
time to frolic around

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and to play around
with all this.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.530 align:middle line:90%
And Dorothy knew all this.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
She was friends
with Marilyn Monroe.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into her
situation in a second.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But she knew something, and
was going to release it,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
because she kept telling people,
if people knew, as you just

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.988 align:middle line:90%
said, what I know, I'd be dead.

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: She was a blabbermouth.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did she
decide to go public?

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.642 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, I think she
really believed-- you know,

00:27:09.642 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:90%
she was a woman of the truth.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Like I've said to you,
you're a man of the truth.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.258 align:middle line:90%
She was a woman of the truth.

00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, she actually went
out there and found the facts

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:84%
for a story, and then came
up with the conclusion

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:90%
or the headline.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.090 align:middle line:90%
We do that backwards today.

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:84%
They want the
sensational headline,

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll fit the facts
to it or whatever that way.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:90%
And so she wasn't like that.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.720 align:middle line:84%
How many people around the
world have emailed me and looked

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
at all of my presentations
and everything on YouTube

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and listened to your show
have said to me, God,

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I wish we had a reporter
with the integrity of Dorothy

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Kilgallen, or those
nightly newsmen

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.478 align:middle line:90%
like Walter Cronkite or the--

00:27:44.478 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Edward R Murrow.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Edward R Murrow,
those kind of people.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't have those kind
of people anymore, George.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, we don't.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.070 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Without giving us
specific names,

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:84%
give me the scenario of how
you think Dorothy was killed.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, basically
they set her up.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:84%
They knew that she was
going to write this book,

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:90%
and so she couldn't do that.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So what I believe happened
is the night before she died,

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:84%
she met a mystery man, who
will be named in "Collateral

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:12.325 align:middle line:90%
Damage," and they were at the--

00:28:12.325 --> 00:28:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who's still alive.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Who's still alive.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to get him
prosecuted by the New York

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Police Department, unfortunately
unsuccessfully yet.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to keep after it.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.230 align:middle line:90%
They are at this hotel bar.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:24.070 align:middle line:90%
They're seen.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.630 align:middle line:90%
They're in the corner.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.040 align:middle line:84%
They're whispering
to each other.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that particular
person was Dorothy Kilgallen's

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.010 align:middle line:90%
friend, even a lover perhaps.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:36.250 align:middle line:84%
She had shared her information
about the JFK assassination

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.870 align:middle line:84%
with him because
it was a reporter,

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and she believed he had
leaked it to the wrong people,

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.980 align:middle line:90%
as she put it.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:90%
The wrong people.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:90%
So he then is there.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:84%
We believe that he either
did one of two things.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.305 align:middle line:84%
He emptied barbiturates into
her drink that she had there--

00:28:51.305 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He laced it.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.555 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And I
found out because I

00:28:53.555 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:84%
looked at the autopsy
for the first time, which

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is in the book
"Collateral Damage," there

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.390 align:middle line:84%
wasn't one barbiturate
in there, but three.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Or, he goes home with her and
she lets him in for a nightcap,

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and then he poisoned her drink
with phenobarbital, Tuinal,

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:90%
and Seconal.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where was
husband, Richard?

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.517 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, they
were estranged.

00:29:13.517 --> 00:29:15.550 align:middle line:84%
He was about two floors
up in her mansion

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:16.745 align:middle line:90%
on East 68th Street.

00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this had
many floors to it.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Absolutely.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can
literally hide, and nobody

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.678 align:middle line:90%
would know you were in there.

00:29:21.678 --> 00:29:25.155 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: But I did find
the butler's housekeeper--

00:29:25.155 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sorry,
butler's daughter,

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.200 align:middle line:84%
who told me that her
father heard somebody

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.400 align:middle line:90%
with Dorothy that night.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.655 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of confirmed
a bit of the idea

00:29:32.655 --> 00:29:34.030 align:middle line:84%
that there was
somebody with her.

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think she was
killed at home.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
She was left, then, in a
very mysterious situation,

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.600 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:84%
She had her hairpiece on,
her eyelashes, her makeup on,

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
found in a bedroom
she never slept in.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, basically,
what I believed

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.780 align:middle line:84%
is that between when the
intruder, the person who

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.780 align:middle line:84%
set her up and did the
barbiturates, when he left,

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:84%
after that, she crawled
probably into the bathroom

00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.965 align:middle line:90%
and died right there.

00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, and
died right there.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And was found the next
morning by her hairdresser.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Those drugs, at
the time, were very lethal.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Absolutely.

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you took too much.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.777 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: The combination
would have been.

00:30:07.777 --> 00:30:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what happened to
her notes and her book and all

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:11.630 align:middle line:90%
that information?

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.492 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Well, they disappeared.

00:30:13.492 --> 00:30:14.340 align:middle line:90%
And the--

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How convenient.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah, very convenient.

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And the butler's daughter
told me-- and I'm

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.880 align:middle line:84%
trying to be able
to confirm all this,

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and I think I have-- that the
next morning after Dorothy

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.840 align:middle line:84%
died, FBI agents
or people who said

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:84%
they were FBI agents
stormed the townhouse

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and took all of her papers,
documents, and everything else

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.040 align:middle line:90%
And I think they took that file.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to get it through
Freedom of Information requests

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:84%
from the New York Police
Department and the FBI,

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.300 align:middle line:90%
so far unsuccessfully.

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.280 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
government not giving us

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:84%
the JFK assassination documents,
because I kind of believe

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:84%
that those documents,
Dorothy's documents

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.750 align:middle line:84%
might be in those
papers, as well.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:53.625 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Now let's move on
to Marilyn Monroe.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Mark, she was a
superstar of her day.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
She came up from nothing, but
she made herself a success.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.090 align:middle line:90%
She was a good actress.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:05.740 align:middle line:90%
She knew how to sing.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And she somehow caught the
eye of our president, John F

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:14.075 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy, because of an
introduction by Frank Sinatra.

00:31:14.075 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Frank Sinatra, yeah.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.583 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank you, Frank.

00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: The journey to
Marilyn is very strange.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.780 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I wasn't
going to write this book.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.890 align:middle line:84%
But the very first thing that
triggered all of this when I

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:28.190 align:middle line:84%
decided to-- was Marilyn a
friend of Dorothy Kilgallen's?

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, I didn't know.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I think I had written before
that maybe Marilyn had gone

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.590 align:middle line:84%
to parties at
Dorothy Kilgallen's.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
ran into each other.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:35.818 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: And things like that.

00:31:35.818 --> 00:31:38.240 align:middle line:84%
But then I found this photo
that I think we can look at.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was a photograph of
Marilyn Monroe and Dorothy

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Kilgallen together.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.790 align:middle line:84%
They were on the set of a
movie, "Let's Make Love"

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.426 align:middle line:90%
with Yves Montand in 1960--

00:31:46.426 --> 00:31:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who?

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Montand.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who?

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Yeah.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.750 align:middle line:84%
You remember him,
the French actor?

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
remember him at all.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Well--

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the picture.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.643 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --here's a
photograph of them.

00:31:54.643 --> 00:31:56.420 align:middle line:90%
And they're at 20th Century Fox.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And so, OK, wait a minute they
know each other, all right?

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, I'd always been
a little suspicious of Marilyn

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Monroe supposedly
committing suicide,

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.490 align:middle line:84%
or what they called
probable suicide.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.930 align:middle line:90%
And so I wondered about that.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that was the
so-called official report.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Exactly it was.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.400 align:middle line:90%
But I wondered about that.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, well,
did Dorothy Kilgallen

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:20.450 align:middle line:84%
write any columns about
Marilyn Monroe before she died?

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I should look into that.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
column that came up.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we look
at it, you'll see

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that it was the real
curious point to me

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
wrong with the fact

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.200 align:middle line:84%
that Marilyn would
have been in the mood

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.300 align:middle line:90%
to have committed suicide.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.270 align:middle line:90%
MM has Hollywood talking again.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Marilyn Monroe's health
has been improving.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:10%
She's been attending
select Hollywood parties,

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.050 align:middle line:10%
has become the talk
of the town again.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:10%
In California, they're
circulating a photograph that

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.110 align:middle line:10%
certainly isn't as bare
as the famous calendar,

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.560 align:middle line:10%
but is very interesting, and
she's cooking in the sex appeal

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.850 align:middle line:10%
department, too.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:33:00.050 align:middle line:10%
She's proved vastly alluring
to a handsome gentleman who

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:10%
is a bigger name than Joe
DiMaggio in his heyday.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.870 align:middle line:10%
So don't write off
Marilyn as finished.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And that person, of
course, was John F Kennedy.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And when she sang for
him at his birthday,

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:16.220 align:middle line:90%
the people were just aghast.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.620 align:middle line:10%
>>PETE HAMMOND: Her most
famous film appearance

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:10%
could well be when she sang
happy birthday to John F

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:10%
Kennedy.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And that piece of
film is truly iconic.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:33.384 align:middle line:10%
>>PETER LAWFORD: Mr. President,
the late Marilyn Monroe.

00:33:33.384 --> 00:33:36.772 align:middle line:10%
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:33:36.772 --> 00:33:41.612 align:middle line:90%


00:33:41.612 --> 00:33:45.848 align:middle line:84%
>>MARILYN MONROE:
(SINGING) Happy birthday--

00:33:45.848 --> 00:33:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HAMMOND: To look
at her that night,

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:50.030 align:middle line:84%
you would think there's
absolutely nothing wrong.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:54.260 align:middle line:84%
You look at this woman who seems
at the height of her powers

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.230 align:middle line:90%
during that.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.960 align:middle line:10%
And now that we
know in retrospect

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:10%
that there was much more
to this relationship

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.120 align:middle line:10%
with the president,
it's quite interesting.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.367 align:middle line:84%
>>MONROE: Everybody,
happy birthday.

00:34:05.367 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HAMMOND: They had
to keep announcing

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:84%
her, here's Marilyn Monroe,
here's Marilyn Monroe,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and they finally announce
here's the late Marilyn Monroe.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.679 align:middle line:84%
Six months later, she was
the late Marilyn Monroe

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.405 align:middle line:84%
because her death
happened in August.

00:34:18.405 --> 00:34:20.030 align:middle line:10%
>>THEODORE CURPHEY:
It is my conclusion

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:21.800 align:middle line:10%
that the death of
Marilyn Monroe was

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:10%
caused by a self-administered
overdose of sedative drugs,

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:29.630 align:middle line:10%
and that the mode of
death is probable suicide.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what the world
did not know at the time, Mark,

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.469 align:middle line:84%
that she was always frolicking
with Bobby Kennedy, as well,

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:37.940 align:middle line:90%
the president's brother.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Well, when I read
Dorothy's column about Marilyn,

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.427 align:middle line:84%
a bigger name than Joe DiMaggio,
who you know is the Yankee Hall

00:34:44.427 --> 00:34:45.469 align:middle line:90%
of Famer and everything--

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:45.784 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Yankee clipper.

00:34:45.784 --> 00:34:46.951 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: --and I thought, OK.

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:48.469 align:middle line:84%
Now, I did go to
those autopsies,

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:51.159 align:middle line:84%
and found differences with
the autopsy and certificate

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.159 align:middle line:90%
of death and everything.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I think I may have
mentioned also,

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and I have it in
"Collateral Damage," when

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cyril Wecht, who you
know, the forensic scientist--

00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know Cyril.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: --said to me that--

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:01.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great pathologist.

00:35:01.535 --> 00:35:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --when he looked
at Marilyn's autopsy,

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I've conducted 16,000
autopsies, I've

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.880 align:middle line:84%
never seen a verdict
of probable suicide.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: She probably died of
suicide, that's the verdict.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, OK, now,
if she didn't commit

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.780 align:middle line:90%
suicide, who are the suspects?

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, John Kennedy, OK?

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But what I found out
is that Papa Joe,

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.880 align:middle line:84%
who always ran things, Joe
Kennedy said to John Kennedy,

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.680 align:middle line:90%
dump that.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.500 align:middle line:90%
That's done.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going to run
for president in '64.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's going to kill--

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: I don't want to see you.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --your reelection.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.062 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: So then I thought, well,
who's the next biggest name?

00:35:34.062 --> 00:35:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Bobby Kennedy.

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And that led me on a trail
right to Bobby Kennedy,

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.920 align:middle line:84%
because I found
out that this book

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.307 align:middle line:84%
that he had written
about the mafioso

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:90%
that I talk about before--

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.557 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "The Enemy Within."

00:35:45.557 --> 00:35:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --the
summer of '62, he's

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:84%
in LA trying to get a movie
made over at 20th Century Fox.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I found ledgers where he is
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:55.550 align:middle line:90%
So he's there the whole summer.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I found these
two damning documents.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:84%
One was a letter from
Jean Kennedy Smith, JFK

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.312 align:middle line:90%
and RFK's sister.

00:36:04.312 --> 00:36:05.270 align:middle line:90%
It was sent to Marilyn.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.880 align:middle line:84%
We understand you and Bobby are
the new item, exclamation mark.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.097 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: When he comes back to
New York, when he comes back

00:36:12.097 --> 00:36:14.480 align:middle line:84%
to the East Coast,
please come with him.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I found a CIA document that was
exposed the day before Marilyn

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:22.580 align:middle line:84%
died that said Bobby Kennedy
has been having a torrid love

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.320 align:middle line:90%
affair with Marilyn Monroe.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he has told Marilyn
that he will divorce Ethel

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.920 align:middle line:90%
and marry Marilyn.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelievable.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: So you can imagine
this Marilyn Monroe.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Dorothy wrote a column
about her craving love,

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and her three divorces
and all of that.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.670 align:middle line:90%
First, it's JFK.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And she obviously
had sex with him,

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and he must have told
her he cared about her.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:90%
He dumps her.

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He felt like
she was passed along.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Right.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:48.817 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And then she's
by the telephone,

00:36:48.817 --> 00:36:52.730 align:middle line:84%
she can't get Bobby Kennedy to
go ahead and answer her calls.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:57.020 align:middle line:84%
She ends up at an event up in
Lake Tahoe, at a lodge up there

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.030 align:middle line:90%
the week before she dies.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.655 align:middle line:84%
Frank Sinatra is there,
Peter Lawford is there,

00:37:01.655 --> 00:37:02.780 align:middle line:90%
all these people are there.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.738 align:middle line:84%
She feels like she's
going to be passed around.

00:37:04.738 --> 00:37:05.570 align:middle line:90%
She's had it.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:08.792 align:middle line:84%
And she made the same mistake
that Dorothy Kilgallen made.

00:37:08.792 --> 00:37:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the similarities

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.810 align:middle line:90%
in "Collateral Damage."

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:13.280 align:middle line:90%
She was a blabbermouth.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to the
media, I'm going

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:17.270 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
Kennedys, and all of that,

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
just like Dorothy
talked about her book.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And what she said is
in a CIA document.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is the one
that caused her death,

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.120 align:middle line:84%
no question about it,
because what did she say?

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.050 align:middle line:84%
They talked about UFOs, the
similarities between Marilyn,

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.312 align:middle line:90%
Dorothy, and JFK's obsession--

00:37:34.312 --> 00:37:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They loved it.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.735 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: --with UFOs.

00:37:35.735 --> 00:37:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They loved it.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:36.260 align:middle line:90%
They were obsessed with it.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.343 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And we should talk
about that in a minute.

00:37:38.343 --> 00:37:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But more, it said the
subject, Marilyn Monroe,

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:84%
is going to the media about
the Kennedy love affairs.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.740 align:middle line:90%
And this was the kicker, though.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And also, she is going to
the media about matters

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:57.260 align:middle line:84%
involving JFK and his plans to
have Fidel Castro assassinated.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Those are matters of
national security, either

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
through pillow talk or
the Kennedy boys trying

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.680 align:middle line:90%
to impress her or whatever.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine,
there's no way

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.860 align:middle line:84%
they can let her go to the media
with that kind of information.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.980 align:middle line:84%
On Gaia's program "Open
Minds," Regina Meredith

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.950 align:middle line:84%
interviewed a psychic crime
fighter named Robbie Thomas.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:17.720 align:middle line:84%
That has a little
bit to do with this.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.123 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:38:19.123 --> 00:38:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
You have beings

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.690 align:middle line:84%
that you're working with that
are assisting you and showing

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.440 align:middle line:84%
you what you need
in your higher self.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.398 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBBIE THOMAS: Right.

00:38:26.398 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: But sometimes
the actual victim

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.240 align:middle line:90%
comes to you, too.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>THOMAS: Yeah.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know how their spirit,
our spirit is multidimensional.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.070 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say and think
this, this stays within.

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But our spirit is
more than that, right?

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Many realms.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:49.040 align:middle line:90%
And we encounter all of it.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Cesar Ivan Cano, a young
boy, all I was given

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.600 align:middle line:90%
was a photograph.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in Canada,
and he's murdered

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:58.330 align:middle line:90%
in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.730 align:middle line:84%
He's missing, can
you please help.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:90%
So they sent me a picture.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.920 align:middle line:90%
All I got was his name, Cesar.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking, and I'm
begging for information.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to
tap into my guides.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And I prayed to God and I prayed
to my family, who can help me,

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:90%
and my guides and angels.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.520 align:middle line:84%
I start to get
certain information.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'm writing it down.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.360 align:middle line:90%
And repeat offender, two boys.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.715 align:middle line:90%
So I write that down.

00:39:27.715 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Then I start to ask
his spirit or his,

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:35.050 align:middle line:84%
belonging to him, spirit guides,
everything who ties to him,

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:36.740 align:middle line:90%
stadium lights, like, off.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.990 align:middle line:90%
And all this is on my website.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:39.532 align:middle line:84%
You can see my
automatic hand drawing

00:39:39.532 --> 00:39:40.700 align:middle line:90%
on my website about this.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.408 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: Yes, we
can see the pictures.

00:39:42.408 --> 00:39:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>THOMAS: So I draw the four
stadium lights, like, off.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.382 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, that night, they
were off when he went missing.

00:39:51.382 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So there's the four
stadium lights.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.950 align:middle line:90%
I said, give me a name.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:54.750 align:middle line:90%
John.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So by the stadium
lights, I put "John."

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you stood on the
porch of the murderer's home,

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and you looked directly
through the little clearing,

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Papa John Stadium's right there.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.890 align:middle line:90%
So I ask, I need more.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Where exactly are you?

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:12.993 align:middle line:84%
And I see construction,
orange vests.

00:40:12.993 --> 00:40:14.410 align:middle line:84%
They were doing
construction right

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:19.000 align:middle line:84%
in front of the murderer's
home, and they had the flags,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.280 align:middle line:90%
the men with the orange vests.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, Cesar was playing
with the flags, pulling them

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:30.170 align:middle line:84%
out, ended up in his home,
and that's what happened.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The point of
that clip, Mark, is you,

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.047 align:middle line:84%
too, have had some kind of
supernatural experiences

00:40:35.047 --> 00:40:36.130 align:middle line:90%
with Dorothy, haven't you?

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: I want to give
you example of that, too.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.190 align:middle line:84%
With Dorothy, no question she
wanted me to write her story.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to think she wanted
me to write Marilyn's story.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:47.192 align:middle line:84%
This is a "Photoplay" magazine
from way back in 1962, OK?

00:40:47.192 --> 00:40:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even have
anything on the cover that

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:51.070 align:middle line:84%
would give you any
idea that there

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:90%
was anything important in here.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: OK?

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.540 align:middle line:84%
But Dorothy, I think,
wanted me to read this,

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.430 align:middle line:90%
and I think Marilyn did, too.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.275 align:middle line:84%
"One year, later
Marilyn Monroe's killer

00:40:59.275 --> 00:41:00.550 align:middle line:90%
is still at large."

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, see if this portrait
gives you an idea--

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who wrote that?

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:06.683 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: --of who the killer was.

00:41:06.683 --> 00:41:10.330 align:middle line:84%
It was a little known
European journalist.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I've never been able to find
her, didn't find out much about

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:13.910 align:middle line:90%
her.

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.623 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Donaldson.

00:41:15.623 --> 00:41:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Here's what she wrote.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.980 align:middle line:90%
"You can see him in a crowd.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.490 align:middle line:84%
You can reach out and touch
him, because he is a great man,

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:23.770 align:middle line:90%
famous all over the world.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that
touch will give you

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.070 align:middle line:90%
at least a small part of him.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.890 align:middle line:84%
You can see him on television
or even in a movie theater,

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and you will look
up to him and think

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.210 align:middle line:84%
how lucky his wife is
to be married to him

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and how lucky the children
are to have him as a father.

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you'll think,
I wish I were his wife.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.010 align:middle line:84%
You can read about him almost
every day in the Washington

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.810 align:middle line:90%
newspaper--"

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --"in magazines,
and you will think,

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:48.160 align:middle line:90%
this is a good person.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.190 align:middle line:84%
This is a truly honorable
man, but while you will never

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:55.060 align:middle line:84%
read, never see, never know
is that this man is a killer.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.032 align:middle line:84%
He is the man who
killed Marilyn Monroe."

00:41:57.032 --> 00:41:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we know who
she was talking about?

00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Absolutely.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Bobby Kennedy.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And the article
goes on without ever

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:05.440 align:middle line:84%
naming him, talks about
all the children and Ethel

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.600 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.800 align:middle line:84%
This was all out there,
but nobody ever found it.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.430 align:middle line:90%
And so this--

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was--

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: --came to me just like
that came to that gentleman

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:13.650 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I think I was supposed to find
this "Photoplay" magazine,

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe so.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Absolutely.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe so.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:24.043 align:middle line:84%
So where are we today with
Dorothy Kilgallen's murder?

00:42:24.043 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Well, with Dorothy--

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I'd
connect this in--

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying to
get the NYPD cold case

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.420 align:middle line:90%
squad to investigate her death.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.483 align:middle line:84%
Detective Phillip Panzarella
got in touch with me

00:42:33.483 --> 00:42:34.900 align:middle line:84%
about three months
ago and told me

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.108 align:middle line:90%
he was going to look into it.

00:42:36.108 --> 00:42:37.840 align:middle line:90%
I haven't heard from him since.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.180 align:middle line:84%
The parallel there is
the one with Marilyn.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And I do show in
"Collateral Damage"

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.770 align:middle line:84%
how I believe that
she was killed.

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I have my own
theory in the book,

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and then I've recently come
across two other accounts that

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.530 align:middle line:84%
confirm exactly what
I wrote about the fact

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:84%
that Bobby Kennedy and Peter
Lawford were at Marilyn's home

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.100 align:middle line:84%
on the afternoon she died,
tried to talk her in-- talk

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:01.360 align:middle line:90%
her out of going to the media.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tried to
calm her down, right?

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Right.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.930 align:middle line:84%
She refused, and then
my account basically

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:07.240 align:middle line:84%
shows how operatives
of Bobby Kennedy's came

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.990 align:middle line:90%
to Marilyn's home.

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I used clues from the autopsy
that people can read about

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and how, then,
they overcame her,

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:20.710 align:middle line:84%
how they went ahead and used
these barbiturates to infect

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:24.940 align:middle line:84%
her body, not by her ingesting
them-- by another method.

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Then I found a woman
in Massachusetts

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.800 align:middle line:84%
recently, who gave almost the
same account to me from what

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.160 align:middle line:84%
she knew from her father
and the two men who told her

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.800 align:middle line:84%
about exactly how
Bobby had been there

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.145 align:middle line:84%
and had left the window
open in the bedroom,

00:43:41.145 --> 00:43:42.520 align:middle line:84%
so these operatives
could get in.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.103 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: To let these
perpetrators in.

00:43:44.103 --> 00:43:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And then there is a
relative of Joe DiMaggio's,

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.610 align:middle line:84%
who has an account that
I've now come across,

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:50.210 align:middle line:90%
who talks about the same thing.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.480 align:middle line:84%
But he even goes
further with the fact

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.260 align:middle line:84%
that Joe DiMaggio's mother was
on the telephone with Marilyn

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Monroe.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:43:59.000 align:middle line:84%
They were talking
and everything,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and then she heard an
intruder or intruders.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:04.240 align:middle line:90%
She heard a scream.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:84%
She heard a name,
and then Marilyn--

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:09.830 align:middle line:84%
the phone kind of went dead,
but it was never hung up.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, Marilyn was
found with the phone in her--

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.080 align:middle line:90%
in her hand when she died.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So those accounts show the
means of what happened there.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I sent my book, "Collateral
Damage," a 375-page evidence

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:28.060 align:middle line:84%
report pointing to Robert
F Kennedy as not only being

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:29.560 align:middle line:84%
complicit in Marilyn's
death, but it

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.990 align:middle line:90%
being covered up by the LAPD.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:33.370 align:middle line:90%
And the autopsy--

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know Noguchi who

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:39.400 align:middle line:84%
handled that, Thomas Noguchi,
decided afterwards he had

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.720 align:middle line:90%
made a few mistakes, George.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.553 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just a few.

00:44:41.553 --> 00:44:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: He actually
forgot to look

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:47.050 align:middle line:84%
at some of Marilyn's
inner organs,

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.900 align:middle line:84%
so that just-- the autopsy
was just botched there.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:51.640 align:middle line:84%
If you ever want to
cover up a murder,

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:55.660 align:middle line:84%
just falsify the autopsies--
happened in all three cases--

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.880 align:middle line:90%
JFK's, Marilyn, and Dorothy.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I sent all this to
the LA district attorney,

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:05.130 align:middle line:84%
George Gascon, demanding that he
reinvestigate Marilyn's death.

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.380 align:middle line:90%
To date, that hasn't happened.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.922 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
are the odds, Mark,

00:45:07.922 --> 00:45:11.740 align:middle line:84%
of three people who are
intertwined in their lives

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.950 align:middle line:84%
all dying within several
years of each other?

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.870 align:middle line:90%
That defies logic.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: You're right on point.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.260 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'm amazed at it myself.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Within 40 months, you've got--

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:30.452 align:middle line:84%
Marilyn died at 36,
JFK, 46, Dorothy, 52.

00:45:30.452 --> 00:45:31.410 align:middle line:90%
All of them died young.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.847 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: '62, '63, '65--

00:45:33.847 --> 00:45:35.430 align:middle line:84%
the years that all
three of them died.

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: And you've got, then,
Bobby, obviously, dying in '68.

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: '68.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: These were tragic,
tragic, violent times.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did we get
through as a people?

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.540 align:middle line:84%
How did we make
it after all this?

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: That's the relevance
of this book and the other ones

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.630 align:middle line:90%
that I've written, I think.

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Nobody asked questions.

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:56.640 align:middle line:84%
They accepted J Edgar
Hoover's Oswald Alone theory.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who said that the
moment Kennedy was killed

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:00.400 align:middle line:90%
that he was the lone assassin.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.692 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Told the justice
department and everybody else,

00:46:02.692 --> 00:46:05.040 align:middle line:84%
don't let anybody think
it's anyone else, because--

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.380 align:middle line:84%
he did that because if it's
a nut like Lee Harvey Oswald,

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:10.650 align:middle line:84%
he and the FBI can't
be held responsible.

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:12.600 align:middle line:84%
But if there's a plot
to kill the president--

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They should
have known about it.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.702 align:middle line:84%
>>SHAW: Yeah, then we get
to Dorothy's death, OK?

00:46:15.702 --> 00:46:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's no
way that anybody

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.020 align:middle line:90%
asked any questions about that.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Because they were scared--

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:24.480 align:middle line:84%
her family "What's
My Line" people,

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.230 align:middle line:90%
her newspaper colleagues.

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.030 align:middle line:90%
They were scared.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:30.730 align:middle line:84%
If they knew she was working
on the JFK assassination,

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:34.540 align:middle line:84%
so if whoever killed JFK
is now coming after her,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.790 align:middle line:90%
they're not going to speak up.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.650 align:middle line:10%
>>SHAW: And then
with Marilyn's death,

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.600 align:middle line:10%
the truth was out
there everywhere.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.320 align:middle line:10%
I've got all of these accounts
in newspapers and these books

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.210 align:middle line:10%
and everything else of
everybody screaming,

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.700 align:middle line:10%
including Dorothy, that
it wasn't a suicide.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.660 align:middle line:10%
But you know what?

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they gave
a damn about Marilyn.

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:54.510 align:middle line:84%
They saw her as this dumb
blonde, which she wasn't.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:58.920 align:middle line:84%
She was-- she was a human being,
who loved and cared for people.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The only thing she ever
wanted to do was be a mother.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.910 align:middle line:90%
You talked about her upbringing.

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was just sad, but nobody
really questioned anything.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
point of my books.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Stop and think.

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Ask questions today,
especially when

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:13.770 align:middle line:84%
the government's
involved or somebody as

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:14.940 align:middle line:90%
powerful as the Kennedys.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Mark Shaw, you are a
national treasure, my friend.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SHAW: Oh, my.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.575 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about that,
but thank you so much.

00:47:19.575 --> 00:47:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Keep doing
what you're doing.

It's good to know that
somebody like Mark

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.730 align:middle line:10%
Shaw, a dedicated
reporter and investigator,

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.340 align:middle line:10%
won't let these stories go.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe the deaths of these
three individuals, one day,

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.880 align:middle line:90%
will be vindicated.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
