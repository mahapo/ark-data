Maureen St. Germain is with us,
the founder of the St. Germain

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:10%
Mystery School, Akashic Records
International, and the author

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:10%
of well-known books.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
Known as a practical
mystic, she teaches a course

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:84%
on how to access your higher
self called the Ascension

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Maureen.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MAURINE ST. GERMAIN: Hi.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.985 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here.

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.987 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
the Ascension Institute.

00:00:42.987 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: The
Ascension Institute

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:10%
is a year-long program
where I take people

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:10%
through a lot of
esoteric training

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of information that
they can use in everyday life.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:10%
They call me the
practical mystic

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:10%
because I like to apply
what I learn in the mystics.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you create this?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:10%
This particular training, called
the higher self connection,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:10%
I created after--

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.960 align:middle line:10%
I worked with it for seven
years before I released it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.105 align:middle line:10%
to the general public.

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I would take it to my
classes and teach it to them,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:90%
and then get their feedback.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's just three easy steps.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And after a 45-day
practice period,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:84%
you have very good connection
with your higher self.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
male, logical way

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.045 align:middle line:84%
to learn because a
lot of people just--

00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:90%
we're thinkers.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And so letting go of that
busy mind or the monkey mind

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:90%
is hard.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:10%
So you practice this
very simple set of tools,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.542 align:middle line:10%
and you're off and running.

00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And I can share it
with you, if you want.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.708 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
we'll get into that.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:90%
What are the higher dimensions?

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, I
believe that we are coexisting

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:10%
in the first three dimensions,
but we don't realize it

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:10%
because we're so used
to it, and that we're

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:10%
in third dimension in
our physical expression,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.550 align:middle line:10%
and that the higher dimensions
have certain qualities that we

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:10%
can start to acquire because
we're moving out of this age,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:10%
from the Kali Yuga, to a new
age, where we will be relying

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:10%
on our connection with each
other more telepathically

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:10%
than by our cell phones.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: So
the higher dimensions

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:90%
have different qualities.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody talks about the
fifth dimension and that higher

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
place where we have choices, but
the choices to hurt one another

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:90%
don't exist.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:10%
So it's a bit like having
all the choices in the world,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:10%
but the choice that would
cause you pain, my friend,

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.380 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't show up.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.080 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't come up in my
awareness or a possibility.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's another way of being.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
game, as I call it.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.153 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maureen, what
is the fifth dimension?

00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Fifth dimension
is a vibrational data

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:90%
set that we are all becoming.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:84%
It is the same as what I
would call the ascension.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.277 align:middle line:84%
So the fifth dimension
is that place

00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:84%
that we are becoming
where we're going

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:90%
to become the ascended masters.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're all becoming ascended
masters, whether we're ready

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's funny
because a lot of people

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.798 align:middle line:84%
don't realize that they're
becoming an ascended master.

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
a fourth dimension?

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes, there is.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's that?

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.392 align:middle line:90%
And why did we skip that?

00:03:23.392 --> 00:03:25.975 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: [LAUGHS] I like
to say it's like Grand Central.

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to go
there to spend the night.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the place you go to where
there are emotional feelings.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.100 align:middle line:10%
It's still polarity, but
it's much faster than this 3D

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:10%
environment we're in.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So our thoughts become
reality much faster.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen it
in movies depicted

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:84%
where we see someone who has
shifted into a lower vibration

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:90%
and they're scared all the time.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And that fourth
dimensional vibration

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:90%
is a way-shower into the fifth.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.480 align:middle line:90%
So it's very close to third.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.592 align:middle line:84%
But because it moves so
fast, if you're moving up,

00:04:01.592 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:90%
you move right up into fifth.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:84%
If you're moving down,
you kind of decelerate

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:90%
into a lower level of fourth.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's easier to
jump from the third dimension

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:90%
to the fifth dimension--

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Mhm,
just like in music.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and
bypass the fourth?

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.997 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Just like in music.

00:04:13.997 --> 00:04:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who are
listening who are musicians,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.270 align:middle line:84%
you know that the
major triad 1-3-5

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:90%
is very easy to sing or say.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
But when you land on that
fourth and you hold it,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.770 align:middle line:84%
you want to go
down to the third,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
or you want to go
back up to the fifth,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and then the fifth
takes you to the octave.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.465 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you move
into these dimensions?

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: You
make clear intention

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to do it.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.615 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that's
very interesting because just

00:04:37.615 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
by saying, I want to wake up
in 5D, it makes a difference.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
You act proactively,
so you choose

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
words that are allowing you to
express what's really going on

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
in your world, rather than a
negative way of putting it.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.753 align:middle line:84%
So people who fly at night
on an overnight flight,

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.920 align:middle line:84%
they might call it the red
eye, or you could call it

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:90%
the shut eye, you see?

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:90%
So there's fun ways to do that.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Some people talk
about a ex-wife.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
well, what do you

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.898 align:middle line:90%
call a previously owned car?

00:05:10.898 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And you would call it a
used car in the old days,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.408 align:middle line:84%
but now it's a
certified pre-owned car.

00:05:15.408 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
It sounds pretty special.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.482 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pre-owned does.

00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And you get money
for it this time.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.107 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: That's right.

00:05:20.107 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So then, the spouse
or the partner,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:84%
instead of calling them the ex
because you don't like them,

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.730 align:middle line:84%
or the former because
you're trying to be nice,

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
you could just say, well,
that was her practice husband.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or call them the
pre-owned wife, right?

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: For
sure, for sure.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 5D.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:90%
What is 5D exactly?

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I believe 5D is
the vibration that we emanate

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:84%
when we're in our place of
joy, when we're in our hearts,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and we're aligned
with our divine plan.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like this.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.070 align:middle line:84%
When someone comes to your
door, maybe it's your neighbor

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and you know them, but you
weren't expecting them.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.652 align:middle line:84%
You're going to say,
well come on in.

00:05:58.652 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Have a cup of coffee
or something with me.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't think
to not do that.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.432 align:middle line:90%
That's how we look at--

00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's being polite.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.098 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
You're being polite.

00:06:07.098 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So in 5D, all the choices that
are hurtful don't occur to us.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And in 5D, I'm so sensitive
to the person that's--

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't just mean me.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Anyone, when they're
vibrating at 5D,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:84%
they're aware that the
next thing they say

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:90%
might be hurtful.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And so they change their
words, or different words

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.633 align:middle line:90%
come out of their mouth.

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting
take on that.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.843 align:middle line:90%
Is there a 6D?

00:06:29.843 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes, there
is, and that's where

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.965 align:middle line:90%
we go when we're dreaming.

00:06:33.965 --> 00:06:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's intriguing.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.292 align:middle line:84%
You had mentioned
three steps earlier.

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Oh, yes.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.125 align:middle line:84%
Three steps to connect
with your higher self.

00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:41.083 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:06:41.083 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: The first one
is you do a practice period

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
for 45 days where you ask
unimportant, insignificant

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:90%
questions from your higher self.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To whom?

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Your higher self.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.850 align:middle line:84%
You first do a little
meditation where

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:84%
you ask your higher self
to show you a symbol

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:90%
or signal in your body.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And what's very interesting
is people get a visual.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Some people get colors.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Some people get a
tickle on their ear.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:84%
One lady reported that
she got an itchy ear.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
In the meditation, she was
asking her higher self,

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:84%
show me my sign or
my signal for yes,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and then her toe
started to itch.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And she keeps telling herself
now, body, quiet down.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Calm down.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And finally, her whole
body started to itch.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So then she said,
OK, OK, I get it.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll take the itchy
ear for my yes signal.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of thing
happens in the environment

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:84%
when you first just quiet
yourself and ask in meditation,

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd like my symbol or signal
for yes, no, and neutral.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:90%
And you do each one separately.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So people get different kinds of
symbols, but 90% of the people

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:84%
that I take them through
this, they get it.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the other 10%,
I have a workaround for.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
is using that symbol

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:84%
for 45 days asking unimportant,
insignificant questions.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Insignificant.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.455 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And so you don't
ask about-- if you're a smoker,

00:08:03.455 --> 00:08:05.610 align:middle line:84%
you don't ask about
that next smoke.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:10%
And if you like sweets, you
don't ask about the cookie.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you ask about
things you're willing to do.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So you ask, is it in my
highest, best good to have

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:90%
eggs for breakfast?

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.555 align:middle line:84%
Is it in my highest
and best good

00:08:15.555 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:84%
to take this route
over that route?

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you keep asking until
you get either a yes or a no.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, the second rule is
you always follow through.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:10%
And the third rule
is, for people

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:10%
who like to use pendulums or
muscle testing or kinesiology,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:10%
you set all that
aside for six weeks.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is the same reason

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
why you wouldn't learn
German and French.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why six weeks?

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Why not four?

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.346 align:middle line:90%
Why not five?

00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: According to
a well-known chiropractor,

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
it takes six weeks
to get new DNA.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm drawing a
blank at his name.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Danny Epstein.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
If we get new DNA
in six weeks, that

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
means that your body
has regenerated,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and that practice, whatever
it is, is permanent.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:10%
So just like in the
day before cell phones,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:10%
you might pick up
the phone and know

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:10%
that it's your mom or
some well-known guest

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:10%
that you want to talk to.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:10%
And you just know
that intuitively.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And so without
looking at your phone,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:90%
you could play with it that way.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Is this my friend?

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:90%
And then look at the phone.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, the six weeks of
practice is all about play.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why you ask
about unimportant stuff,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:84%
so that you can see in hindsight
how amazing the higher self

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.360 align:middle line:90%
answers can be.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So you might ask
about a restaurant.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it my highest, best good
to go to this restaurant?

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:90%
What about this restaurant?

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:90%
What about this restaurant?

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
You show up, and somebody that
you've been wanting to talk to

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:90%
is there, and you talk to them.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.445 align:middle line:84%
Stuff like that
starts to happen.

00:09:46.445 --> 00:09:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And that's
when you realize, oh, yeah,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.425 align:middle line:84%
my higher self
has got the goods,

00:09:49.425 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:84%
even when I don't know
what the goods are.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, talking
about 5D, Sheila Gillette

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:84%
channels the THEO
group, and she talks

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:03.532 align:middle line:84%
about releasing limited beliefs
to live in the area of 5D.

00:10:03.532 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEILA GILLETTE:
THEO has brought forth

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:10%
a program called Soul
Integration, which

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.810 align:middle line:10%
is assisting people in
releasing, or learning how

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:10%
to release, limiting
beliefs that keep them

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:10%
from living lives they
really want to live and dream

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:10%
about living.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.160 align:middle line:10%
And it's just our
limiting beliefs

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.535 align:middle line:10%
that keep us from doing that,
thinking that we can't, we

00:10:25.535 --> 00:10:27.590 align:middle line:10%
don't have enough,
whatever it is.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.510 align:middle line:84%
THEO's just started talking
about unconditional love.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And unconditional love,
they said, is not a feeling.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.677 align:middle line:90%
It's a state of being.

00:10:37.677 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And we thought, that
was really interesting.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And exploring that, we found
out it's being soul centered,

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:84%
feeling comfortable
in our own skin,

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:84%
no matter what's
happening in our life.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.470 align:middle line:84%
As they say, being the
eye of the hurricane.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Because in the hurricane,
the eye is very calm.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But the wind swirling
about it and in our lives,

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:84%
it's like that sometimes with
challenges and conditions.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But if we can stay calm
we can respond to life

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:90%
rather than react.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Look what's happened in
just the last 100 years.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
The momentum, now that
we're in the fifth dimension

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and its more refined
vibration, that we're

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.870 align:middle line:84%
ready to recognize the
master beings that we are,

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.680 align:middle line:90%
that our souls--

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
larger than we can
possibly imagine.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And that we've chosen this human
experience, this Earth suit,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
to navigate this planet,
but how exquisite it is.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And what's going to be happening
is just this continued momentum

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.400 align:middle line:90%
of upleveling our lives.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who can access
the fifth dimension?

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Anybody can.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can children do it too?

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Mhm.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Yes, actually, children
are more likely to be

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:90%
in 5D all the time.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.670 align:middle line:84%
One of my little grandchildren
stood up in class,

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:90%
and she's only four.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And she said, somebody in
the room is really sad.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's all give each other a hug.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:90%
And this is a pre-kindergartner.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.732 align:middle line:90%
How did she pick that up?

00:12:07.732 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Because she's
intuitive and she could feel--

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just
she's tuned in.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:12.668 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
She's already at 5D.

00:12:12.668 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that's so important

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.653 align:middle line:84%
that I like to tell people
is if everything is funny--

00:12:19.653 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:90%
oh, I got a flat tire.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.520 align:middle line:90%
I can't make the meeting.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Ha ha ha, you know?

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ha ha ha, yeah.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: You
find the joy, and you

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.990 align:middle line:84%
find yourself laughing about
stuff that, in 3D, we would be,

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:90%
oh, man.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
My boss is going to be
mad, blah, blah, blah.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
different environment.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you can't laugh
about everything, though,

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Maureen.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.080 align:middle line:90%
I stepped on a nail.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Ha ha ha?

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.838 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: No, I
wouldn't laugh about that.

00:12:42.838 --> 00:12:44.635 align:middle line:84%
But what if the
person you meet is

00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:84%
somebody you needed to meet
when they fixed you up?

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I guess what I'm saying
is, the circumstances

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:84%
that she was describing,
some of the more difficult

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
circumstances, as you look at
it from a much bigger vantage

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.890 align:middle line:84%
point, you don't find that
you're as stressed from it

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:04.240 align:middle line:84%
or as worked up over it, and
you can find the humor in it.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a gift to be
able to let things roll off to

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.145 align:middle line:90%
and roll off you.

00:13:09.145 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, we're
all going to start doing that.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to stop
insulting each other

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:90%
and hurting each other--

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When?

00:13:15.585 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Pretty soon.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I hope so.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I think so.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I think it's
out of control right now.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.018 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Back to the
children for a little bit.

00:13:23.018 --> 00:13:26.367 align:middle line:84%
How does a parent react to their
kid who's got this ability?

00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well,
the first thing to know

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
is, if your child is
fearless, you probably

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
have an ascended
master on your hands.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And that means that that child
is born into your family,

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
but they've already achieved
a spiritual mastery,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:84%
like the Buddha or the
Christ or Muhammad,

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and they are here to be
part of the solution.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to have
a childhood experience,

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
so they spend their
childhood testing

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.830 align:middle line:90%
the limits of their skill.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.848 align:middle line:90%
And they do wacky stuff.

00:13:58.848 --> 00:14:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Think of Superman when he was
learning how to lift something,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.265 align:middle line:84%
and he would lift it,
and it would go flying.

00:14:03.265 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would
be the implication.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So the parents are in
a dilemma because they

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:84%
can't use any kind of
the traditional things

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.410 align:middle line:90%
that they know.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:15.827 align:middle line:90%
That won't work for that child.

00:14:15.827 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
They'll talk to that child
till they're blue in the face

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:90%
and won't even impact the child.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So the thing that
the parent needs

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
to understand is
they need to keep

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:84%
doing their own meditations
so that when something

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:84%
happens and they're now upset
with the child for whatever,

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
they have the wisdom
that's coming through them

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:84%
on what to say, and to
take a moment and say, God,

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:90%
what do I say?

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting about this

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
is it also means you don't
tell them what they did

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:84%
was wrong because they
won't understand that.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they won't
agree with it either.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And they
won't agree with it.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
But what you can tell
them is, not everybody

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:90%
is able to see what you see.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And while you might be seeing
more than everybody else,

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:84%
you need to understand that
other kids will copy you.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not
safe for everyone,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.903 align:middle line:90%
you can't be doing it.

00:15:11.903 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to
understand that you're

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.120 align:middle line:84%
going to cause a problem
for somebody else.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Because those children have a
big responsibility to humanity.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So when you explain why
they can't do something

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, quote, "the benefit
of the larger group of people,"

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
whether it's their classroom
or their town, they get that.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Then that's their motivation
to change their behavior.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But you can't say,
you're grounded.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
You can't say, you're not going
to get your driver's license.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.613 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:15:39.613 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You can't
punish them for this.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.405 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: That's right,
you can't punish them.

00:15:43.405 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:84%
You simply have to explain
how their behavior adversely

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
affects the family,
the world, like that.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:90%
And then you'll make progress.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's not easy, you know?

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a big responsibility.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of them out there.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm an
Akashic Records guide

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and I teach people about
the Akashic Records,

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:84%
I have had many
clients who've asked,

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.780 align:middle line:90%
what do I do with my son?

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:90%
He's fearless.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I hear that
word "fearless" from a parent,

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:16:13.675 --> 00:16:15.563 align:middle line:84%
Do we pick our parents
before we're born?

00:16:15.563 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Mhm, I think we do.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.688 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that's the only factor.

00:16:18.688 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:10%
I think sometimes
we are choosing

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:26.240 align:middle line:10%
to have an opportunity.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And I like to say
that sometimes you

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:84%
just get on the freight
train because it's

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.480 align:middle line:90%
going where you want to be.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.047 align:middle line:84%
And that you know it's a wreck,
you know you can handle it,

00:16:33.047 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
come out the other side.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.210 align:middle line:84%
We know plenty of people who
have had terrible childhood.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.153 align:middle line:84%
And yet, as adults,
they're magical.

00:16:40.153 --> 00:16:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, other people have
had a terrible childhood

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and have succumbed
to those damages.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So I think part of it is
sometimes it's timing,

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.377 align:middle line:84%
but it's always you're
accepting that you've

00:16:52.377 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:90%
chosen your parents.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a great story
from the McGareys,

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:84%
the two doctors who worked
very closely with Edgar Cayce.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:10%
And the older boy
was being scolded.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:10%
They were maybe three
and six, the children.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:10%
And Gladys McGarey, the
wife, the female doctor,

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:10%
said to her son, you decided
to be part of this family.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:90%
You chose us.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at his little
sister and said, yeah,

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know she was coming
when I agreed to come with you.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So we are always surprised
by how things unfold.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yeah.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.653 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they know
they have these abilities?

00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: No, no.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.287 align:middle line:84%
They don't know that
they're unusual.

00:17:36.287 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Because their
energy and their belief

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:90%
system is innocent.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have a concept
that they're so unusual,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
or that people can't
do what they can do.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They get
frustrated fast?

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, I don't
think it frustrates them,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:84%
but they're curious on
why everybody else can't

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:90%
do what they can do, you see?

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Because again, they
don't look at--

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That evolves when
they get older too, right?

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Mm-hmm.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, then they take on some
of the human characteristics

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:84%
of 3D, which are judging and
belief systems, like what

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:84%
she was describing, the limiting
beliefs that we've accepted,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:90%
that we don't need to accept.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So an ascended master
child is someone

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
who will test his or her parents
and push them to the limits.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:10%
They may or may
not be spiritual,

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.460 align:middle line:10%
but they will definitely
be part of the solution.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And they carry with them
mastery that shows up

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:90%
in spite of adverse conditions.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, I had great
parents when I was a kid.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle line:90%
My mother is still alive.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:42.640 align:middle line:90%
She's 94.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:84%
My father passed
away when he was 88.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:84%
But I must have done a
good job picking them

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:90%
because they were phenomenal.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.350 align:middle line:84%
What happens to a child who
picks the wrong parents?

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we've heard of
horrible parents before.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Mhm.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, in one Akashic
Records reading,

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:05.920 align:middle line:84%
a woman asked about her father,
who had sexually abused.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, this.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: --she
didn't complain

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:10%
about what had happened,
but she wanted to understand

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.670 align:middle line:10%
why would she
choose such parents.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And the record keepers
through me said to her,

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:90%
you came to stop the madness.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:10%
And she gasped, and
she said, that's true.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.248 align:middle line:84%
When he started to go after my
younger brothers and sisters--

00:19:29.248 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She put her foot down.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.998 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: She
stood in his way

00:19:31.998 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:90%
and offered herself in service.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'll never
understand that, though.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll never understand
his side of it.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.980 align:middle line:90%
There's no excuse.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yeah,
from my vantage point,

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.340 align:middle line:84%
it's what people
have experienced.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think, too, it's
a little bit like drugs.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we get pulled in.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
A person gets pulled in, and
they can't find their way out.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a known
fact that most abusers have

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:90%
been abused.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.758 align:middle line:84%
So they're just
doing what they know.

00:20:06.758 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They pass it on.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Right.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And despite what people say,
these experiences leave a mark.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.370 align:middle line:10%
So the person who
plows through that

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:10%
and comes out the other side is
that highly evolved being that

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:10%
took on the role to put an
end to it, to stand up for it,

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:10%
maybe found an organization
that helps people.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And they arrive and
emerge unscathed.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:10%
But those are special people
that took the ticket in because

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:10%
of the timing or the
situation, not necessarily

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:10%
the parents and the
way they behave.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would you
say is our higher self?

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.853 align:middle line:90%
How would you define that?

00:20:51.853 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: In
common terms, it

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:84%
would be the equivalent of
what most of the religions

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:90%
teach us is heaven.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:90%
So in heaven, supposedly--

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm making this up.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- we have a body,
and we're friendly with people,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and we can talk to Saint Peter.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's this quality
of no pain, no suffering,

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:84%
no conflict all the
things that we have here

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:90%
that are problematic.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So your higher self
is kind of like that,

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:84%
but your higher self is
plugged in to your connection

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:90%
to Source, or God.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.790 align:middle line:84%
What that does for you
is gives you access

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:32.360 align:middle line:84%
to the information that
may be helpful to you

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.010 align:middle line:90%
that you don't know about.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion,
when I was working

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:84%
in as the PR person
for a non-profit,

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.450 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to
call the newspaper,

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and I was calling the reporter
three or four times that day

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.830 align:middle line:84%
trying to get my
story in the news.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:90%
You are a good PR person.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: [CHUCKLES]
And I never got through.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.540 align:middle line:90%
It always went to voicemail.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I practiced
the higher self work,

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:84%
my higher self came in
at five minutes till 5:00

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:01.440 align:middle line:90%
and said to me, call this guy.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, I'm tired.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.020 align:middle line:90%
My kids are already home.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:90%
They're waiting for dinner.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing it.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Call the guy.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm hungry.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.470 align:middle line:90%
It's five minutes till 5:00.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:90%
Call the guy.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So I tell people, it's OK
once you get your higher self

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:84%
connection to argue
with your higher self.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But the third time,
you follow through.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.315 align:middle line:84%
So I called, and
his name was Doug.

00:22:24.315 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He picks up.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.315 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: He picks up.

00:22:26.315 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Maureen,
how could you possibly

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
know that I would be
here at this time.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And all I could do
was laugh because I

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
couldn't very well tell him,
oh, yeah, well, my higher self--

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I called
42 times, right?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: [LAUGHS]
So the next day,

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.582 align:middle line:84%
my story made the front
page of the largest

00:22:41.582 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:90%
newspaper in the state.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.323 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about that.

00:22:44.323 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Timing.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: But
I wouldn't have

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:10%
had that window if it hadn't
been for my higher self

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:10%
connection.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maureen, Meg Benedicte
is the author of the book "Soul

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Realized," and describes
when she connected

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:90%
with her own higher self.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.750 align:middle line:10%
>>MEG BENEDICTE: I
had my angelic soul

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.970 align:middle line:10%
be able to come into
the body, walk in,

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:10%
and see through a
whole new perspective,

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:10%
be able to determine and see
where we are locked down,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:10%
where the time barriers and
the density was creating,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.860 align:middle line:10%
in a sense, a mental amnesia.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And so when this
unlocks, then everything

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
starts to become very
clear, and immediately

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.190 align:middle line:84%
had the channel to my higher
self to get the steps,

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:90%
get the guidance.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:84%
How do I, in a sense, get free
of this prison of my density

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and the three dimensional time
matrix consciousness that's

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.460 align:middle line:84%
running in all of
us, creating fear

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:90%
and duality and separation?

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So as we increase our frequency,
it helps our awakening.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.060 align:middle line:84%
When you go higher
and higher frequency,

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:84%
it begins to dissolve that time
barrier and the amnesia that's

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:84%
been running in
us for centuries.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much of
a freeing experience

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and a liberating experience and
it opens you to, in a sense,

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.800 align:middle line:84%
universal knowledge
and understanding.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And you start to bring the soul
presence into your biology.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.310 align:middle line:90%
This is a game changer.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.190 align:middle line:90%
This starts to change your DNA.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:84%
It starts to awaken the
dormant multi-dimensional DNA.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's exponentially
an ascension process

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:84%
into really living
your full potential,

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.570 align:middle line:84%
being all that you are, where we
came from such a limited state

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:90%
to being divine.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maureen, how important
is it to align ourselves

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.013 align:middle line:90%
with our higher dimension?

00:24:41.013 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: In
my opinion, it's

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.020 align:middle line:90%
the number one thing to learn.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.815 align:middle line:84%
Because after that, you
can ask your higher self,

00:24:46.815 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:84%
is it in my highest, best
good to take this course?

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Should I watch
this show on Gaia,

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:84%
or is there another show that's
a better choice for me tonight?

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is your
higher self guides you.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's no other choice
other than "Beyond Belief,"

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: [LAUGHS]
What was I thinking?

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.640 align:middle line:90%
That's probably true.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Today, my higher self
would for sure say that.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How easy is it to tap
into that higher dimension?

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Well, if you want,

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:84%
I can take you
through it right now.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:10%
It'll only take a few seconds.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, yeah.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.220 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to see it.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: OK, so as an
audience, if you're listening,

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
take a moment and put your
feet flat on the floor.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you feel like
it, you can close your eyes,

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:84%
but you can also
leave your eyes open.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to think
of a pet or an infant

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.395 align:middle line:84%
that you've had in your
arms at one time or another,

00:25:30.395 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and allow that feeling
of unconditional

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
love that you might feel
for that little one.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And say that to
yourself a few times.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, send a
beam of that love

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.657 align:middle line:90%
and light up your pranic tube.

00:25:45.657 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the tube in
front of your spine

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.090 align:middle line:90%
that runs the extra chi for you.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And let it connect with your
throat chakra, your third eye,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:56.270 align:middle line:84%
your crown chakra, all the
way up to the eighth chakra,

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:84%
where the portal to
your higher self is.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And now we invite the higher
self to join us in our hearts,

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.800 align:middle line:84%
following the same
path back down.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.948 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when I'm in
a good mood, I'll say,

00:26:07.948 --> 00:26:10.240 align:middle line:84%
imagine you're on a waterslide
and you're spiraling all

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:90%
the way down into your heart.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How often
do we do this?

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Daily?

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: We're
doing this once,

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to
get some information.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:90%
So now we're in the heart.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:84%
We've asked the higher
self to join us.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Ask your higher self to give you
your symbol or signal for yes.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:26.740 align:middle line:90%
And it could be a color.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.090 align:middle line:90%
It could be a shape.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It could be a thumbs down or a
thumbs up in your mind's eye.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:36.020 align:middle line:10%
It could be a sensation on one
side of the body or another.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Then ask your higher self,
show me my signal or a signal

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.790 align:middle line:90%
for no.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:44.540 align:middle line:10%
And again, it could
be a taste, a feeling

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:10%
in your physical body,
a color you might see,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:10%
or a shape you might see.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, once
again, say thank you.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Higher self, give me my
symbol or signal for neutral.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And neutral for most people is
very much of a straight line.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:10%
So they feel it in the
body as a big emptiness,

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:09.430 align:middle line:10%
or they feel it or see it in
their mind's eye as a horizon.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, for 45 days, you
ask unimportant questions

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and let that signal
come through.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
fun begins because--

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.792 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For 45 days?

00:27:19.792 --> 00:27:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: 45 days.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things you do
is you look at today's date,

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and then you tell yourself,
when is 45 days from now?

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's say today
is November 1.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.428 align:middle line:90%
45 days is December 15.

00:27:32.428 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're in to December.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.135 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Right.

00:27:35.135 --> 00:27:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So then you know
going forward, I'm

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.040 align:middle line:84%
going to do this practice
thing for 45 days.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.977 align:middle line:84%
So one day in Shanghai
when I was teaching,

00:27:43.977 --> 00:27:46.560 align:middle line:84%
this woman gets up in class and
said, why would my higher self

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.360 align:middle line:90%
lie to me?

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.290 align:middle line:84%
They'd been taught the
program the day before.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.530 align:middle line:90%
She was practicing it.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what did you ask?

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
I'm a vegan, and I

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.270 align:middle line:84%
asked my higher self if I
should have meat at breakfast.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.160 align:middle line:90%
And my higher self said yes.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
whole class is laughing.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.103 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her,
there's only three rules,

00:28:04.103 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and I think you
broke two of them.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Because she asked
about something

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.018 align:middle line:90%
she cared passionately about.

00:28:08.018 --> 00:28:09.540 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
she didn't care.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.722 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: She
wasn't willing to do it.

00:28:11.722 --> 00:28:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And I doubt seriously
if she followed through.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.180 align:middle line:84%
So the rules are pretty simple,
and it's simply the practice

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:90%
and having fun.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And some people say, well, I
can't think of 40 times a day

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.810 align:middle line:90%
an unimportant question.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And I said, then write
yourself a list of what

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.927 align:middle line:90%
you would be willing to ask.

00:28:27.927 --> 00:28:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's breakfast,
you get 10 of them.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Eggs?

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:30.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Cereal?

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Milk?

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.790 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Coffee?

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Tea?

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:34.680 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's pretty
easy to come up

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of unimportant stuff.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:10%
And then, you set aside
something that's important

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:10%
unless you must give that answer
because you have a deadline

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.920 align:middle line:10%
or something, and then you ask
your higher self, if you want.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But the whole idea of not
asking about important stuff

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and not checking it with your
pendulum or other resources

00:28:55.220 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:84%
is that you are practicing to
get the feel for what it's like

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:05.700 align:middle line:84%
so that you know the authentic
signal or symbol for you.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Once you have completed
your 45 days, what happens

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:84%
is your higher self
starts coming in

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:84%
with advance information that
you need that you didn't even

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.240 align:middle line:90%
know you needed.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.725 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it
ever let us down?

00:29:18.725 --> 00:29:21.540 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.075 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I think
more of a user failure.

00:29:24.075 --> 00:29:28.710 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not completely
centered or I'm not

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.690 align:middle line:84%
paying close
attention and I ask,

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.980 align:middle line:90%
I might not get a clear answer.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.010 align:middle line:84%
But I've never been
told by my higher self

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
to take an action step that
didn't have a huge payoff.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.930 align:middle line:90%
I've always been totally amazed.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why 45 days, Maureen?

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Why not 10?

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Why not 60?

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Why 45?

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Because it
takes 45 days to get new DNA.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that by
getting new DNA,

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:84%
you would have anchored that
feeling, that sensation,

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:59.820 align:middle line:84%
whatever it would be,
in your new cells,

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:90%
and you would go with that.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.180 align:middle line:84%
You'd have authenticity
at that point.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So by tapping
into your higher dimension,

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.568 align:middle line:84%
does that guarantee
you happiness?

00:30:09.568 --> 00:30:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, if I did--

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.570 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it does.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.250 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes I don't ask.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.730 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And it's when I
don't ask and I'm being--

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.290 align:middle line:84%
for me personally, and
I'm sure for everyone,

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.550 align:middle line:84%
the problem is sometimes
we are in our 3D self

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're reacting to something
that someone else said.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're self-conscious about
something and somebody makes

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.755 align:middle line:84%
a comment, you take it
personally, even when

00:30:32.755 --> 00:30:33.880 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't meant personally.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.992 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:30:34.992 --> 00:30:36.700 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And
then, of course, there

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.490 align:middle line:10%
are other energies
that can attack people.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And there is this whole
shift of dark energies

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.040 align:middle line:84%
that are leaving the planet,
but the ones that are left

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:90%
are kind of strong.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And so if they impact
someone, that energy

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.930 align:middle line:90%
can read what your sore spot is.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So a person might say
something and not even realize

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:90%
they're pushing your button.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you explode,
and then they explode,

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.957 align:middle line:84%
so sometimes those
things happen.

00:31:04.957 --> 00:31:06.040 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting thing.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you something
that happened with a client

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:90%
on the radio.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.870 align:middle line:84%
A man called in and
asked, what should I

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:90%
do about my adult daughter?

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm a meditator, I
taught meditation,

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and I was a good father,
blah, blah, blah.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:90%
And she's just horrible to me.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just can't reach her.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Mhm.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And the record keeper
said to him, you

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and your daughter were arch
enemies in a previous lifetime.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:84%
You went on and advanced
in your spiritual work,

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.860 align:middle line:90%
and she did not.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And in this lifetime, you
agreed to sponsor her.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And then they said,
she will come around,

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.250 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to take
a couple of years.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And you want to act as
if you already have it.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Instantly.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: First, you ask--

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.660 align:middle line:84%
you send the birthday
cards, you send

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.743 align:middle line:84%
the birthday presents,
whatever you would normally

00:31:55.743 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:84%
do if you were on good
terms, and let it unfold.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:02.727 align:middle line:84%
Then it actually happened to
me when I got fired from a job.

00:32:02.727 --> 00:32:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I had just written a check
for a couple thousand dollars

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:09.710 align:middle line:84%
for my son's tuition, and
sent it over to his house.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And I'm scared out of my mind--

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you have
the funds to back it?

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Oh,
the check was good.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.180 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have any money
left in savings for me,

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:90%
and I just lost my job.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You had no backup.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I had no backup.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And I was terrified.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.963 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
saying to myself, I

00:32:23.963 --> 00:32:25.880 align:middle line:84%
want to know when he's
going to appreciate me.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.672 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm thinking
of all the dumb things

00:32:27.672 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I've done, like
put myself at risk,

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:34.018 align:middle line:84%
not realizing that I
would be in this squeeze.

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Situation, yeah.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.550 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: So my
guides came in and said,

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:41.840 align:middle line:10%
when he's 26 or
28, and I burst out

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.415 align:middle line:10%
laughing because I was thinking,
next week would be good.

00:32:45.415 --> 00:32:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Or tomorrow would
be even better.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tomorrow would
be even better, right.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.967 align:middle line:84%
And at that age of 26
or 28, did it happen?

00:32:52.967 --> 00:32:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: They said 28, but
I didn't have to wait till he

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.260 align:middle line:84%
was 28 because when
I burst out laughing,

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.200 align:middle line:90%
I realized that I was still--

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.110 align:middle line:84%
even though I thought I was
OK, even though I thought

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any energy
on his lack of gratitude,

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.060 align:middle line:84%
apparently there
was something in me

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:84%
that was still holding
out an expectation.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And so when I laughed at
myself, I broke through that,

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't have to wait.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:18.400 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I was somehow
putting out an expectation,

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:84%
so I stopped even
looking for a thank you.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.380 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have to wait.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.817 align:middle line:90%
It took a few years.

00:33:23.817 --> 00:33:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I think he was probably
24 when it happened.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.952 align:middle line:10%
But I didn't have to wait till
he was 28, which was awesome.

00:33:28.952 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many helpers are
there in the fifth dimension?

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Or are we alone, just us and us?

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Oh.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that the ascended
masters and the beings of light

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.550 align:middle line:84%
who come through
channels are all

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.890 align:middle line:84%
coming from either
the fifth or higher.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:46.920 align:middle line:84%
They might even be coming
from higher dimensions.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's a vibrational data set.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So what we're dealing with
is there are many beings that

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.650 align:middle line:90%
are here to assist us.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing is
bringing our higher self,

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.710 align:middle line:84%
our ascended master
self, into this body.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's never
been done before.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing is
becoming ascended masters

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.120 align:middle line:90%
right here, right now.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.179 align:middle line:84%
And this is another thing
that's very interesting.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is fifth dimensional
at some time or another

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.530 align:middle line:84%
and don't realize it, and
then they slide back into 3D.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:20.708 align:middle line:90%
And I'll prove it to you.

00:34:20.708 --> 00:34:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
not a good place to be?

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.792 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, it's
good to be fifth dimensional,

00:34:24.792 --> 00:34:29.072 align:middle line:84%
but the thing is,
when we're in 5D,

00:34:29.072 --> 00:34:30.989 align:middle line:84%
we don't notice we're
in 5D because everything

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:32.433 align:middle line:90%
is so nice and smooth and rosy.

00:34:32.433 --> 00:34:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It's only when we slide back out
of it that we realize, oh, man,

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.879 align:middle line:90%
that was such a good vibe here.

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:37.679 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What happened, yeah.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.268 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Exactly.

00:34:39.268 --> 00:34:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So this evolution of
becoming 5D is a sine wave,

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:49.462 align:middle line:84%
and you are literally
riding in it,

00:34:49.462 --> 00:34:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and then sliding behind,
and then riding in it,

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.469 align:middle line:90%
and then sliding down.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And so here's an
example, and this

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:90%
happens to a lot of people.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.310 align:middle line:84%
They take something--
they come in the house,

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:03.960 align:middle line:84%
they put down their sunglasses,
and then they put them away.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.008 align:middle line:90%
And they're feeling good.

00:35:05.008 --> 00:35:07.050 align:middle line:84%
They got all the errands
done, and they sit down,

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:07.740 align:middle line:90%
and they do something.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And they remember, oh, man,
I forgot this one thing.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.903 align:middle line:90%
I need to go back out.

00:35:10.903 --> 00:35:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So they go to the same drawer
that they put the sunglasses

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:84%
in, and they go
for the sunglasses,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.390 align:middle line:90%
and they're not there.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: They're gone.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
your car keys.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: They
find an alternate.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.093 align:middle line:84%
They figure, well, maybe
there's another set in the car.

00:35:23.093 --> 00:35:24.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll use those.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:27.450 align:middle line:84%
They come back from that errand,
now happy again because they've

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.180 align:middle line:84%
finished that little
duty, and they

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.930 align:middle line:84%
open the drawer to put
away the sunglasses

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.340 align:middle line:90%
that they are holding--

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there they are.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.618 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: --and
they there they are.

00:35:34.618 --> 00:35:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, what really happened is
the person, when they came in

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:40.530 align:middle line:84%
from their errand, they were
happy, and they were joyful,

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:90%
and they were in 5D.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.520 align:middle line:84%
When they put the glasses
away, they were in 5D.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
now worried that they

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't finish everything, they
slipped back down into 3D.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Self-judgment, polarity stuff.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And when they opened the
door, they weren't there.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:36:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And this happened to me
many, many, many years ago.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.030 align:middle line:10%
And when it happened
a second time, and one

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.330 align:middle line:10%
of my sons, who was very
grounded, and he said,

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.530 align:middle line:10%
mom, I just put it there.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.653 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I saw you do it.

00:36:09.653 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, just come back in
the kitchen and we'll talk

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and we'll ask for it to
come back if it's in 5D.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And he finished his explanation,
came back to his book bag--

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.500 align:middle line:84%
right on top, as if he had not
pulled everything out and put

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.300 align:middle line:90%
it back.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.635 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it always
there, he just didn't see it?

00:36:26.635 --> 00:36:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: I was
watching him, too.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.498 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:36:29.498 --> 00:36:30.540 align:middle line:90%
You pull everything out--

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It just materializes.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well, it's
not that it's materializing.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:38.490 align:middle line:84%
We are vibing into
the ability to see it.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But was
it always there,

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:40.870 align:middle line:90%
you just couldn't see it?

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:41.703 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yeah.

00:36:41.703 --> 00:36:43.567 align:middle line:84%
It was always there and
you couldn't see it.

00:36:43.567 --> 00:36:45.900 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't see it because
you weren't at the vibration

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.070 align:middle line:90%
that this is visible to you.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.737 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If somebody
else had walked in,

00:36:48.737 --> 00:36:52.312 align:middle line:84%
in a different vibration,
would they have seen it?

00:36:52.312 --> 00:36:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: If they
were in fifth dimension,

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.152 align:middle line:90%
they might have seen it, yeah.

00:36:56.152 --> 00:36:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Because he was in 5D
when he put it down.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.485 align:middle line:84%
He was happy and
telling a great story.

00:36:59.485 --> 00:37:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:10%
When I asked my guides what was
going on, I was told, for me

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.140 align:middle line:10%
and for him, two
different times,

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:15.300 align:middle line:10%
the thing that's happening
is when you are in 3D,

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:10%
you can't see in 5D.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like Russian dolls.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So when you're 5D, you can
participate in 5, 4, 3, 2,

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.640 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.920 align:middle line:84%
When you are 3D, you can
participate in third, second,

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and first, but you can't
participate in five

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.320 align:middle line:84%
until you slide up there,
till you vibrationally

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.490 align:middle line:90%
move to that place.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And because the
vibration is so similar,

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:84%
you don't always notice that
you're there except for when

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.030 align:middle line:90%
you slide out.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how often
do people slide out?

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.565 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Every day,
on and off, all day long.

00:37:46.565 --> 00:37:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
not a good thing.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Well,
it's how we get there.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.690 align:middle line:10%
My mother told me when I
was calling her one time, so

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:10%
excited to tell her about this
really amazing thing, that one

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:03.285 align:middle line:10%
of my sons who was the
family troublemaker had done.

00:38:03.285 --> 00:38:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
honey, kids don't grow up

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:90%
in a straight line.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.450 align:middle line:90%
And I was horrified.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I said, what does mean?

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:09.330 align:middle line:90%
And she said--

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unacceptable
to you, right?

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.753 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: What
she meant was that--

00:38:13.753 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:84%
when I said to her,
what does that mean?

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.270 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, after they
do something really mature,

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:84%
they usually follow it
with something stupid.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he did.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And
he did, and we do.

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.370 align:middle line:90%
That's all of us.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.765 align:middle line:84%
We make a level of mastery,
and then we get scared.

00:38:28.765 --> 00:38:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Did I really do that?

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Did that really happen?

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:32.380 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.220 align:middle line:90%
That's not real.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.380 align:middle line:90%
And then we slide back.

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.005 align:middle line:84%
And then we slide
back up again, and we

00:38:36.005 --> 00:38:37.950 align:middle line:90%
do some other amazing things.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dramatic.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Well, I look at it

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.490 align:middle line:84%
as this is how the
world vibrates.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:46.740 align:middle line:90%
Machinery is on and off.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Mechanics on the computer
are zeros and ones.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:56.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're all
evolving into this place.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, the goal would be to
be vibrating so subtly,

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.040 align:middle line:84%
so smoothly, that
you don't notice

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.520 align:middle line:90%
that you're not exactly static.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.540 align:middle line:84%
See, if you were static, if
you didn't vibrate up and down

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.990 align:middle line:84%
or in and out, there
would be no growth.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you're
in the fifth dimension,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.880 align:middle line:84%
are things going
splendidly for you?

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: Yes.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.660 align:middle line:84%
But this is a very
interesting thing.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I was getting off of a
plane in my home city,

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.210 align:middle line:84%
which was a small
town in Wisconsin.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And because I knew the
clerk that takes my tickets,

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:33.337 align:middle line:90%
now she's handling baggage.

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:34.420 align:middle line:90%
And she said, hi, Maureen.

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.220 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm doing great.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.698 align:middle line:10%
But this is my day from blank--

00:39:39.698 --> 00:39:40.990 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to say the word--

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.448 align:middle line:10%
because I have to turn around
and be back here in two hours

00:39:43.448 --> 00:39:46.760 align:middle line:10%
because I'm going to the
East Coast for a workshop

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.140 align:middle line:10%
at the other end of the country.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at
me kind of funny

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.750 align:middle line:84%
because it was a very
unusual thing to say.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:56.220 align:middle line:10%
So then I stopped myself and
said, well, actually, I'm

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.850 align:middle line:10%
having a day of heaven on Earth
because I'm flying with United.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And I went home, and
there was two inches

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.900 align:middle line:90%
of water on my basement floor.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.660 align:middle line:84%
There was a pipe that
had broken in a hole.

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.078 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The worst feeling.

00:40:09.078 --> 00:40:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: My
neighbor came over.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.430 align:middle line:90%
I called him up.

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:12.270 align:middle line:90%
He came over.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:90%
We turned the water valve off.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:14.940 align:middle line:90%
We called the plumber.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.670 align:middle line:84%
He came when he said he would,
which was only one hour.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:21.735 align:middle line:84%
I called the airline and said,
can I get on a later flight?

00:40:21.735 --> 00:40:22.773 align:middle line:90%
We don't think so.

00:40:22.773 --> 00:40:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, they did put
me on a later flight.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
charge me a change fee

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:31.300 align:middle line:84%
because they felt sorry for
me, and that's unheard of.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.420 align:middle line:90%
And I went to the bank.

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:90%
I did my deposit.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.670 align:middle line:90%
My neighbor watched the plumber.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:37.270 align:middle line:90%
I did everything I needed to do.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I came back.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.570 align:middle line:90%
The land line phone was ringing.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.070 align:middle line:90%
That's how long ago it was.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was United,
and they said both

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.340 align:middle line:84%
of our feeder
flights into Chicago

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.290 align:middle line:90%
are running an hour late.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.570 align:middle line:84%
If you take the second
flight into Chicago

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.610 align:middle line:84%
that you're booked on, you're
going to miss your connections.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Is there any way you can go
on the earlier flight that's

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:90%
now leaving one hour later?

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.285 align:middle line:84%
And I said,
actually, yes, I can.

00:40:58.285 --> 00:40:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That
worked out for you.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And I sat on that
plane, and I looked around me,

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.760 align:middle line:90%
and I said, how did that happen?

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And my guide said, you asked
for a day of heaven on Earth.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you got it.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ST. GERMAIN: And you got it.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:16.567 align:middle line:84%
So then I thought, OK, well,
if I asked for a day of heaven

00:41:16.567 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, I'm going to
do that the next time

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.620 align:middle line:90%
I have a chockablock day.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.502 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I did
it the second time,

00:41:22.502 --> 00:41:24.460 align:middle line:84%
it occurred to me I could
ask for it every day.

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.767 align:middle line:90%
And I do, and so can you.

00:41:25.767 --> 00:41:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people get
a hold of you, Maureen?

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.808 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: They can
reach me at my website,

00:41:29.808 --> 00:41:33.560 align:middle line:10%
info@stgermainmysteryschool.com.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thanks.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It's very enlightening, talking
about the fifth dimension.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:41.460 align:middle line:10%
>>ST. GERMAIN: The fifth
dimension is a place

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:47.820 align:middle line:10%
that, when you are in
it, you don't notice

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:52.920 align:middle line:10%
except for that you feel
loving towards everyone,

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:10%
and everyone reacts
to the love in you.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So even when the bank
teller is having a bad day,

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:84%
when you walk up to the teller,
she suddenly puts on a smile

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and she's happy to see
you, and everything shifts.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:90%
That's how powerful it is.

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for being
on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ST. GERMAIN:
Thank you so much.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.218 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Well, the
next time you're

00:42:11.218 --> 00:42:12.990 align:middle line:10%
having problems in
the third dimension,

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:10%
get yourself into the fifth
dimension, and do it fast.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
