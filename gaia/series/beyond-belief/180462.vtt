We have a very special guest for

a clairvoyant healer and teacher
and owner of the Golden Rose

Metaphysical Q&A," which we'll

00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:10%
talk about in the program.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.555 align:middle line:10%
Lauren, welcome to the program.

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:44.349 align:middle line:10%
>>LAUREN CIELO: Oh, it's
good to be here, George.

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.667 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much.

to see you, my friend.

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:47.829 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How's life?

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: Getting
better all the time.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Excellent, excellent.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
You've been a psychic
healer, clairvoyant healer

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:90%
for how long?

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.080 align:middle line:90%
When did this start for you?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: About a
dozen years ago.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I was an engineer, and
rather bored with that.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to some
crazy psychic institute.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:90%
I spent two years studying.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:90%
And then I started Golden Rose.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you did, it
exploded for you, didn't it?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:90%
It took off.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.698 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: It really did.

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:90%
I seem to have a knack for this.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, I remember
when you were first on with me.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.909 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
talk a little bit

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
about that metamorphosis
you've gone through

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:90%
with "Beyond Belief."

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.990 align:middle line:84%
It is still one of the most
viewed shows we've ever done.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
People are into
this, aren't they?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I'm so grateful I
hope that something I say

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:90%
can help people.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.060 align:middle line:84%
When you were on with
me five years ago,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Lauren Cielo was a her.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Today you're a he.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I am.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You went
through a metamorphosis.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I did.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I started a transition at about
52 if you can believe that.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm 56 now.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.265 align:middle line:84%
So I'm starting to feel
more and more relaxed.

00:01:53.265 --> 00:01:54.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I seem to see the world
from a different perspective

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just happier.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I only bring
it up because people

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.420 align:middle line:84%
who have watched this
highly-rated, number-one show

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
are probably wondering,
that's the same person?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:90%
So let's get it out there.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.602 align:middle line:84%
And you freely talk
about this situation.

00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: You know, I had
to, because a lot of my work

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:90%
is on the phone.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's my voice.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:90%
So my voice was very, very high.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's not really
that low now.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to
make sure that people

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:90%
knew who they were talking to.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't really
stay in the closet.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.659 align:middle line:84%
I had to kind of tell
everybody that I'm transgender.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm
glad you're happy.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad things are
going well for you.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking forward to
this discussion with you

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
today because this is a
fascinating subject for me,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't think you were
podcasting five years ago,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.450 align:middle line:90%
were you?

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: No.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did that start?

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, Golden Rose is
a platform where I do readings.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And I teach other
people to read.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And I teach other people
how to teach this technique.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a
very limited percent

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.220 align:middle line:90%
of the population that benefits.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So I've collaborated
with Crystal Heinemann,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:90%
a great psychic.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of
taking metaphysics

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
to the masses with this
metaphysical Q&A podcast.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.297 align:middle line:84%
So it really starts
with soul contracts,

00:03:09.297 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
where we kind of left off
with that last time we talked.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know, we
highlight podcasting on "Coast

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:90%
to Coast" every month.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
We give people who
have an opportunity

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:84%
to share what they
do with the world.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's make sure we get you
on "Coast to Coast" as well

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and talk about your podcast
because you will get a bigger

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.665 align:middle line:90%
audience after that, too.

00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Tell me exactly what is
a clairvoyant healer.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, it's
really interesting.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
It really goes back
to quantum physics.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:10%
There's an experiment called
the "double-slit experiment,"

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:10%
where scientists push particles
through two slits in a piece

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:10%
of metal.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:10%
And what they realized is when
they were watching the quantum

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:10%
particles, they changed.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:84%
They behaved differently than
when no one was watching.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I
clairvoyantly look at you.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
you'll change, just

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.624 align:middle line:90%
like quantum particles would.

00:04:05.624 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:90%
So that's the healing.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It reacts to that.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Just being seen.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.057 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How would that work?

00:04:12.057 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Why would that work?

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: You're going to have
to ask the quantum physicists.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Dr. Emoto,
God rest his soul,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:10%
would look at
water ice crystals.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:10%
And he would play music
before he froze the ice,

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:10%
and then looked at it
under a microscope.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.370 align:middle line:10%
He would play what
we would consider

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:10%
nice music and fun music.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And then he would play
heavy metal music.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:84%
All the time that he looked
at the ice crystals of water

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:84%
after he played
the pleasant music,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:84%
it was just beautifully laid
out-- the crystals were.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
When he looked at it under
the heavy rock music,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:84%
it would be distorted
and out of the way.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's got to be
something to this.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I also use a healing
master, which

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned the last time
I was here, Ankaijia.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:90%
He's one of my best friends.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm reading
someone, and we kind of

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
see what the block is, he's the
one that goes over and really

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:90%
tries to move their energy.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.750 align:middle line:84%
If I try to do it,
Lauren only runs Lauren.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:90%
And George only runs George.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So if we energetically
mingle too much,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:90%
it won't be beneficial.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But again, that's the human
condition-- is to mingle.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:90%
But when I read, I don't.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I stay on my side.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And Ankaijia is the one
that goes over and heals.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you always
been psychically inclined?

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely not.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:90%
It's developed later in life?

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I was formally
trained to take an engineer

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and show them step by
step by step how to read.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I learned.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
learned it well.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I hope so.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it trial
and error for you?

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: No.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Once I realized what it was that
I was doing, it was very easy.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When clients come to
you, Lauren, what do they want?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Happiness.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jobs, security,
things like that?

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.972 align:middle line:90%
Or relationships?

00:06:06.972 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think just
being happy-- just trying

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.236 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to be
happy in the chaotic world

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:90%
that we're living in.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.364 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they miserable
when they come in to you?

00:06:14.364 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, sometimes
I feel like a dentist

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.010 align:middle line:90%
or a traffic cop, right?

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
When I first start talking to
somebody, I say, how are you?

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:84%
They're never
really well, or know

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't be calling me.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think by the time
we're done, though, we've

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.400 align:middle line:84%
kind of shifted their
intention and their awareness

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think by the
end of readings,

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I do think they've been able to
find what they're looking for,

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:90%
I hope.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it that awareness
and that shift that helps

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.177 align:middle line:90%
change them?

00:06:42.177 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I think so.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I think one thing
if we realize that--

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
it's really our
higher self that's

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:90%
creating all of those contracts.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And after my show here last
time, a lot of my new clients

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.060 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know, well,
how can I here on Earth

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.100 align:middle line:90%
change my soul contracts?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.489 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:06:59.489 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want you to
tell me a little bit

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:90%
before we look at the clip.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:84%
You did a reading
with a television host

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:90%
named Taylor Baldwin.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about Taylor.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, Taylor was great.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:90%
She invited me on.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
She was very interested
in the subject.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not often that
an interviewer will

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.745 align:middle line:90%
let me read them on the air.

00:07:16.745 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So I thought she was very
brave, because she didn't

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:90%
know what I was going to say.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll let you do that to
me here, too, if you want.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Excellent.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But let's take
a look at Taylor Baldwin.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: OK.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:10%
Just say your full
name three times.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:10%
>>TAYLOR BALDWIN:
Taylor Baldwin.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.710 align:middle line:10%
Taylor Baldwin.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:10%
Taylor Baldwin.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:10%
This is what you
showed me when I

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:10%
said you came colliding
into my space earlier today.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.550 align:middle line:10%
So one thing you want
people to know about you,

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:10%
Taylor, is that
you're really smart.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:10%
That's the first thing
you want people to know.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:10%
And really, the
wealth of information

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:10%
you have goes really deep.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:10%
You mentioned it
before as we were

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:10%
talking that you've had a
very unusual life, or maybe

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:10%
a challenging life.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.249 align:middle line:10%
And that's what's brought you
this wealth of information.

00:07:58.249 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:10%
But there's way more
to it than that.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.164 align:middle line:10%
You're actually
running the color

00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:10%
that you're wearing, which
people do all the time.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.824 align:middle line:10%
So most of you is yellow.

00:08:04.824 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:10%
But right around
the edges, you're

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:10%
showing that color orange.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:10%
And really, what this is--

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:10%
I believe that you're
showing that you're

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.980 align:middle line:10%
going to make a shift.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:10%
In your career, you're about
to make another step forward

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.170 align:middle line:10%
or step to the other side.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:10%
So you're kind of brewing
in that energy right now.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:10%
But there's a lot more
information inside of you

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:10%
that you've yet to really--

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:10%
I almost want to say, take out
of a compartment and looked at,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:10%
is the way you say it.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:10%
I always like the way
clients say the words.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:10%
I just kind of hold space
while they fill it in.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
say, you point to an age

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
where you're really going
to master all of it.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
external information.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:10%
It's not like it's people
around you or education.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:10%
It's all inside you.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's been inside you.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:10%
It happens at 52 is
what you're saying.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:10%
So at 52, that's when you
really kind of come into your--

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:10%
you say "wisdom,"
which I like that word.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And also, you tend
to balance out at 52.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.030 align:middle line:84%
You're really focused on
that age for some reason.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:10%
I think it has something
to do with your family.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:10%
When I look, it's like there's
a nice, broad foundation

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.215 align:middle line:10%
for you and your girls.

00:09:17.215 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:10%
And we were talking about them
earlier before we started.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:10%
So it could be that there's
a lot of shifts in the family

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:10%
unit at 52 for you.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:10%
And you're kind of the
matriarch, where you're setting

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.920 align:middle line:10%
out the foundation for this.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:10%
And that's when you really get--

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.270 align:middle line:10%
I think by mothering and
grandmothering that--

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.070 align:middle line:10%
>>BALDWIN: Whoa!

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: I know.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:10%
I knew you were going to
light up on that picture.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.580 align:middle line:10%
But I think through
that space is

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:10%
where you really find the wisdom
that you've been nibbling at.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:10%
But you haven't really
noticed or owned

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:10%
all of the internal wisdom
that you really have.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:10%
So you're very, very,
adamant about age 52.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.904 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She looks
like you were spot on.

00:09:59.904 --> 00:10:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I don't know.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:90%
I hope it helped her.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
city was that in?

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: San Diego.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: San Diego.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, down that way.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're doing that,
what is coming into your mind

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.835 align:middle line:90%
to do that the way you did?

00:10:11.835 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Oh, I
love that question

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:84%
because I think a lot
of times clairvoyance

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:84%
may not tell you what
we really experience.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So what I see are
images and color.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
It's really the only two
things in the universe.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And from just one little
flash of an image,

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:84%
the information just
starts flowing in.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:90%
I kind of step to the side.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And it is weird because I'll use
vocabulary words that I don't

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:90%
really have in my vocabulary.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't really even
know what they mean.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
they come from?

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I think I read
mostly from my crown chakra.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:90%
I know things.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
resource you tap into, too?

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: No.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.396 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe I channel.

00:10:49.396 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe I do.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't have a
guide or anything like that?

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, Ankaijia, but
he doesn't plug all the way

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:84%
into my crown, which we would
consider being a channel.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.187 align:middle line:90%
So it's really me.

00:11:00.187 --> 00:11:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's do me.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: All right.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Hang on.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me what to do.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: OK.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.214 align:middle line:84%
Just say your name
three times, please.

00:11:06.214 --> 00:11:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: George Noory.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.620 align:middle line:90%
George Noory.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:90%
George Noory.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: OK.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.891 align:middle line:90%
So George, you're running pink.

00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's really
three, I would say,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:90%
peaks of the pink energy.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I see shades--
well, let me say it this way.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Energies that my six chakras
see is shades of pink.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Whatever those
energies really are,

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
you'll use them to
increase your self-love.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So there's three ways that
you're doing that right now.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
One you haven't
even noticed yet.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.379 align:middle line:90%
One is this.

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
thing that's happening.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:90%
There's something new coming in.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little bit
off to the side of this,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:84%
although it kind of has the
same flavor in your career.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And let me say hello to this
one that you don't know yet.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:84%
This seems to have to
do with relationships.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really mean
intimate relationships.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And it does feel like
family energy to me.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure that this is
really people in your family.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you get there
until a little bit later

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:90%
in life, though.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So I guess what I would say
is what you're doing now

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:84%
is one of those peaks that
helps you love yourself more.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Something else is
coming off to the side

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that's very close to this new
opportunities in your career.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But then this other
one-- you're saving it

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:84%
for when you're a little
bit more seasoned.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Hang on.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:90%
It goes back to the way--

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
not that you were
treated as a child,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:84%
but maybe the way that you
learned to interact in groups.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So as you get older,
there's going to be--

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:90%
and it's not just one person.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:90%
I see several people.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I almost think, my friend--
this is what I think.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I think you kind
of do what I do.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I think you kind of hold
space while other people heal.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if you're
really looking at that yet.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.340 align:middle line:84%
You are more focused on the new
career things that are coming.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:90%
But watch.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And I get this is really
in your 70s, George,

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
when I look at when you're
really going to step into this.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At least I'll be
around in my 70s, right?

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: You'll be the
focal point of some group,

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.625 align:middle line:90%
but you're the teacher.

00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
You're the teacher
in that group.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Does the fact that I'm a Gemini
have anything to do with it,

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Lauren?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I don't think so.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.014 align:middle line:84%
I think that manifests in
your space in different ways.

00:13:19.014 --> 00:13:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that
manifests the way you

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:84%
look at this world
and the other world.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.612 align:middle line:90%
And maybe when you get 70--

00:13:24.612 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm not saying you
have to wait till you're 70.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's what
you're looking to do--

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:84%
is put those two
things together.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
this for clients,

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I assume it's a little
more elaborate, right?

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Just on somebody's
name, I can probably

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:84%
talk for about 10 or
15 minutes without them

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:90%
asking any questions.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.066 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But when they
start asking questions,

00:13:47.066 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
what are they
generally looking for?

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, usually
the first thing

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:84%
they say is, well,
you've just answered

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:90%
all the questions I came with.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So I have a new
set of questions.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:90%
But it's everything.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.820 align:middle line:90%
It's feeling stuck.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that's kind
of a main theme.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:84%
We can't really see
ourselves progressing,

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, on the Earth
plane as much as we really are.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You ever have
anybody break down

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:90%
and cry in front of you?

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, always.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It gets
emotional, doesn't it?

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.865 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, it does.

00:14:11.865 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Because who I'm
really talking to is

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.450 align:middle line:84%
your higher self, the part
of you that lives forever.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And that part of
us sees our life

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.020 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth so much
different than we do.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.270 align:middle line:84%
We really have a
lot of self-hatred.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does a person
take away from a reading?

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:90%
What do they get?

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think a bigger
perspective of maybe

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
what they're living
through, I think.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I think people
get tunnel vision.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.330 align:middle line:90%
They're focused on one thing.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a good example.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'll think
to heal something,

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
you logically think you
ought to do something.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.380 align:middle line:90%
That seems logical.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But when I read, a lot of
times it's not logical.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.889 align:middle line:84%
To heal a sore toe, you don't
necessarily soak it in water.

00:14:59.889 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:84%
It might be something
completely different.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:84%
That's fascinating
what happens, isn't it?

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.564 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: It is fascinating.

00:15:05.564 --> 00:15:06.365 align:middle line:90%
I love my job.

00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:08.322 align:middle line:84%
It's so much more
interesting than engineering.

00:15:08.322 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's different
every day, isn't it?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.310 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And I'd
probably say this.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.822 align:middle line:84%
I do maybe two or three
readings a day when I'm working.

00:15:15.822 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's
pretty intense.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: It is.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm very grateful.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
But I'll find myself
saying at least once a day,

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen that before.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's so stimulating.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Edgar Cayce when he
did his readings, Lauren, was

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:10%
eventually exhausted.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:84%
It may have ended up
killing him because

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:90%
of the readings and everything.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever feel that
way at the end of a day--

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
that it was just so exhausting
giving and giving and telling

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:90%
people about themselves?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, does it ever drain you?

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, first I want to thank
Cayce because without him, I

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have a job.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that coined
the phrase "life reading."

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.404 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:15:57.404 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: But he did it
a little bit different.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:90%
He was the sleeping prophet.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.194 align:middle line:84%
So he would actually
leave his body.

00:16:03.194 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're awake.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I'm awake.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's me.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:06.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm the one doing it.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.720 align:middle line:84%
He would allow another
being to come in.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's where the
energetic mingling happens.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And it can be really
non-beneficial.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So for a channeler to really
stay on the forefront,

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:84%
on the forward lean, they really
need to energetically separate

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
from whoever they're letting
step into their space

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:90%
because it will cause disease.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It will.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.244 align:middle line:84%
So you've been able to battle
that and fight that off?

00:16:32.244 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I feel great.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.460 align:middle line:90%
I feel better after I read.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You get energetic?

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.351 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh my gosh, yes.

00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel that the
people that I'm reading--

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:84%
their higher selves
are super genius.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.210 align:middle line:84%
When they're trying to
figure something out

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and I can understand how they're
doing that, after I'm done,

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.381 align:middle line:84%
I go look in the mirror
and go, how can I do that?

00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
been into a reading

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:84%
where you realize this
is not a good person?

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, yes.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe like
a serial killer

00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:90%
came to you, for an example.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.470 align:middle line:84%
What I really notice is
emotional and mental disease.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:84%
There's one certain
way that I can tell

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:90%
right away if this person is--

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of times,
what people might

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:84%
feel motivated to do
is to step to the side

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:84%
of emotional and
mental health and go

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:19.693 align:middle line:90%
right towards spirituality.

00:17:19.693 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's really a pyramid.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to be physically
healthy, emotionally healthy,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:90%
mentally.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you can work
on the spiritual.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really looking for
maybe people who hear voices.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And the voices are telling
them to do bad things.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's mental illness.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're hearing voices,
and they're telling you,

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.360 align:middle line:90%
you're wonderful.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Get out there and
grab your life,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.697 align:middle line:84%
that's really your
higher self talking.

00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had a point where
you wanted to refer somebody

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:90%
to a psychiatrist?

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Not really.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Going back to contracts, when
somebody signs a contract

00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:84%
to work with me, they
are high vibrating.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And they really can
understand what I'm saying

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:90%
and where I'm coming from.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So I don't get a lot of
those kind of clients.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about the soul.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Where does that fit
into what you do?

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: The soul
is the higher self.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I use those words
interchangeably.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So our soul lives forever
on the astral plane.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.085 align:middle line:84%
And every once in a while,
it will decide to incarnate.

00:18:20.085 --> 00:18:23.190 align:middle line:84%
It could incarnate in this
reality or many others.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
It can incarnate more
than once at a time.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.514 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
a soul contract?

00:18:28.514 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, soul
contracts are really

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
what create all the adventures
that we live through.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to call them
"lessons" or "experiences."

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:90%
I like "adventures."

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we experience
is in agreement with our higher

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
free will lives.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.810 align:middle line:84%
When you hear the
concept of free will,

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Lauren Cielo here on
Earth doesn't really

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:90%
feel that I have free will.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But my higher self does
to sign those contracts,

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
revise them, or cancel
them altogether.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So we can do that.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Our higher self can.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:84%
You might think of it as the
higher self is the puppet

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:90%
master, and we're the puppet.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So the puppet can't really
influence the puppet master

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:09.450 align:middle line:90%
too much.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.325 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:19:10.325 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Give me an example
of a soul contract.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:90%
What would the deal be?

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: This one that
you and I have, right?

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:84%
We started it five years ago,
and we're continuing it now.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
things-- when

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I was getting ready to
come on your show again,

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is in
retrograde right now.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the aspects of
that is conversations that

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.709 align:middle line:90%
started earlier get finished.

00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of think that's
what we're doing today.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.295 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you had a good
time on our first program,

00:19:35.295 --> 00:19:35.530 align:middle line:90%
didn't you?

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh my gosh.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I had a great time.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the response
was good for you?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:90%
This one will be, too.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I hope.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had Dr. Bruce
Goldberg on, a hypnotherapist.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said years later, he's
still getting phone calls

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
from the first "Beyond
Belief" show we did with him.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's got amazing
staying power.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I do, too.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gaia has got some
great programs on this network.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: They absolutely do.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful benefit
to everyone-- the healers

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.127 align:middle line:84%
and the people looking
for the healing.

00:20:03.127 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about karma
for a second, Lauren.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:90%
What goes around comes around.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: No.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.035 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:11.035 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You mean we
can do anything we

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.490 align:middle line:90%
want without any repercussions?

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yep, if that's
what those contracts say.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.020 align:middle line:84%
I always thought that if you
were good, it came back to you.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:84%
If you were bad, it
came back to you.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, think
of it this way.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
The higher selves who are
signing those contracts--

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:90%
they're neutral.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't know good from bad.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
adds that flavor

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
is the society that
you're in when you're

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:84%
having those
adventures, when you're

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:90%
living through those contracts.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So karma is really unfinished
contracts from other lives.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So when you get
ready to incarnate,

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:84%
you're likely to go back to
those unfulfilled contracts

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.956 align:middle line:84%
and hook up with
those people again.

00:20:52.956 --> 00:20:54.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
that old saying,

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:84%
karma is a-- but we won't
say what that other word is.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I would say
to be spiritually healthy,

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.470 align:middle line:84%
you really don't want
to have to do anything.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self wants the
ability to change on a dime.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So if it has a lot of
karma, it is more difficult.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a
spiritual teacher

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.850 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Matt Kahn who
talks about soul contracts.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MATT KAHN: Let's talk about
soul contracts for a moment.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
A soul contract usually has
a few different premises.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:84%
A contract is either
motivating you

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
into an action step that is
the embodiment of your highest

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.910 align:middle line:90%
wisdom.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So things will happen to
you, like target practice

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.880 align:middle line:84%
or like flashcards, to
put you in a situation

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:84%
to see if you're willing to
let your highest wisdom be

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:84%
the resolution to the
circumstance at hand.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:10%
So a soul contract
is either motivating

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:01.250 align:middle line:10%
you to cultivate the choices
you haven't made in the past

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:10%
to hone your highest
vibration and bring

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:10%
your full potential into form.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Or you're put in situations
that seem unfair,

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:84%
unjust just to become aware
of the judgments you have.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And by learning to embrace
and love the one who judges,

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:90%
that level of judgment unravels.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:10%
And you exit that moment more
evolved than the moment before.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:10%
Does that make sense?

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So we're either being
motivated to act

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.430 align:middle line:84%
on our highest consciousness
as the solution

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:90%
to the circumstance.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:10%
Or we're put in situations
just to come more

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:10%
into harmony with the
circumstances and feelings

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:54.030 align:middle line:10%
that we keep judging as if
it's not divinely orchestrated.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what's
he saying, Lauren?

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I agree with
most of what he's saying.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting ways
that contracts might play out

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:05.525 align:middle line:84%
is you actually trick yourself
into getting a healing.

00:23:05.525 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
a good example.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:84%
When I was an engineer,
I was the only woman.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:13.359 align:middle line:84%
And the guys I worked with
were telling blonde jokes.

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In front of you.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And I found it
very offensive because they

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:90%
were dumb women jokes.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I would get all
upset on the inside.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And now looking back, I
realized that my higher self

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
was trying to light
up my, I would say,

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.100 align:middle line:90%
hatred of being a woman.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:90%
So it all came out, right?

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I worked
through that energy,

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I stopped focusing on how
those type of comments

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.057 align:middle line:90%
were affecting me.

00:23:43.057 --> 00:23:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
see that it was more

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:90%
about that other person.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So if I said it another
way, my higher self

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:84%
was signing contracts
so that the parts of me

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:84%
that were afraid of being
a woman would get lit up.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And once I dealt with all of
that, two things happened.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.990 align:middle line:84%
One, nobody says
those kind of things

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:90%
about women in front of me.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And if they do, I
don't go, oh my gosh.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm so uncomfortable.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.090 align:middle line:90%
I think, oh my gosh, my friend.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:90%
You have a problem with women.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:90%
So it changed--

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You reverse it.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I was able to
release what it was.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.229 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only
reason that my higher self

00:24:20.229 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:90%
would have put me through that.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.103 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Plus they're
not funny jokes.

00:24:23.103 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: They're not funny.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They really aren't.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.530 align:middle line:90%
In the old days, Lauren--

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and I've watched a lot of Frank
Sinatra clips and Sammy Davis

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Jr. clips and stuff.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they got
away with some of the things

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:90%
they said.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.317 align:middle line:90%
But you can't do that today.

00:24:39.317 --> 00:24:40.116 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:24:40.116 --> 00:24:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Things are really changing.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And they're integrating,
just like myself.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm integrating male and female.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of hard
to not like either one.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, back to these soul
contracts for a moment.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.930 align:middle line:84%
For an individual who doesn't
have the ability, let's say,

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:59.330 align:middle line:84%
to see a Lauren Cielo, how
do they do this themselves?

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
What can they do
within themself to try

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:03.100 align:middle line:90%
to make them a better person?

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.891 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I think
one thing you can do

00:25:04.891 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:84%
is set your intention
that all of your contracts

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.010 align:middle line:90%
are up to date.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.830 align:middle line:84%
If you've signed some
contract before you were born,

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and it's not really
beneficial anymore--

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:90%
and that's really easy.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:84%
You can just ask your
guides and angels

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.223 align:middle line:84%
to go work with your higher
self and to bring them

00:25:20.223 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:90%
into present time.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:84%
You can't really
change them, though.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your higher self
wants to experience, it will.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
I'm interested in now

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:84%
with the new platform
that I'm working with.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:84%
How do you live through
those soul contracts?

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.170 align:middle line:84%
The contracts are written
by your higher self,

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:90%
and you can't change that.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:84%
But how can you live
through them here on Earth?

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it kind
of like making a deal

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:90%
with the good or the bad?

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Once you've etched
it, that's it?

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Faustus gave his
soul to the devil

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.930 align:middle line:84%
because he wanted to
have an incredible life.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.460 align:middle line:84%
When he came down
to the point where

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:84%
he had to give his soul
up, he didn't want to.

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I don't really
see good and bad.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.180 align:middle line:84%
When I read, I
would never say, oh,

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:84%
you have a bunch of negative
energy in your space.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:90%
I only see two types of energy--

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:90%
your energy and someone else's.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And can you tell when you meet
somebody for the first time

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:84%
whether they have the
soul energy or not?

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I think everyone does.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Some might not know they do.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
situation I was in.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I was very much blinded
to who I really was.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think that right
now, it's really easy

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.017 align:middle line:84%
to kind of crack your own
shell and step out and find out

00:26:37.017 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:84%
who you really are just because
there's so many energies

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:90%
on the planet now.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But once you tap into it,
there are incredible things

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.567 align:middle line:90%
you can do.

00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Well, just think of me.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I call my life a
"white cane life."

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:52.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm blind.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.024 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where I'm going.

00:26:54.024 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:84%
If I would have been
six years old and say,

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a
transgender psychic,

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
what that was.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So I think for a lot
of us, the paradigms

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
have shifted so much that to
set goals might be futile.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Because your higher
self is probably

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:84%
going to have goals that you
would never even believe,

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.060 align:middle line:84%
especially as we move further
into the new energies on Earth.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you consider
yourself psychic, too?

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, yes.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:90%
This ability to be psychic--

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:84%
has it gotten you out
of sticky situations?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: It's probably got
me into more situations that

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.446 align:middle line:84%
were sticky than out
of them, I would say.

00:27:30.446 --> 00:27:32.779 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It got you in more
trouble than you would have.

00:27:32.779 --> 00:27:35.082 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And it's very
difficult for me to read myself.

00:27:35.082 --> 00:27:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you need
somebody else to read you?

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that probably a
standard case of most psychics?

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think so, because
it's all about neutrality.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.687 align:middle line:84%
If somebody comes and tells me
they've committed crimes or--

00:27:48.687 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And will they
freely tell you that?

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, yes.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:52.548 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a priest.

00:27:52.548 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.882 align:middle line:90%
I don't judge.

00:27:54.882 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:90%
I just look at the contracts.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:01.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the archetypal contract
is the Jesus-Judas contract.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:84%
If you want a
lifetime as a Jesus,

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:90%
you have to have a Judas.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So on the astral plane, the
souls of Jesus and Judas

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.720 align:middle line:84%
love each other the most
to come down on Earth

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and to play out that
drama where Judas

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:90%
is going to be hated forever.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some say that
Jesus basically told

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.477 align:middle line:84%
Judas and instructed
Judas, you need to do this.

00:28:21.477 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the only
way the plan works.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: It's the only way.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Possible?

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think the people
that sign the toughest contracts

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:90%
with you--

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.080 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are going to
hurt you and them the most--

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.400 align:middle line:84%
are the people that
love you the most.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.483 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:28:35.483 --> 00:28:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that Jesus kind of
gave him a pass after he died--

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that Judas wasn't going to be in
hell for the rest of his life?

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.875 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I
don't really see

00:28:43.875 --> 00:28:45.230 align:middle line:90%
that there is a heaven or hell.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:84%
What I see is different
levels of the astral plane.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you're going
to sign a contract for someone

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:53.302 align:middle line:84%
to live out a
lifetime as a messiah,

00:28:53.302 --> 00:28:54.760 align:middle line:84%
by the time you're
out of body, you

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.260 align:middle line:84%
do vibrate pretty
high-- that you

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
would be willing to do
that for someone else.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say, Lauren,

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:84%
for you has been the most
enlightening aspect of what

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:90%
you do?

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I would say letting
go of victimhood and guilt.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Because once we
understand that everything

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is based on those
contracts, then

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.030 align:middle line:90%
you can't be a perpetrator.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can't be a
victim because everyone

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:84%
was in agreement to
have that event happen.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still trying to
live into that, too--

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.091 align:middle line:84%
releasing the things
that people have

00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:84%
done to me that I
didn't particularly like

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and the things I've done to
people that weren't nice.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:90%
They're there.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.130 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: You bet.

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think
people have guilt?

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, yes.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think guilt could be
constructive in some ways,

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:84%
because you feel bad
because you think

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:43.960 align:middle line:90%
you've done something wrong.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:90%
And you want to make a change.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Shame, on the other
hand, is you feel bad

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.210 align:middle line:90%
because of who you are.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I deal with
a lot-- is shame of who I am

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and all the shifts
that I've gone through

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.102 align:middle line:84%
and how it's affected
the people around me.

00:29:58.102 --> 00:29:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me
about your podcast

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:90%
and what you're doing with that.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, excellent.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
The podcast is called
"Metaphysical Q&A."

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And like I had mentioned,
it starts right

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:90%
where soul contracts leaves off.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So if here on Earth we might
entertain the idea that there's

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:18.160 align:middle line:84%
this mystical higher self that's
creating all the adventures

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.890 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, then,
again, how do we

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:90%
live through those gracefully--

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.410 align:middle line:84%
the things that might seem
that we could never do,

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.690 align:middle line:84%
but our higher self
signed a contract for it?

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:32.920 align:middle line:84%
How can we release what's in
our space that makes it so hard?

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.560 align:middle line:84%
How can we come out of
resistance to our soul

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.770 align:middle line:84%
contracts is really what
"Metaphysical Q&A" is all

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:38.570 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.403 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you're
clamoring, of course,

00:30:40.403 --> 00:30:44.790 align:middle line:84%
to hear part of the podcast,
we've got a clip for you.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.720 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: I'll tell you in
a nutshell the difference,

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.950 align:middle line:10%
I think, between,
oh, I don't know,

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:10%
maybe counseling
versus metaphysics.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:10%
When I say this example,
everyone listening

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:10%
will know exactly what I mean
about what metaphysics are.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:09.210 align:middle line:10%
So I remember a time when
I was really distraught,

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:10%
looking for a healing,
looking for a healer.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.190 align:middle line:10%
And I would go to a
psychic or whoever.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:20.280 align:middle line:10%
And I would tell them
what my issues were,

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.480 align:middle line:10%
where my difficulties were,
where my frustrations were,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.530 align:middle line:10%
where my pain was.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:10%
And more times than
not, I would get

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:10%
a response like, well, Lauren,
just let go and let God.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know
about you, Crystal.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.780 align:middle line:10%
But when I hear those types
of things when I'm upset,

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.510 align:middle line:10%
it made me even more upset.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.490 align:middle line:10%
I get so frustrated.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:52.390 align:middle line:10%
So in the teachings that
both Crystal and I do,

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:56.910 align:middle line:10%
we would never tell you
to let go and let God.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:10%
We would show you how to do it.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.650 align:middle line:10%
What we would teach you
is how to ground yourself

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:08.700 align:middle line:10%
into the earth so you
have a path to let go.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:10%
And then we would
have you plug in

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:10%
to the top of your crown
chakra a golden cord.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.670 align:middle line:10%
And on the other end
of that golden cord

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:20.880 align:middle line:10%
would be the highest
energy that you recognize.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:10%
You might call that
the supreme being.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:10%
So when that energy comes down
into your space, that's God.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.460 align:middle line:10%
So you're letting go
down the grounding cord.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.370 align:middle line:10%
And you're letting God in
through the cord that's

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.020 align:middle line:10%
in the top of your crown chakra.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:42.390 align:middle line:10%
So it's not just
some words that are

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.460 align:middle line:10%
supposed to give you comfort.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:10%
It's the step one,
step two, step three.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, in
a nutshell, that's

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.530 align:middle line:84%
also a video podcast that you're
doing, not just audio, right?

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.330 align:middle line:90%
We deliver it both ways.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do people find you?

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Basically through
our individual businesses,

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Golden Rose Psychic Services
and Crystal Sunshine Psychic

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Services.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they can
watch the program that way?

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.310 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: Well, they come in to
"Metaphysical Q&A" that way.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.380 align:middle line:10%
"Metaphysical Q&A"
is its own website.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:11.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.150 align:middle line:10%
And it's simple.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:13.855 align:middle line:10%
How often do you do
the podcast, Lauren?

00:33:13.855 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, it's
streaming live now.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.580 align:middle line:90%
The first season is done.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:90%
There's 15 episodes.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I think we're up to
episode four right now.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's intense.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:27.350 align:middle line:10%
Season two we start
shooting next month.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.520 align:middle line:10%
We bring in experts.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.370 align:middle line:10%
And in season three,
we take it on the road.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So crystal and I will
be traveling around.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me a little
bit more about Crystal.

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.881 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, Crystal
is a former student.

00:33:37.881 --> 00:33:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've never had
a student like her.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I teach a beginning clairvoyant
six-month program, an advanced

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.840 align:middle line:84%
five-month program, and then a
five-month teacher's program.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And Crystal took
all of them at once.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At once?

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: At once.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.660 align:middle line:84%
I have never had
a student do that.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I think about Crystal
is she comes from aviation.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.550 align:middle line:90%
She's a flight attendant.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And she's been all over
the world many times.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think by hurling her
body into different energies

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:10.172 align:middle line:84%
so quickly, she's just
able to release energy

00:34:10.172 --> 00:34:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't really hold onto
a lot of stuff that might make

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.992 align:middle line:90%
it difficult for other people.

00:34:13.992 --> 00:34:14.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, good.

00:34:14.825 --> 00:34:17.040 align:middle line:84%
What was the reason for
creating the podcast?

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:22.429 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, what I realized
was that what Crystal and I

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:26.300 align:middle line:84%
think is that we can explain
every human experience that

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.739 align:middle line:90%
you're having--

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:31.580 align:middle line:84%
an emotion, a thought,
a memory, anything--

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.289 align:middle line:90%
from metaphysics.

00:34:33.289 --> 00:34:36.830 align:middle line:84%
If we explain to you
exactly what you're made of

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and why you're thinking
and feeling the way

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.920 align:middle line:90%
you are, then you can change it.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of
the subjects you've touched?

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.931 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Everything.

00:34:45.931 --> 00:34:47.389 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Human
emotion, everything.

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Everything.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Physical-- how come our
bodies do certain things,

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.594 align:middle line:90%
like sympathetic yawning?

00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:56.895 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:34:56.895 --> 00:34:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It doesn't
mean I'm bored, right?

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: It has a
metaphysical reason.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.300 align:middle line:84%
If your eye twitches,
there's a reason for that.

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:10.700 align:middle line:84%
We go through ghosts and angels,
ascended masters in the 15

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.269 align:middle line:90%
episodes we've shot so far.

00:35:12.269 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And the questions come from the
audience, from our listeners.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So they've got some really
interesting questions

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:17.710 align:middle line:90%
they want answered.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:18.876 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, they always do.

00:35:18.876 --> 00:35:20.000 align:middle line:90%
It's surprising sometimes.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.666 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed,
Lauren, that sometimes

00:35:21.666 --> 00:35:25.407 align:middle line:84%
if someone yawns that if you're
close by, you may yawn, too?

00:35:25.407 --> 00:35:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost
like it's infectious.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.446 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:35:29.446 --> 00:35:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, you might have to
watch the podcast to find out.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'll throw you
a bone for you.

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Really what it is is it
has to do with survival.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Think of us as monkeys before we
were evolved into Homo sapiens.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And one of us was tired.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm going to fall
asleep in the cave,

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure everybody
else is falling asleep, too.

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So it really comes as
a survival mechanism.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
you're afraid we're

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:00.630 align:middle line:84%
going to kill you or
do something to you.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And so when I realized
that, I started kind of playing

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.390 align:middle line:90%
with it in my own space.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So I would imagine
a cat yawning.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't really
make me want to yawn.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought
about a lion yawning.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to yawn.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think it has to do with if
you think that that animal is

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.170 align:middle line:84%
capable of getting you
while you're asleep, then

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.560 align:middle line:84%
you'll start to work what we
would call "matching pictures."

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's both go to sleep and
not one of us eat each other.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.845 align:middle line:84%
So it really comes back--
it's a first chakra thing.

00:36:32.845 --> 00:36:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
it's truly bizarre.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.800 align:middle line:90%
And just notice this, folks.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.760 align:middle line:84%
If you see someone yawn,
you may yawn just like that.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.863 align:middle line:90%
It's a survival mechanism.

00:36:42.863 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's not
that you're tired.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.084 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:36:47.084 --> 00:36:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: We don't
sneeze that way.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.330 align:middle line:90%
We don't cough that way.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.530 align:middle line:84%
It's the fear of falling
asleep when it's not safe.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always
thought when I was a kid

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.050 align:middle line:84%
that when I saw that
happen, if somebody yawned,

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.520 align:middle line:84%
they sucked the air out
of the area you were in.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.040 align:middle line:90%
And you were just--

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:90%
and did the same thing.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, the subject
matter that you come up

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.610 align:middle line:90%
with-- how do you do that?

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, like I
mention in the podcast,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Crystal and I figure that
everybody is pretty curious.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So we started answering
their questions in easily

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.670 align:middle line:90%
understood metaphysical terms.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we realized that we
didn't just want to entertain.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:84%
We didn't want to just
stimulate people's crown chakras

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:28.710 align:middle line:84%
with information they
hadn't heard before.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So we started to add on to the
"Metaphysical Q&A" platform.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
teachings come in,

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:84%
where we show everybody that
the only thing that you're

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:84%
made of, from the outer
layer of your aura in,

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.300 align:middle line:90%
is just energy and information.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing
in the universe.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see
something or hear something,

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:54.170 align:middle line:84%
the way you react to it
is because of the energy

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.649 align:middle line:90%
and information in your space.

00:37:55.649 --> 00:37:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about a
relationship, Lauren,

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.925 align:middle line:90%
between human and animal?

00:37:58.925 --> 00:37:59.997 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything?

00:37:59.997 --> 00:38:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Same thing.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't really think
that the energetics

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.120 align:middle line:84%
of animals and humans
are different at all.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.290 align:middle line:90%
We are an animal.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a pet that you
love, there's a bond there,

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:17.030 align:middle line:90%
isn't there?

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.863 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:38:17.863 --> 00:38:19.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's contracts.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is life
a soul contract?

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's a group agreement,
a planetary contract.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why some things are
allowed and some things aren't.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I usually go back to
Einstein on this one.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:37.170 align:middle line:84%
E equals mc squared has
been in the Akashic records

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:37.970 align:middle line:90%
the whole time.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's always been there.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:39.875 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Always been there.

00:38:39.875 --> 00:38:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
everyone was incarnate,

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:45.620 align:middle line:84%
decided, OK, we'll let
E equals mc squared.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have nuclear
power and nuclear weapons.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a
sudden, Einstein said, E

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:53.310 align:middle line:90%
equals mc squared.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:54.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever have a day

00:38:54.685 --> 00:38:59.300 align:middle line:84%
as a clairvoyant where
it just is blocked,

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.660 align:middle line:90%
it just doesn't happen?

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: No.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've never
had one of those?

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: No.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.206 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:39:04.206 --> 00:39:05.787 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:39:05.787 --> 00:39:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing, I've
been doing it so long, George.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And I can turn it on and
turn it off like crazy.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't usually read people
at all in regular life,

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.364 align:middle line:90%
maybe if I'm in a jam.

00:39:17.364 --> 00:39:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To help you, right?

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah, right.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:22.350 align:middle line:90%
But I don't really.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
different space for me.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:25.996 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if
you go out to dinner

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:28.334 align:middle line:84%
with a group of people,
you're not analyzing everybody

00:39:28.334 --> 00:39:29.250 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I actually
have been invited

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.052 align:middle line:84%
to parties where afterwards
the host would say, well, what

00:39:33.052 --> 00:39:34.260 align:middle line:90%
did you read about everybody?

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
I wasn't reading.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And was that the
intent for inviting you?

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I think it was.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wanted
you to read everybody.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been to
a party as a party,

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:84%
where you're the person and
they want you to read people?

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes, I have.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.380 align:middle line:90%
I call them "group readings."

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And usually the groups are
people that work together.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And they want their
company to do better

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:02.120 align:middle line:84%
or teams that are competing
together, things like that--

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I guess a group
with a common goal.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have to read people?

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Or can you read events as well?

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Anything,
because everything's

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:11.802 align:middle line:90%
made out of energy.

00:40:11.802 --> 00:40:12.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I read.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.670 align:middle line:90%
So really, I can read anything.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what I'm sensing
is that this country right now

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.630 align:middle line:84%
is going through
some kind of turmoil.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But there seems to be
more people, Lauren,

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:84%
that I have run into that are
uptight, not happy, and very

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.080 align:middle line:90%
bitter about certain things.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel that, too?

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, yes.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just struggling
from the path of love to fear

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:90%
and popping back and forth.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.490 align:middle line:84%
We've known for decades that
this ascension that we're going

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:48.750 align:middle line:90%
through-- that's what it does.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.090 align:middle line:84%
It divides the path
of love and fear.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's the why we've created
such an alarming environment

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:56.640 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.920 align:middle line:84%
If I watch the news,
I can feel myself

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.182 align:middle line:84%
shifting from the path of
love to the path of fear.

00:41:01.182 --> 00:41:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's almost like
you don't want to watch it.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: That's it, yeah.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have
to for what I do.

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.990 align:middle line:84%
But there are many nights you'll
look at this and go, oh my God.

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.274 align:middle line:90%
How much of this can we take?

00:41:11.274 --> 00:41:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah, the conflict.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Road rage is out
of control, for example.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.297 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:41:16.297 --> 00:41:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
really struggling now.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe that's why
"Metaphysical Q&A" can help.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Because again, whatever
you're experiencing

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.500 align:middle line:84%
when you're watching
that TV show

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.630 align:middle line:84%
or interacting with that
person on the freeway--

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.410 align:middle line:84%
you really can control
it metaphysically.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:32.829 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you try
to calm people down?

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes, absolutely.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I try to give them the tools
that they can use on the fly--

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:39.210 align:middle line:84%
not to stop in the
middle of traffic

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and go into meditation,
but metaphysical tools

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.740 align:middle line:90%
that they can use right then.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your
biggest goal for you

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.080 align:middle line:84%
personally when you're
trying to teach these people

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.790 align:middle line:90%
or instruct them?

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think I
want to help them

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.040 align:middle line:84%
see the world from
a higher perspective

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and what their role
is in it, and in that,

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe adding more amusement and
being less serious about what's

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.670 align:middle line:90%
really happening.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this isn't real.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.320 align:middle line:90%
It's fairy tales, isn't it?

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.112 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, it's
really virtual reality.

00:42:11.112 --> 00:42:12.528 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
know, there are

00:42:12.528 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:84%
some that say that we are living
in that virtual reality world,

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.680 align:middle line:90%
that this is not real at all.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: That's how I see it.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.724 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is somebody going to
erase us at any given time,

00:42:21.724 --> 00:42:23.479 align:middle line:90%
and we're gone?

00:42:23.479 --> 00:42:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: That's what's so
interesting about the time we

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.730 align:middle line:90%
live in.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:30.390 align:middle line:84%
If I were to explain to
you how I see this reality,

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:34.060 align:middle line:84%
it is a virtual reality,
just like a computer game.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.570 align:middle line:84%
But think if I was trying to
tell you that 50 years ago

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.420 align:middle line:90%
before there was video games.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.070 align:middle line:90%
You would think I was insane.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:42.200 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't even be
able to understand.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I wouldn't get it.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: You wouldn't get it.

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.278 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wouldn't get it.

00:42:45.278 --> 00:42:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: So our
technology actually helps

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.680 align:middle line:90%
us understand the universe.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we went back
and talked to the ancients

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.620 align:middle line:84%
about our kind of technology
of today, they wouldn't get it.

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, my great
grandmother wouldn't get it.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.480 align:middle line:84%
She would be in the corner
rocking back and forth

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.722 align:middle line:90%
if she saw my cell phone.

00:43:01.722 --> 00:43:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
probably too young.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if you remember
the old "Dick Tracy" cartoons,

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.180 align:middle line:90%
where he'd talk in his watch.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.310 align:middle line:90%
And he'd do this.

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're doing
these things right now.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.085 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, the "Star
Trek" communicators.

00:43:14.085 --> 00:43:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who had the
ability then to foresee

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.030 align:middle line:90%
what the future would be like?

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:19.030 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.420 align:middle line:84%
I guess the science
fiction writers.

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly is.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We've got another clip
from one of your podcasts.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch it.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.770 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: Now, this one
comes from Betty S.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.390 align:middle line:10%
In Portland, Oregon.

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:32.820 align:middle line:10%
So thanks, Betty.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.770 align:middle line:10%
She says, I know
this may sound silly.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:39.150 align:middle line:10%
But I'm deathly afraid that
I'll marry the wrong guy.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:42.270 align:middle line:10%
How can I be sure that
the person I'm engaged to

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:44.767 align:middle line:10%
is my soulmate?

00:43:44.767 --> 00:43:46.020 align:middle line:10%
Crystal?

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.436 align:middle line:10%
>>CRYSTAL HEINEMANN:
Well, I think

00:43:47.436 --> 00:43:49.050 align:middle line:10%
this is a loaded question.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.670 align:middle line:10%
I'm happy to answer it.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.510 align:middle line:10%
I have lived through
this on this Earth plane

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:10%
and in several other lifetimes.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.250 align:middle line:10%
This really goes
back to contracts.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:00.600 align:middle line:10%
I think a lot of this
comes back to contracts.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.610 align:middle line:10%
So let's go back to that,
where really a soulmates--

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:08.260 align:middle line:10%
those are the
contracts that you have

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.470 align:middle line:10%
to live through the
most, the ones that

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:11.980 align:middle line:10%
have the most energy on it.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.060 align:middle line:10%
The ones that really
you learn the most from

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.370 align:middle line:10%
are your soulmate relationships.

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:21.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, because this question
is posed in a partnership

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:25.620 align:middle line:10%
little package, you're concerned
about marrying the right guy.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.870 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's talk about
soulmates a little bit.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:31.650 align:middle line:10%
Soulmates are not exclusive
to just romantic partnerships.

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.630 align:middle line:10%
And I also think
that a lot of people

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.560 align:middle line:10%
think that the
question of soulmate

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.500 align:middle line:10%
means that there's only
one, that only one exists.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.050 align:middle line:10%
And this is going to be
a lifelong partnership.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.910 align:middle line:10%
I think that's
really the context,

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:48.430 align:middle line:10%
the misnomer of what people have
identified a soulmate with--

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:50.050 align:middle line:10%
that you meet your soulmate.

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:51.260 align:middle line:10%
There's only one.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.930 align:middle line:10%
You hope that you
grab him or her.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:56.220 align:middle line:10%
What if you missed that one
chance of that soulmate?

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.290 align:middle line:10%
You're never going
to love again.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.840 align:middle line:10%
And then it's going to
be everlasting love,

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.310 align:middle line:10%
like that fairy tale.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:03.930 align:middle line:10%
And the way that we read it--

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:05.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't know about
you, Dr. Lauren.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.530 align:middle line:10%
But the way that I
read it is that we've

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:11.620 align:middle line:10%
got so many soul contracts
with different soulmates.

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:14.880 align:middle line:10%
Our best friends
are our soulmates.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.440 align:middle line:10%
Our siblings can be soulmates.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.630 align:middle line:10%
It's contracts that have
the most energy on it,

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:27.570 align:middle line:10%
the contracts that really
impact your life the most.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You let Crystal run
with the ball on that one.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: She's great.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She learned from you.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.060 align:middle line:84%
She's got a lot of
her own insight.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And she reads more
on the fly than I do.

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:37.320 align:middle line:90%
You can see her.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.230 align:middle line:84%
She's closing her eyes
when she's peaking.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Soulmates.

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Soulmates.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What are they?

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think they're the
people who sign the toughest

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:48.870 align:middle line:84%
contracts with you, the
ones that transform you

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.540 align:middle line:84%
the most, whether
you like that or not,

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.750 align:middle line:84%
whether you enjoy that
transformation or not.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is interesting
because people say that, I had

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:01.230 align:middle line:90%
a soulmate, but I got divorced.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Or we got separated.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.910 align:middle line:84%
How could that be if
we were soulmates?

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:08.364 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were never
soulmates in the first place.

00:46:08.364 --> 00:46:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I
guess it depends.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, if it was just
a passing relationship that

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:16.800 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really affect
you, a lot didn't really

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.110 align:middle line:84%
change you and transform you
a lot, then chances are not.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:24.060 align:middle line:84%
But even if it was a three-month
relationship that changed you

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:27.270 align:middle line:84%
forever, you're never going
to see that person again,

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:30.000 align:middle line:84%
that would still be
one of your soulmates.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Relationships
are top on the list

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.000 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of people.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Career, money, relationships
comes up all the time.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I know when I have psychics
on "Coast to Coast,"

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.480 align:middle line:90%
they want to know about that.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Why do you need to
ask somebody if I'm

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:46.590 align:middle line:90%
going to have a relationship?

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.202 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that something they
should know for themselves?

00:46:49.202 --> 00:46:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I
think what I would

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:52.370 align:middle line:84%
do if somebody is asking
me about relationships

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:53.960 align:middle line:84%
is I would look
at those contracts

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.540 align:middle line:84%
to see if they even have
an intimate relationship

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:57.980 align:middle line:90%
contract hanging out there.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of the
things that's really

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:02.180 align:middle line:90%
changing on this planet--

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.890 align:middle line:90%
is intimate relationships.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean just sexual
marriage-type things, just

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.490 align:middle line:84%
people that are really close
to one another, like Crystal

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:12.260 align:middle line:90%
and I, for example.

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.289 align:middle line:84%
I've only ever met her on the
planet one time in real life.

00:47:16.289 --> 00:47:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But you clicked.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: We absolutely click.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can see by our
podcast that we just play off

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.210 align:middle line:90%
each other so well.

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's how it works.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:26.960 align:middle line:90%
I had somebody call me once.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.230 align:middle line:90%
And he had a dream of a woman.

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And he's sitting at the
airport in real life

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and sees this woman from his
dream walking down the aisle.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:42.260 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, oh my God.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.520 align:middle line:90%
That's her.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.530 align:middle line:90%
He had to go up to her.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:48.440 align:middle line:84%
He probably figured, this girl
is going to think I'm crazy.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.970 align:middle line:90%
He goes up to her.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:54.830 align:middle line:84%
She stops and goes,
you're in my dream.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:58.380 align:middle line:84%
They were both separately
dreaming of each other.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:47:59.519 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:47:59.519 --> 00:48:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I would say that
these two people are in touch

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.110 align:middle line:90%
with their higher selves.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And when we dream,
we're actually

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:08.540 align:middle line:84%
on the astral, where
our higher selves are

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.970 align:middle line:90%
signing all those contracts.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And so they just happen
to be able to remember

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:16.592 align:middle line:84%
the things they're doing
on the astral together.

00:48:16.592 --> 00:48:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you told
me that story, it

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.030 align:middle line:90%
gave me goosebumps everywhere.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.930 align:middle line:90%
That's a great story.

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is a super story.

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:26.690 align:middle line:84%
How do we cut through
the morass of life

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:30.419 align:middle line:84%
and make this a pleasant
environment for all of us?

00:48:30.419 --> 00:48:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think letting
go of resistance--

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:33.876 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one
of the biggest things

00:48:33.876 --> 00:48:37.400 align:middle line:84%
that the environment on the
planet is asking us to do now.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:43.196 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people could draw lines
in the sand and defend them.

00:48:43.196 --> 00:48:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later,
the line's going

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.965 align:middle line:84%
to move the way the
world is right now.

00:48:47.965 --> 00:48:49.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the two
things that I try

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.100 align:middle line:84%
to do to easily live
through my contracts

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:55.120 align:middle line:84%
no matter what my higher self
is going to create next--

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.160 align:middle line:84%
is I try to set my
chakras to two energies.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And the energies-- I would like
them to be woven so tightly

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.400 align:middle line:84%
together that when
I'm in Lauren,

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and I'm reading
Lauren's information,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell the difference
between the two energies--

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:10.910 align:middle line:84%
and the energies are the
highest good of all--

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:12.990 align:middle line:90%
and my soul contracts.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So if I sit here
and get a chance

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.040 align:middle line:84%
to speak with you
on these topics,

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.380 align:middle line:90%
that's a great contract.

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.231 align:middle line:84%
If you want to play racquetball
with me and I kick your butt,

00:49:21.231 --> 00:49:22.230 align:middle line:90%
that's a great contract.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you probably would.

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:25.510 align:middle line:90%
But don't play chess with me.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:27.445 align:middle line:90%
I'll get you.

00:49:27.445 --> 00:49:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: So that's
what I think--

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.740 align:middle line:84%
is I try to set
myself to whatever

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.860 align:middle line:84%
new, crazy things my higher
self is going to create.

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Then I could just flow into them
without guilt or shame or pain,

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.550 align:middle line:90%
regret.

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about children?

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Do they need these
contracts, too?

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Oh, everybody
has contracts.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:46.010 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't even
have been here

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:47.259 align:middle line:90%
if they didn't have contracts.

00:49:47.259 --> 00:49:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think probably
parenting contracts

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:55.145 align:middle line:84%
have to be the toughest
to live through.

00:49:55.145 --> 00:49:56.360 align:middle line:90%
I've never had a kid.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But if I did and if I
was raising a child,

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I would feel taxed to allow them
to live through those contracts

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.480 align:middle line:84%
even if I did not like
what they were doing.

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you
have the parental guilt of,

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.560 align:middle line:84%
did I raise this
kid right or not?

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.019 align:middle line:84%
I think it would
be very difficult.

00:50:14.019 --> 00:50:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, I've
got three children,

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:17.240 align:middle line:90%
six grandchildren, Lauren.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Congratulations

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the way we
raise them is we never

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:23.070 align:middle line:90%
wanted them to get hurt.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:25.610 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
our responsibility

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:29.030 align:middle line:84%
to let them be who
they were but step in

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.820 align:middle line:84%
if you saw that possible
danger, whether it

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:36.350 align:middle line:84%
was drinking or playing
around with drugs or whatever.

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:39.040 align:middle line:84%
That's when we have
to step up as parents.

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't easy.

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my oldest
daughter, who is a gem now

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and has two kids of her
own, put us through hell.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one day
she was 16 years old.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And she went out drinking
with some of her friends.

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up throwing her in
the shower with cold water on

00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.660 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And then she got so bad
we had to ship her off

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:05.100 align:middle line:90%
to my sister in Detroit--

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.160 align:middle line:90%
we were in St. Louis--

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and put her in a
Catholic school there

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.130 align:middle line:90%
to get her straightened out.

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.550 align:middle line:90%
But it did.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:14.770 align:middle line:90%
It straightened her out.

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But we felt as parents you have
to step in when you see danger.

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, let
them be who they are.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that my contract
with her was that--

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:30.230 align:middle line:84%
step in to save them
from really getting hurt.

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:31.734 align:middle line:84%
And it made a big
difference for us.

00:51:31.734 --> 00:51:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And the change
that you and your wife

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and your other kids went through
by living through her contract.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is funny,
because my second daughter

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.175 align:middle line:84%
we put through
Catholic school, too,

00:51:42.175 --> 00:51:44.300 align:middle line:84%
not that they're any better
than the public system.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think they have a
little more discipline.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Then my son, who is the
youngest of the three--

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.070 align:middle line:90%
we put him in Catholic school.

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at his two
sisters and came running home

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.900 align:middle line:90%
to us one day, crying.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.260 align:middle line:90%
His name is Jonathan.

00:51:58.260 --> 00:51:59.810 align:middle line:90%
And I said, John, what's wrong?

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:00.610 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, why am
I in this school?

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:06.190 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:09.230 align:middle line:84%
It was his perception
of watching his two

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:14.210 align:middle line:84%
sisters getting put into these
schools for their attitude

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:16.230 align:middle line:84%
that we were doing
the same thing to him.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a
metamorphosis for us.

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But it was a different
contract with him.

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think sibling contracts
are very interesting.

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:25.130 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And again, I would say that the
big karma-creating contracts

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.660 align:middle line:84%
are marrying someone,
giving birth or having

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.430 align:middle line:84%
them give birth to
you-- parent-child--

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:35.540 align:middle line:90%
and then killing someone.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we don't
do that too much now.

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:42.050 align:middle line:84%
But all of those people
are the same soul

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:44.120 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.801 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into that because I
have a big question about that.

00:52:47.801 --> 00:52:50.277 align:middle line:84%
But are all relationships
contractual?

00:52:50.277 --> 00:52:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Good or bad?

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yes, even as those
contracts are changing.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I just had a client the
other day ask if her marriage

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:01.520 align:middle line:90%
contract was changing.

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:03.955 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
hard to live through.

00:53:03.955 --> 00:53:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
relationships that don't work?

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the divorce
rate is astronomical.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:10.601 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:53:10.601 --> 00:53:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, like I said, I
think that you're going to see

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:17.180 align:middle line:84%
the biggest shifts in your
relationship space as we move

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.492 align:middle line:84%
forward into the
ascension energy--

00:53:19.492 --> 00:53:21.200 align:middle line:84%
the people that you
want to hang out with

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and how close you want
those people to be,

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:25.730 align:middle line:84%
how much you're
willing to heal them,

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:28.160 align:middle line:84%
or how much you'll
allow them to heal you.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:33.427 align:middle line:84%
So I think the old "until
death do us part" contracts--

00:53:33.427 --> 00:53:34.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they work anymore.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.224 align:middle line:84%
And let me give
you a good example.

00:53:36.224 --> 00:53:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I think what a lot
of us are doing

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:41.090 align:middle line:84%
is we're actually putting
more than one lifetime

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:42.740 align:middle line:90%
into an incarnation.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.570 align:middle line:84%
For me, I was an
athlete and then

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:46.500 align:middle line:90%
an engineer and then a psychic.

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.130 align:middle line:84%
I could have been an athlete
and then died, come back

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:51.650 align:middle line:84%
as an engineer and died,
and come back as a psychic

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:52.450 align:middle line:90%
and died.

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But I crammed them
all into one lifetime.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think relationships are
just very much more dynamic

00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:58.539 align:middle line:90%
now than ever before.

00:53:58.539 --> 00:54:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've been on the
air sometimes, and I've died.

00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:04.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:08.670 align:middle line:84%
For people to move ahead
in their own lifestyle,

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:11.180 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
relationship or a career

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:15.590 align:middle line:84%
or this innermost happiness,
you need to find from within.

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing,
I think, more glorious

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.520 align:middle line:84%
than waking up in the
morning and just feeling good

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:26.390 align:middle line:84%
about life, whatever it is,
whether you have to go to work,

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:28.880 align:middle line:84%
or if you're in a relationship,
or whether you're not

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.870 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship.

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:33.140 align:middle line:84%
You're just yourself but
to be happy from within.

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you sign a soul
contract with yourself?

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I don't know if
that's so much a soul contract.

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:43.160 align:middle line:84%
What I think that would
be is releasing resistance

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.150 align:middle line:90%
to your contracts.

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Because look-- I
always say this.

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Higher self doesn't
shoot itself in the foot.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.230 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't think, I'm going
to incarnate and just have

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:52.850 align:middle line:90%
a terrible life.

00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:54.340 align:middle line:90%
That's not its intention.

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Its intention is to learn and
grow and have those adventures.

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So here on Earth-- again, it
has a lot to do with the society

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:05.220 align:middle line:84%
that we're raised in that says
this is good or this is bad.

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
my soul contract was--

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.620 align:middle line:90%
to be Lauren Cielo this time.

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.960 align:middle line:84%
I had to let go
of a lot of that.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Quite honestly, I probably
wouldn't still be here.

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:18.860 align:middle line:84%
I had to let go of what I
thought I was supposed to be.

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How can people tap into
that soul contract environment?

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:23.280 align:middle line:90%
How can they get into it?

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.655 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well
that's what I think

00:55:24.655 --> 00:55:26.730 align:middle line:84%
the teachings at
"Metaphysical Q&A" do.

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, it spans, just
like you mentioned,

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:31.190 align:middle line:84%
all the different
parts of our life--

00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:34.470 align:middle line:84%
children, family,
intimate relationships,

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:39.290 align:middle line:84%
health, career, money, personal
development for a few of them.

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is we
take a daily experience

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:44.510 align:middle line:90%
that you're having.

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're taking
a big test, right?

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:49.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a teaching
that will show you

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:53.420 align:middle line:84%
how you can leverage
easy-to-understand metaphysical

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:57.590 align:middle line:84%
terms to really get
out of your own way

00:55:57.590 --> 00:56:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy taking that test
whether you pass it or not.

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So we try to break it
down to each individual

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:08.330 align:middle line:84%
because that's where we moved
from the podcast of being

00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:10.894 align:middle line:84%
entertaining and
stimulating you to really--

00:56:10.894 --> 00:56:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: More informational.

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, to
give you something

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:16.070 align:middle line:84%
that you can really work with
to get more leverage here

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:17.150 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So what I think is I
noticed that my life kept

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.120 align:middle line:84%
getting easier and
easier and easier,

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.650 align:middle line:84%
because it was really
tough for a long time.

00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I would ask myself,
why is it so much easier now?

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you did our first
"Beyond Belief" five years ago,

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:35.550 align:middle line:90%
were you a happy person?

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think
I'm innately happy.

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I think I spent most of
my high school and college

00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:46.970 align:middle line:84%
avoiding who I was by excelling
in academics and sports.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't want to go where
I knew I was going to go.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.362 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the sand coming
out from underneath my feet.

00:56:53.362 --> 00:56:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or where you
knew you should go.

00:56:55.070 --> 00:56:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Right.

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was not raised
to be what I am.

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So I had to let go of
so much information

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:06.060 align:middle line:84%
in my space that wasn't
really my information.

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a long ride,
but it's been worth it.

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I would
think for people--

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:12.710 align:middle line:90%
for their lives to be easier--

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:15.380 align:middle line:84%
is to get out of the way
of your soul contracts.

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
desire to do something,

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.640 align:middle line:84%
to not think of it from a
standpoint of good or bad,

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.850 align:middle line:84%
but to think of it as, if
I'm having this desire,

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:28.520 align:middle line:84%
let me release any
resistance I have to it.

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.412 align:middle line:84%
And then see where
we go with it.

00:57:30.412 --> 00:57:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Because let's take a
contract to kill somebody.

00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's just go to
the far extreme.

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I have on
one color uniform

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:38.122 align:middle line:84%
and you have on
another, if I kill you,

00:57:38.122 --> 00:57:40.580 align:middle line:84%
they're probably going to give
me a parade when I get home.

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
get home, sadly.

00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yeah.

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:46.070 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm intoxicated,
and I run into your vehicle

00:57:46.070 --> 00:57:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and I kill you, now I have
all this guilt and shame.

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:51.720 align:middle line:84%
But metaphysically,
it's the same thing.

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the same contract.

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:56.000 align:middle line:84%
We think of one as good
and the other as bad.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.167 align:middle line:90%
But our higher self doesn't.

00:57:57.167 --> 00:57:58.875 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you believe
in reincarnation?

00:57:58.875 --> 00:57:59.989 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, absolutely.

00:57:59.989 --> 00:58:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So that soul does
incarnate, doesn't it?

00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And I also think that
souls combine and separate

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:06.740 align:middle line:90%
in incarnations.

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.260 align:middle line:90%


00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Part of me might be part of you.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:15.330 align:middle line:90%


00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bottom line
for an individual,

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:21.060 align:middle line:84%
what do you recommend that
someone who is just not quite

00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:24.300 align:middle line:84%
so sure of their life
and their lifestyle--

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.560 align:middle line:90%
what do they do?

00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I would say first
bump your self-esteem.

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:32.640 align:middle line:84%
We have been taught through the
religions here or the paradigms

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.190 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that we should
always be on our heels

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and always
second-guess ourselves.

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.750 align:middle line:10%
So when I talk to
people's higher selves,

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:44.652 align:middle line:10%
they have such glowing reviews
of the person here on Earth.

00:58:44.652 --> 00:58:45.860 align:middle line:10%
I'll give you a good example.

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I was making my bed.

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was beating
myself up in my head.

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't doing enough this, and
I was doing too much of that.

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And Ankaijia bursts into
my stream of consciousness.

00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.490 align:middle line:90%
He says, why are you doing that?

00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And we have this relationship
where I go, I'm making my bed.

00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:04.189 align:middle line:84%
All humans make
their bed, Ankaijia.

00:59:04.189 --> 00:59:05.980 align:middle line:84%
He goes, that's not
what I'm talking about.

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.700 align:middle line:84%
He goes, why are you
beating yourself up?

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, because I
just don't think I'm

00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:10.730 align:middle line:90%
doing what I need to be doing.

00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:12.864 align:middle line:90%
I could be doing so much better.

00:59:12.864 --> 00:59:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And he said something to me.

00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:18.930 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, why do you think
you're in body, and I'm not?

00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I haven't
really considered that.

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you're a
light worker in the ascension

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:25.440 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And if I was in body, I
couldn't do what you're doing.

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He couldn't do
what you're doing, yeah.

00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:31.167 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And I started
to cry because I

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:32.250 align:middle line:90%
don't see myself that way.

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all
think of our guides

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.730 align:middle line:90%
as these superior beings.

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:39.960 align:middle line:84%
But he just told me that I
could do a better job on Earth

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.360 align:middle line:90%
than he could.

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.735 align:middle line:84%
And I think most of us just
don't see ourselves that way.

00:59:43.735 --> 00:59:44.734 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, they don't.

00:59:44.734 --> 00:59:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Give us your website, Lauren.

00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:52.250 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: "Metaphysical Q&A"
is www.metaphysicalQA.com.

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:53.250 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Simple as that?

00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:53.760 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: Yep.

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great.

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Thanks again for
being on the program.

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Thanks for
having me, George.

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's not let five
more years go by, all right?

00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Let's not.

00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.040 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to sign
a soul contract with you.

01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:03.990 align:middle line:84%
You keep watching
"Beyond Belief."

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:05.520 align:middle line:90%
And I'll keep doing the show.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and
thanks for watching.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.760 align:middle line:90%
