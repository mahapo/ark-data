00:00:18.188 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And welcome to
this edition of Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:10%
Nanci Trivellato is with us.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:10%
She has investigated
extraordinary phenomena

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.770 align:middle line:10%
for more than three
decades, teaching thousands

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
around the world about
the theory and practice

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.920 align:middle line:10%
of out-of-body experiences,
psychic awareness, and energy

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle line:10%
sensitivity.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:84%
She is the author of
"Vibrational State and Energy

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Resonance," and the co-founder
of the International

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Academy of Consciousness.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:90%
That is fantastic.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.240 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
into this, Nanci?

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NANCI TRIVELLATO: Well, when
I was around 20 years old,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:10%
I started searching
for studies on whatever

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:10%
exists beyond physical world.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't agree
would be only this.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:10%
And what I noticed is that there
weren't many serious studies

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:10%
at that time, quite long ago.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I have had an
experience when I was young.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:84%
George, I'm going
to share with you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
some highlights because
I think they are very

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.380 align:middle line:90%
important to contextualize.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I am from a very
small town in Brazil.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
One of those that you would
know everyone in town.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:90%
So that is more--

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: 200 people, right?

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Well, maybe it was
like 1,000 at that time or so.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody would
pass away, at the church,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:84%
they would say, Oh, this person
passed away and everybody--

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Everybody knew that.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:90%
So everybody would know.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have a
television set at home.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.440 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have many books.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I was from a not so
well-to-do family.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
In that small city, we didn't
have cinema or a library

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that when
I was around seven years old,

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I had one of the experiences
that sometimes I used to have.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And my normal
experiences were such

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
that I would see my body
lying in bed, sleeping.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But I was so awake
that I could not make

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:90%
sense of what was going on.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.973 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: And it wasn't a dream.

00:02:13.973 --> 00:02:14.773 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: No.

00:02:14.773 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:90%
I was so awake.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:90%
Imagine at 6:00, 7:00.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
That happened for quite
some few years at that age.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I would look and say,
I should be dreaming.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.330 align:middle line:90%
I should not be awake.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
How can I be awake if
my body is sleeping?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:90%
It was that confusing.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah, it is.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: And then next morning,
a kid playing, that's OK.

00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:90%
And I wouldn't think of it.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.107 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No big deal.

00:02:40.107 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: No big deal.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Until one time, I left
my body and I ended up

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
in São Paulo city, which is I
never been there and never seen

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:90%
anything from São Paulo before.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge city.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Of course, everybody knows.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And many avenues
and huge buildings.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up in a room in a
hospital where an uncle of mine

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.102 align:middle line:90%
was being operated or had--

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you were
floating over him?

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I entered the hospital,
I was amazed what sort of place

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:90%
is this.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up in that
room and I saw him.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:84%
It was a bit shocking,
but not fearful.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And he had a sheet
covering him and a kind

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.270 align:middle line:84%
of a plastic tube like a
drain coming from his abdomen,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and directing like
a reddish liquid

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.667 align:middle line:84%
to a glass jar that
was on the floor.

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That was blood, right?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: That was blood.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know he
was ill or anything.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I did not know he
was having a surgery.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened is that,
again, I come back next morning

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:90%
and continue.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But when my aunt came back
from that trip and I told her,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
look, how is it possible
you should be just traveling

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:90%
for tourism?

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And I saw uncle Geno, that
was his name, in this place,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.770 align:middle line:90%
in this condition.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:90%
And I described the tube.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:90%
And she was so--

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: In shock.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: In shock.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
She was in shock
because we imagined

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
nobody studied anything
like this in my family.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So it was pretty much just
having the experience--

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.143 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And you were accurate
with what you described.

00:04:16.143 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:10%
>>NANCI: It was on the spot,
and I overheard her talking

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:10%
to my mother later on not
knowing I was close by.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible
that she saw that?

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:90%
It couldn't be.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But then they don't
talk about this anymore

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.388 align:middle line:84%
because this
produces fear maybe.

00:04:32.388 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They're scared.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: But in my
mind, I think if it's

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:84%
possible to have an
experience like this,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:90%
which I have had several.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
But to me, that is
very remarkable,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
have imagined that.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I am from the time
when TV sets, I

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
would have to watch TV
on the neighbor's house,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and it was all full of
different marks and signals.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
adjust the antenna.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: We call
that video noise.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.695 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Video noise.

00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:02.495 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:90%
It was still full of noise.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So I've never seen even
a hospital in my life.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:90%
So that was so accurate.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, we should
have serious studies.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to understand
more because I

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:90%
am eager to know whys and hows.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that
we are doing here?

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.185 align:middle line:90%
And how do we grow from inside?

00:05:23.185 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:90%
How do I become a better person?

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:90%
That has always been in my mind.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Were these
OBEs, these out-of-body

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
experiences happening
often to you?

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: At that age, yes,
very often and very easily.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.720 align:middle line:84%
I did not know so much how
to take advantage of them.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.788 align:middle line:84%
I would just experience the
sensation and float around.

00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they just
happen, because you didn't even

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:90%
know how to do it.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: I didn't even
know how to do it,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that it was an
important phenomenon happened

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:90%
very easily.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.956 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays not so easily
anymore, unfortunately.

00:05:54.956 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Now you know.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Now that I want them,
they are not there so easily.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But yes, that was very
remarkable, I guess.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to
become a researcher

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:90%
of the out-of-body experience.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:84%
But not only I
wanted to understand

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:84%
what is the bridge
between the physical world

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:90%
and the non-physical world?

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And how can so many
phenomena be explained?

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.477 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How were
you able to determine

00:06:21.477 --> 00:06:24.730 align:middle line:84%
the difference between the
physical and the spiritual?

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: That is the one
billion dollar question,

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%
because we can see that
from different perspectives.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
From the personal perspective,
how do we know what is a dream?

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:90%
What's imagination?

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:90%
And what's real?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very fair question
that not always the person

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.080 align:middle line:84%
who is experiencing
the phenomenon knows.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:84%
But in some cases,
it's so vivid, so

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:84%
clear that it's more vivid
than this world here.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And some people experience these
phenomena in a very natural

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.290 align:middle line:90%
spontaneous way.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So there are some
cases as remarkable

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:90%
and confirmed as the one I said.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:90%
But others very spontaneous one.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Nanci, how do you
explain the perceptions that

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:90%
go beyond the physical senses?

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:90%
What is this all about?

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: From all of my studies,
and that's a major area for me,

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
is to understand this bridge
between our physical senses

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.010 align:middle line:90%
and physical body and the brain.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And these non-local
perceptions and what people

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:90%
call astral body.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:90%
How do they bridge?

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.822 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible that someone
has an experience that--

00:07:33.822 --> 00:07:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Like you had.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Like I had, like
an out-of-body experience,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that basically we are
not inside the brain,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:84%
we are not using the brain,
and we can transfer information

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
from the memories that we have
from that experience to here.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So there is some
sort of energy that

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:84%
creates this bridge
that seems to be

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:84%
key in all of these
different psychic phenomena.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
One interesting
thing, George, is

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:84%
that so many people are somehow
sensitive to these energy.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:84%
People call it different
names, aura chakras.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I just like to call it energetic
interface or energy body,

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:90%
to be simpler.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that when we
study about physical body,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
we can study our physiology
and know how it works.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:90%
And have explanations.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.572 align:middle line:84%
But your physiology,
let's say, is

00:08:24.572 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:90%
slightly different than mine.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:84%
What you can eat will be
different than what I can eat.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
What is good for
you is different

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:84%
when we do an exercise,
physical exercise, some of us,

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:90%
we have more flexibility.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:84%
Some of us we have to take care
with some aspect of our let's

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:90%
say spine.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
We should have the same
type of knowledge in regards

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:90%
to the energy body.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:90%
But that is so neglected.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And one big effort
that I have been doing

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:84%
is how to compile
cases and information

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and logical explanations
that would at least give us

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.570 align:middle line:84%
some light into what is
an energy perception?

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:84%
What is it that we can pick
out of intuition or telepathy?

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:84%
What is it that happens when we
are close to someone, and all

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, we have an idea
that is absolutely related

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:84%
to that person, but we never
thought of that before?

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:90%
What explains that?

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of thing,
it's just because it's

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
so hard to explain, and it
is, and so hard to research,

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
I think it is just left
aside and just dismissed

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
as a general name like
intuition, gut feeling.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.610 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like to be more--

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I'd say logical, it's not
the word I'm looking for.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to be more
technical about that.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:90%
How it happened.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: When I
was 11 years old,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in bed
looking down at my body.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'm awake.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this
is not a dream.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, it slammed
me back into the body.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up again jarred
and said, what happened to me?

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the
bookstore and I was

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
walking around looking
for something that would

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:90%
explain what happened to me?

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And I found a book
called "Projections

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
of the Astral Body" by Hereward
Carrington and Sylvan Muldoon.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: It's wonderful.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they had a picture
on the book of an astral body

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:90%
floating over a physical body.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
this, 11 years old.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened to me.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of the reasons why

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I decided to get
into broadcasting

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:90%
to unravel these stories.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing thing.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: It's a great work
that you do, a great service,

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
because we need to bring
more awareness about this.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And we need to give a
platform for serious studies.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Theoretical scientists
and biologist Stuart Kauffman

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
describes a very profound
vision he had of a future event.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:84%
- And when she was 13, we
were living in Philadelphia.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And I picked Merit up
at her boyfriend's.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I did not want Merit at
13 to have a boyfriend.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:90%
- I see.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
- Merit wasn't going to
listen to her father.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And she said, daddy, I'm going
to walk home from Alex's house.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, any father of a
13-year-old daughter

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.498 align:middle line:84%
would be worried,
because I thought

00:11:11.498 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:90%
it was about three miles.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.950 align:middle line:90%
It was actually five miles.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:90%
And I picked her up.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And we pulled out
of Alex's driveway.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we pulled on to
a slightly larger street.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was absolutely
dumbstruck with terror

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle line:90%
as we drove past a tree.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:10%
And I saw Merit walking
down the middle of the lane

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:10%
and hit from behind
by a car and crushed.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.870 align:middle line:90%
And I was terrified.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Merit, don't ever
walk home from Alex's house.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.350 align:middle line:10%
You call mom or me day or night.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.310 align:middle line:90%
And Merit was silent.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm
having an argument

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:90%
with my teenage daughter.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going
to lose this one.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.410 align:middle line:84%
She's entering a
dangerous period.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.425 align:middle line:84%
If she makes it to
16, she'll be fine.

00:11:54.425 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Then she said,
don't worry daddy.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.990 align:middle line:84%
If I walk home, I'll call you
from the Roy Rogers up here.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, that's
an OK compromise.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
But a month later, Merit
was over at Alex's.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:90%
He broke up with her.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And Merit walked out and
she did almost what I said.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
She was walking down
the middle of the lane

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and was hit from
behind by a car.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Not quite, but approximately,
and killed on the very spot

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:90%
where I saw it happening.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't gotten over it.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.080 align:middle line:90%
It was 32 years ago.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So I can account for being
worried that any parent would.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But I can't account for the
specificity of that image,

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.160 align:middle line:84%
nor can I account for the
fact that the next morning,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I called a woman
named Linda Haley.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I've known Linda
since she was born.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:90%
And I was three.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And I told her that
Merit had died.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.070 align:middle line:84%
My God, last night I had a
dream that you were crushed

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and crumpled in grief on
your dining room floor.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And Liz, my wife, was
behind me holding me.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:90%
And then it wasn't me.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:84%
She said I thought
you were dying.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.498 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't Linda
have that dream?

00:13:01.498 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:84%
We hadn't talked to one
another for eight months.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:90%
And she was 2,000 miles away.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:90%
These things happen sometimes.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:90%
- Yes.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Too much to be a coincidence.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:90%
- It's real.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So to jump ahead, I think
telepathy is possible.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:84%
If the mind body system is
quantum classical, which

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it probably is,
then via non-locality,

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.630 align:middle line:84%
which we can get to, I think
that something telepathic

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:90%
can happen.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be very
evanescent because it

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:90%
relies on entanglement.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And entanglement
is very evanescent.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So getting reliable stable
data is going to be very hard.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:90%
But we don't take it seriously.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I think we're just
being stubborn.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:90%

>>NANCI: Yes.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.495 align:middle line:84%
And he candidly shared that I

>>GEORGE: When he
was telling you

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:90%
that, what were you thinking?

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: I was
thinking how brave

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.820 align:middle line:90%
he was to go through that.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:90%
How painful that must have been.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And thinking how amazing
that this sort of thing

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:84%
happened to those that never had
an experience, never studied,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's much more common
than we would think.

of these experiences?

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes, I have.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What happened?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: I have been
afraid a few times.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.383 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What scares you?

00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: But especially,
like some entities

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:84%
around that were not nice, not
in my out-of-body experience.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
My out-of-body
experience, I guess

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:90%
they were always kind of nice.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
vivid than others.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:84%
But when I was
around 13, George,

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:84%
we moved from that
small city that

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:84%
was very peaceful and
clean to another city

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't fancy very much.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:84%
But the point was that we had to
move from one house to another

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.280 align:middle line:90%
until we find our place.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:84%
In one of the
houses that we were,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I started sensing there was
some sort of ghosts there,

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to put it this way.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:90%
And I was afraid.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid because
I would wake up

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
every night in the middle
of the night sensing

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.040 align:middle line:90%
that they were very--

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.873 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Petrified.

00:15:10.873 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Petrified.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.670 align:middle line:90%
That is exactly the word.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Petrified.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't move.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:90%
I was in terror.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And that would last a long
time, one hour, two hours.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did you
tell your parents?

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.398 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: I did not
know how to say.

00:15:26.398 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: So you kept
this within yourself?

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: I kept-- I would
tell my mother I'm afraid.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know afraid of what.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And after some time, I started
becoming even shyer than I was,

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.760 align:middle line:90%
more and more shy.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You?

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Believe it or not.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:84%
This sort of sensitivity in
childhood made me very shy,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:84%
because I would sense people's
energy in different places.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know to
me it was very hard.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.460 align:middle line:84%
But then later, of course, I
learned how to work with energy

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:90%
and balance that.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But those experiences, they
were very, very impactful,

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:90%
traumatic.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Even took me a long time
to let go of that fear.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say that they
left deep marks in myself.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Scarred you?

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Scarred
me because there

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.220 align:middle line:84%
were cases in which I was
about to leave the body,

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.730 align:middle line:90%
and I would react automatically.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Although I have had so many
out-of-body experiences before,

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.990 align:middle line:84%
but sensing the
non-physical world

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and that so many people and
entities bullying me only

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:84%
was not threatening me in any
direct way that today I know.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:44.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just having fun of
making a child scared.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And so many children
go through it.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:84%
But when I sense
that and sometimes I

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:84%
would leave my body,
it's not that I

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to
leave the body, it's

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.980 align:middle line:84%
just that it was an automatic
reaction, pretty much

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:90%
like post-traumatic syndrome.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
block the experience.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, I overcame that.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Muldoon
and Carrington wrote

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:84%
that there are levels in
the astral plane you do not

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:90%
want to stop off at.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Have you encountered that?

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: I have.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:84%
And I found in my
experience that when

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
you go into the real spirit
world, so I say spirituality

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.250 align:middle line:84%
is about being a
spirit out there.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.330 align:middle line:84%
We are spirits in
the physical body.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So the actual spirituality
is us getting closer

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:39.270 align:middle line:84%
to our true nature and seeing
what is the spirit world,

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:90%
the non-physical world.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And I have been to
places that it gave me

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:90%
a frame of how low we can be.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.780 align:middle line:90%
We, I mean beings--

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:90%
human beings.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I have been places that I
saw people that were really

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:90%
not very good condition.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
If I may describe, then you
see if you keep it or not.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.926 align:middle line:84%
But pretty much a bit
like what we see in "What

00:18:04.926 --> 00:18:06.730 align:middle line:90%
Dreams May Come" movie.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: With Robin Williams.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Some places were like that.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But when I am there, I'm
never afraid because I

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:90%
am in that reality.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
But I also have been to
places and encountered

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:25.450 align:middle line:84%
people that are so much beyond
any description we hear here

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
in our world of an advanced
person, an enlightened person.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And I say goodness, we
should aim at becoming better

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:84%
because there is so
much ahead of us,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
because we can see this huge
gap, this huge difference

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:84%
from the condition, the internal
condition of some individuals

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and of others who have already
developed some, perhaps

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:84%
the skills I would
say or attributes

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:90%
that we are still learning them.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.388 align:middle line:90%
That's what I would say.

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do you
think, though, Nanci,

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:90%
an out-of-body experience is?

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Why do we do these?

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: I think that
is a natural phenomenon.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Very natural that,
unfortunately, society in a way

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:90%
represses it.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.812 align:middle line:90%
Nowadays it is a bit better.

00:19:15.812 --> 00:19:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They
don't understand it.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.562 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: They don't understand.

00:19:18.562 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:90%
They are afraid of it, right?

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:90%
And fear plays a big role.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Some are.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, society
in general, when

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:84%
we think of the
large population,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
thankfully nowadays we
have shows like yours

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and so many people bring
information about this

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:39.490 align:middle line:84%
in the internet basically, which
is there for everyone, which

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
is a great thing because
it's more accessible,

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.990 align:middle line:84%
but also a dangerous thing,
because we do not have

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:90%
an FDA of the spirituality.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes crazy.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Not certified.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Exactly.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's good, but sometimes
crazy things come up,

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:90%
and people just fall for it.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:84%
But then what happens is
that when we think of fear,

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:90%
inquisition to start with.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you couldn't have
any of the sensitivity.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.200 align:middle line:84%
We had to really repress
everything and be

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:90%
afraid of saying persecuted.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And then later on science
comes, which was great.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
But the way, I guess, in my mind
to understand science had to do

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:84%
is if anything is not purely
physical, it's just rubbish.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:90%
And you can study it as rubbish.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen so many
programs, George, sharing this

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.970 align:middle line:84%
here with you is so
important for me.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So many programs that I
could tell my experience.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And I could teach people
techniques to leave the body.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But I could not say
it's scientific.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.645 align:middle line:10%
Even at TEDx talk I did in
which I presented some--

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Maybe there's
no science behind it.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NANCI: Exactly.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So even in that talk,
they go and they say,

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is not scientific.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:90%
We cannot recognize this.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And I say goodness, I'm talking
about science the whole time.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing
because if we do not

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge that there
is a way to study this,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:84%
if we do not look for
methodologies for ways, then

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be all lost.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
But I guess this
natural capacity

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:19.150 align:middle line:84%
that we have of leaving the body
is a lot now covered with fear,

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.065 align:middle line:84%
because of these two recent
situations that we have,

00:21:23.065 --> 00:21:27.730 align:middle line:84%
like inquisition and
the science precepts.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, those who
can accept and acknowledge

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
their experience,
it's an exception.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Even in our everyday
life, not everyone

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:84%
can say they have an
out-of-body experience,

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.407 align:middle line:90%
not even to their relatives.

00:21:41.407 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Does science even
try to explain what an OBE is?

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: No.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:84%
The conventional
science really not.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Let's take a look at
Italian physicist and designer

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.330 align:middle line:84%
of the first microprocessor,
chip Federico Faggin,

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.780 align:middle line:84%
who talks about describing an
out-of-body experience that he

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:84%
- The turning experience for me
happened when I was 48 or 49.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And for a number
of years before, I

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:84%
was interested in understanding
the nature of consciousness.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to make a conscious
computer, or not to make,

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:84%
but find out if it was possible
to make a conscious computer.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I was exploring
on my spare time

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that idea, thinking that
if in fact consciousness

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:84%
is an epiphenomenon or
is an emergent property

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
of a complex system,
well, then a computer

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.960 align:middle line:90%
should be able to be conscious.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So the more I thought, the
more impossible it appeared.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:55.828 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of also
somewhat frustrated.

00:22:55.828 --> 00:22:59.140 align:middle line:84%
In those days, I was a
materialist, a physicalist.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:84%
I thought that the
science had the answers,

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and that the world
is made of matter.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end of it.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness is
probably an epiphenomenon.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And so-- but I was interested.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.970 align:middle line:90%
I was not giving up.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And at some level, I think
I pray to understand.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I ended up having
a extraordinary experience

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:29.920 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.750 align:middle line:84%
What generally
would be classified

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:90%
as a mystical experience.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to put names
because it doesn't really help.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Where fundamentally I
experienced myself as love,

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:90%
and I was love.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was the universe,
which was made of love.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:84%
But I was also the observer
of the universe that

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:90%
is me that is made of love.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So this experience changes
all the fundamental paradigms

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of physicality that you have,
because in ordinary experience,

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I am a body existing
inside a world ,

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and the world is objective, and
I interact with other bodies,

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm separate from the
world, and all of that.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But in this experience,
I am the world.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.290 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also the
observer of the world.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And the world is
not made of things.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.790 align:middle line:90%
It's made of love.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So that was about 20
seconds to a minute.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.778 align:middle line:90%
And it changed my life.

00:24:34.778 --> 00:24:35.578 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:35.578 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Changed his
life indeed, didn't it?

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Indeed.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Indeed deeply.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And now he's dedicating to
study about consciousness.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of phenomena that
points to us that we are not

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.060 align:middle line:90%
the brain actually.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is not
a result of the brain.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Is not an epiphenomenon
of the brain.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's brilliant,
because scientists as Faggin

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and as Kauffman that we
saw before, when they have

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.270 align:middle line:84%
experiences, I guess a
true scientist must then

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.770 align:middle line:90%
acknowledge, right?

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I experienced something
that is different.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I never knew this existed.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:90%
I need to find explanation.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:84%
But what happens in real life
is that most scientists will not

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.093 align:middle line:84%
admit that, will not say
because they are afraid--

00:25:25.093 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They
don't have answers.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: They
don't have answers,

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.243 align:middle line:84%
but they also they are
afraid they are going

00:25:29.243 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:90%
to be judged by their peers.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.160 align:middle line:84%
They are going to be
seen in a bad light.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.827 align:middle line:84%
And people are going to
say now they are mystical

00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:38.785 align:middle line:90%
and they are becoming--

00:25:38.785 --> 00:25:39.785 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Ridicule them.

00:25:39.785 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Yes, and no
longer scientific.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:90%
So it's again a pity.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But I admire very much
these two gentlemen,

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I
was talking to them

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that could accept their
experiences, say the truth,

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and say I do not know
exactly what happens,

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.950 align:middle line:90%
but that's what happened.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And let's look for answers
in very technical ways.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And that's happening
to millions of people.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Millions.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Millions.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's amazing.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:90%
What is VELO?

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: VELO is a method
to work with energy.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:84%
I was saying that
the key to all--

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did you develop this?

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Did you develop it?

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Yes, I
developed this method.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But I developed based
on existing techniques,

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:84%
because this method is
based on a technique that

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:84%
is there from the
time of Buddha,

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and have been used in
many different areas.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But people would just
do it in very let's

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:84%
say eerie ways, just
trying to do something.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.315 align:middle line:84%
Each of them using a
different approach.

00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What does
it stand for, VELO?

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: VELO, it's Voluntary,
Energetic, Longitudinal,

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Oscillation, which
pretty much describes

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.710 align:middle line:90%
what the technique does.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Sounds pretty
scientific to me.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:84%
But it's very simple
because something

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:90%
we do at will, voluntary.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Energetic, it's our energy.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Longitudinal, because it's
longitudinal in our body.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And oscillation,
because it keeps moving.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's a movement of
energy inside of our bodies

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.290 align:middle line:90%
that goes upwards and downwards.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:90%
And this is ancient.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's a
workable technique?

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: It's very
workable technique.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that
the fears that I had,

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and when we think
of what is the key

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.770 align:middle line:84%
to have all of these
phenomena, and the key

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:84%
to be able to really master
the out-of-body experience.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And to really know what to
do when you are out there.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:90%
And how things are happening.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:47.350 align:middle line:84%
This technique is so important
because it gives one almost

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
like a fitness workout
of the whole energy body,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:57.430 align:middle line:84%
this exact energy that is
connecting us here in this body

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.220 align:middle line:84%
as a consciousness
attached to this body,

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and the non-physical
astral body.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
with this technique

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
is that when I
was practicing it,

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.980 align:middle line:84%
like I said in
very loose ways, I

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.520 align:middle line:84%
started noticing that there were
some ways that I would do it

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:90%
that would give me more results.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And I then started
practicing that way.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And later on, I
decided to research

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.520 align:middle line:84%
what was the best way
to do this technique?

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Because, George, let
me share this with you.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.900 align:middle line:90%
It's very nice.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I was then afraid
that I told you

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.030 align:middle line:84%
got traumatized from
those experiences,

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.530 align:middle line:84%
sensing those
entities, and there

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:84%
are some situations that happen
that they seem out of a movie.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: A bad movie.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Bad movie.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And to a point that I had
to sleep with the lights on.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:90%
I was like 25.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.260 align:middle line:84%
I had to sleep
with the lights on.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: 25 years old
and you had the lights on.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.562 align:middle line:84%
And some places I would go
and I wouldn't sleep at all.

00:29:00.562 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I bet you didn't go
into closets either, did you?

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: No, not at all.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Not even look at them sometimes.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I--
long corridors,

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:09.770 align:middle line:90%
they would be very frightening.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how
some horror movies,

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.905 align:middle line:84%
they know what to pick
to impress people.

00:29:15.905 --> 00:29:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Of course, because they
hear stories and they

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.850 align:middle line:84%
know what people are afraid
of and what they experience.

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:84%
But then I learned
this technique.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And then when I started
doing it, like in two weeks,

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:90%
I was no longer afraid.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:84%
It was something out
of a miracle to me.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did it help
you go out of the body?

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Then I start
regaining the control

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:43.390 align:middle line:84%
to go out of the body at will,
because spontaneously, this

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.190 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to be able
to perform it at will.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And I would be able to
go to a place by myself.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Even a place that I don't know
completely dark, I was OK.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And if I would sense something
that would seem fearful,

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.825 align:middle line:90%
I knew what to do.

00:29:59.825 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I knew what to do
with my energy.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I knew how to protect myself.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:84%
I knew how to
establish barriers.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Before, of course, I tried many
different techniques, many.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.970 align:middle line:90%
And they work for some people.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.140 align:middle line:90%
People say they work.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:13.992 align:middle line:90%
To me, they didn't.

00:30:13.992 --> 00:30:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you teach other
people these techniques?

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: I do teach.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's perhaps
the number one thing

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.970 align:middle line:90%
that I teach nowadays.

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I am so happily amazed
and impressed with the results

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.730 align:middle line:90%
much more than I expected.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
some recent research

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:84%
with the general public,
because, of course,

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:84%
my research I did with it was
15 years of research that I did.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Was not one year.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:46.080 align:middle line:84%
It's long time, long time
to come up with a proper way

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.280 align:middle line:90%
to do this technique.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And then with the proper
way of doing this technique,

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.550 align:middle line:84%
another research was done,
not by myself, by my sister.

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Actually, she works with me.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Anna Laura is her name.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.150 align:middle line:84%
But Anna Laura did
a research that

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:04.860 align:middle line:84%
was to infer what sort
of experience people

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.317 align:middle line:84%
would have with
the VELO technique.

00:31:07.317 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, you've had
an influence on people.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, a student
who practiced your VELO

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
technique describes her
out-of-body experience

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.700 align:middle line:84%
encountering, of anything,
her deceased father.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.300 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.680 align:middle line:10%
- Two years ago,
I lost my father,

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.390 align:middle line:10%
and I have a bit of
lingering feelings of guilt,

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:10%
unresolved situation with him.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.180 align:middle line:10%
So I really wanted
to learn how to do

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:10%
out-of-body experience,
because I have

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:10%
a profound need of
seeing him, in some way,

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.910 align:middle line:10%
asking for forgiveness.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.770 align:middle line:10%
I don't question why,
but I really need that.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:50.310 align:middle line:10%
In my search for
knowledge is when I found

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:54.090 align:middle line:10%
the CDP course and the IAC.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.640 align:middle line:10%
I started doing the
course, I started

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:10%
practicing the techniques.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.110 align:middle line:10%
VELO was an amazing
technique for me

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.510 align:middle line:10%
to start the vibrational state.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:10%
It really helped me
how to manage my fear.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:10%
Learning about non-physical
beings, learning

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.330 align:middle line:10%
about how to deal
with that also really

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.280 align:middle line:10%
made a change in my fear.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.900 align:middle line:10%
I was able then
to meet my father.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.825 align:middle line:10%
I have that moment that
really change my life.

00:32:24.825 --> 00:32:27.510 align:middle line:10%


00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.420 align:middle line:10%
I know it was him because
he kissed me in the way

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.470 align:middle line:10%
that he used to when I was
a child before going to bed.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:38.340 align:middle line:10%
At that moment,
that reconciliation,

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.140 align:middle line:10%
that forgiveness,
that changed my life.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is she one
of your students?

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.750 align:middle line:84%
She was one of our students, and
a student of the International

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Academy of Consciousness.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now the
VELO technique,

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.960 align:middle line:84%
give us some highlights
on what it is?

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: VELO technique is a
way of moving our own energy,

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:84%
like saying of
all of our chakras

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.530 align:middle line:84%
to put it in very simple
terms, from inside

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.120 align:middle line:84%
of our bodies upwards
and downwards,

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:84%
but in a specific
rhythm, focusing

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:84%
on specific attributes
of the technique

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.030 align:middle line:90%
to take the most out of it.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like it
aligns all of the energy,

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and kind of start rushing
from inside our energy body,

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.570 align:middle line:84%
and making everything
move and go into shape.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots
of good results

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:84%
from that, because it gives us a
stronger aura and energy field.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.140 align:middle line:90%
So better self-defense.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:39.300 align:middle line:84%
But also it helps us develop
our own sensitivity in ways

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.250 align:middle line:84%
that we know how to
apply our energy.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And since the energy that
connects the physical body

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and the non-physical,
the astral body

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:51.600 align:middle line:84%
is this very same energy
that we are talking about,

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.910 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the
energy body and chakras.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.010 align:middle line:84%
It's different names
for the same thing.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:00.490 align:middle line:84%
When we do VELO, we start
melting down this energy.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So the interface between these
two bodies, it's more flexible.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:08.219 align:middle line:84%
We become more sensitive,
but more balanced.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:12.120 align:middle line:84%
We know better how to detect
when something we are thinking

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.730 align:middle line:90%
or feeling is not totally ours.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:16.440 align:middle line:84%
We are picking from
the environment

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.929 align:middle line:84%
and from some other energy,
or somebody sending those vibe

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:25.000 align:middle line:84%
to us, or even some spiritual
presence, some entities that

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.340 align:middle line:90%
could be around influencing us.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So VELO helps us to identify
that, helps us to be ourselves,

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and helps a lot with the
out-of-body experience.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is the
International Academy

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.080 align:middle line:90%
of Consciousness?

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: It's an organization
that I am part of.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.719 align:middle line:10%
It's a non-profit organization.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:47.120 align:middle line:10%
We have a research
campus in Portugal.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.420 align:middle line:10%
And we specialize in teaching
these ideas and these phenomena

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:59.080 align:middle line:10%
in very much a scientific way
to the extent possible nowadays.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:10%
And we aim at helping people
to understand their experience,

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:10%
and to go beyond by themselves.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:10%
Eliminating any possibility
of going to a cult,

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.920 align:middle line:10%
because so many people, they
do not know what to look for.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.940 align:middle line:90%
They want answers.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go for answers?

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's without any
ideological base,

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:26.320 align:middle line:84%
teaching all of these ideas,
but in a practical way.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Theory and practice.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Is there a
downside to practicing OBEs?

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Is there a consequence?

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Yes, but not
to practicing OBEs.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But I have to be
very clear that when

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:43.030 align:middle line:84%
we talk about energy,
energy body, chakras,

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:84%
techniques, leaving the body,
none of that is dangerous.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.100 align:middle line:84%
However, like anything
in life, if you

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.088 align:middle line:84%
are going to run and
prepare for a marathon,

00:35:53.088 --> 00:35:54.130 align:middle line:90%
you don't do it properly.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.900 align:middle line:90%
You may injure your knees.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And what is the risk
that one would have?

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to
call it danger.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's a risk.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:05.560 align:middle line:84%
If someone does a
technique without knowing

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:84%
what sort of energies
around, without knowing

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:84%
if they are more or less
sensitive, what they are

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:16.000 align:middle line:84%
prone to experience,
they may end up

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.790 align:middle line:84%
connecting with
things not so nice.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And later on have
energetic problems,

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.510 align:middle line:84%
spiritual problems that
they will have to deal with.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.440 align:middle line:90%
That happens a lot.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why, for example, in the
CDP Consciousness Development

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Program that we teach
at the IAC, what we do

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:35.650 align:middle line:84%
is that we start
with the basics.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:39.610 align:middle line:84%
People do not learn out of bad
experience the first class.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And normally when somebody goes
to a course on astral travel,

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.120 align:middle line:84%
they go technique,
technique, technique.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Takes time.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Takes time,
but also I think

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:54.520 align:middle line:84%
the instructors are counting on
people not being so sensitive,

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.380 align:middle line:84%
not leaving their
body so easily,

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.060 align:middle line:90%
and not experiencing a lot.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.350 align:middle line:90%
But there can be side effects.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is
that we carefully

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.850 align:middle line:84%
teach how it happens,
why, what sort of energy

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
exercises you need
to do to be prepared.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.870 align:middle line:90%
This, getting some bad energy.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Some people, they--

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Can it hurt you?

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Connected
with you, yes.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It could.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
having nightmares.

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you may feel you
are not so focused anymore,

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:84%
or some situations in life
happen that is not normal.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.430 align:middle line:84%
It is out of the
ordinary in a bad way.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.600 align:middle line:90%
This can happen.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And many people experience this.

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And come to me in
private sessions

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:46.260 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes to the
IAC, seeking for ways

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.610 align:middle line:90%
of getting out of that.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:84%
It's so much better
if people learn

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:54.840 align:middle line:84%
correct from the beginning,
so much better because we

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.990 align:middle line:84%
can develop so much
without any fear,

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:00.120 align:middle line:84%
knowing what is
going on, knowing

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.930 align:middle line:90%
what to do in each case.

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.710 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
sometimes people, they

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:10.910 align:middle line:84%
are looking for opportunities to
experience the spiritual world.

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And they do not know
what is behind it.

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.160 align:middle line:84%
They do not know
what technique--

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.930 align:middle line:90%
what technique to choose.

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Will science ever
accept this as a phenomenon?

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: I think it's going
to take time, because science

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.830 align:middle line:90%
demands replicability.

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And for someone, a
scientist, to understand

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.550 align:middle line:84%
what we are talking
about, they need

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.350 align:middle line:90%
to have some sort of experience.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can understand what
an out-of-body experience is.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.878 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to hear an account.

00:38:41.878 --> 00:38:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: They want data.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: They want
data, repeatable.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.930 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to hearing an
account from you, for example,

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:50.580 align:middle line:84%
George, what you
told us, and say,

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:84%
wow, that is very much
possible how it normally

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:84%
happens and probably
veridical because there

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:02.120 align:middle line:84%
are many thousands of other
descriptions in the same way.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.730 align:middle line:90%
But they do not know.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.060 align:middle line:90%
They never experience.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.130 align:middle line:90%
They are not able to research.

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:12.590 align:middle line:84%
You cannot research something
that you do not know what is it

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that you are trying
to find out about?

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:17.730 align:middle line:84%
What is the problem you
are trying to solve?

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:84%
What is the phenomenon
you are trying to explain.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:21.450 align:middle line:90%
They only know.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Some people claim they
were out of the body.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there are
neurological explanations

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:32.130 align:middle line:84%
that one can sense it when
certain areas of the brain

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.330 align:middle line:90%
is stimulated.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can
dream of anything.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.750 align:middle line:84%
We can dream of the smell of
our mothers when we were five.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.618 align:middle line:84%
And it's only a dream, because
that's a memory we have.

00:39:42.618 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's locked in.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: It's locked in.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So we are not saying
it's not possible to have

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.580 align:middle line:84%
some experience like
this, that they are just

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.570 align:middle line:84%
a result of
neurological patterns.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.950 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it's possible.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:59.460 align:middle line:84%
However, saying
that all of them,

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.770 align:middle line:90%
it's just your mind creating.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.930 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing, just coincidence.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:06.600 align:middle line:90%
That is a big, big leap.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
where the problem lies.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: In your
out-of-body experiences,

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:84%
have you ever seen
the umbilical cord?

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:16.200 align:middle line:84%
They've talked so much
about that connection

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.810 align:middle line:84%
between the physical
body and the astral body.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Once I've seen
when I was a child.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They say if
it's severed, you die.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: How do you
sever the silver cord?

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what I always
try to discuss,

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:34.230 align:middle line:84%
because of course here,
if you have light coming

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and you position something
in this direction,

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:37.680 align:middle line:90%
you create shadow.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.710 align:middle line:84%
But if we think
of light in a way

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that one beam of light and you
turn other beam of light here,

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:47.490 align:middle line:90%
it's just going to pass through.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.200 align:middle line:90%
We are talking about dimensions.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.900 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about
energies that they

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.200 align:middle line:90%
are of different frequencies.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They belong to different layers
in this non-physical dimension.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So I don't see how
the silver cord

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.963 align:middle line:84%
could be severed with
everything I have witnessed.

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And it elongates
no matter how far you go.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: It elongates.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.670 align:middle line:84%
If people can have
experiences that they

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:14.193 align:middle line:90%
went to other planets--

00:41:14.193 --> 00:41:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: In an astral body.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.485 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: In an astral body.

00:41:16.485 --> 00:41:19.260 align:middle line:84%
In a matter of sometimes
a couple of minutes,

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and there are many accounts
like that, or seconds even.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So what would create a
problem to that silver cord?

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:30.360 align:middle line:84%
The problem that
I do see is when

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.730 align:middle line:84%
people are very
close to the body

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and still not in full
control, and they

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:84%
may be surprised by something
that may shock them, even

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.840 align:middle line:90%
good things.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.423 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And that
pulls them back in.

00:41:41.423 --> 00:41:43.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: That
pulls them back in.

00:41:43.165 --> 00:41:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's what
happened to me when I was 11.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:48.268 align:middle line:84%
It was that shock of
seeing my little body wham.

00:41:48.268 --> 00:41:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: And did you have
other experiences after this?

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Never.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:52.370 align:middle line:90%
I've never been able to do it.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: You are describing
exactly what so many people

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:59.180 align:middle line:84%
have, because the
surprise, the shock--

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: I've studied it.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed people like
you who are the best at this.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.350 align:middle line:84%
But I've only done it the one
time, and it was by accident.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Exactly.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:09.750 align:middle line:90%
And you could never forget that.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So we know it's not
the same of a dream.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:17.060 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is this surprise,
even of a good thing that

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.160 align:middle line:84%
makes us come back
suddenly to the body

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.250 align:middle line:84%
usually creates a mechanism
similar to the one

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.600 align:middle line:90%
I created with my trauma.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Let me ask you this--

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.458 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: That holds us.

00:42:25.458 --> 00:42:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: When you're
going to bed, sometimes

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.350 align:middle line:84%
right before you
fall asleep, you

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:34.310 align:middle line:84%
feel a jarring effect, something
like something hits you.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:90%
And you wake up again.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Is that the astral
body starting to leave?

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: Yes.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:84%
From what we have observed,
and in some cases witnessing

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that when we are still awake,
yes, because we start relaxing.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.310 align:middle line:90%
These energies, they loosen up.

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And then some parts of our
bodies or the whole body

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:56.160 align:middle line:84%
just detach, and
we are surprised,

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.390 align:middle line:90%
we are not expecting.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.940 align:middle line:84%
We are still very much
connected to the physical body.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a jerk,
which is the same process

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.640 align:middle line:90%
of the sleep paralysis.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Same thing.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:07.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NANCI: Yes, we
start detaching.

00:43:07.975 --> 00:43:10.650 align:middle line:84%
You are just slightly
out, but you are not out.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you still in
the same perspective

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.400 align:middle line:84%
of the physical body here,
still perceiving reality

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.200 align:middle line:84%
from this area, but you are
not fully inside the body.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So you try to move, you
try to control your body,

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and you can't.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And some people feel very
afraid, very trapped.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes some
entities take advantage

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:90%
to make them even more afraid.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But never heard of
anyone having a problem

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:38.500 align:middle line:84%
during sleep paralysis that
was like a permanent problem

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.580 align:middle line:90%
or serious things.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.530 align:middle line:90%
It's more of being afraid.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:44.170 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many sensations
that happen at that moment.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.220 align:middle line:90%
The jerk awake.

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.720 align:middle line:90%
Sensations of vibration.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes rocking, swinging,
feeling very light,

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.210 align:middle line:90%
feeling very heavy.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Also same process.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Sensation of falling.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So many different sensations
we may experience.

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But we do not know
how to make sense of--

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you ever
travel in your astral body

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.050 align:middle line:90%
to escape reality?

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: No.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:10.450 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: You've never
tried to get away.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NANCI: But no.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Never with that intent.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But I can see how that happened
a few times, spontaneously

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:23.230 align:middle line:84%
because we sometimes
can have certain types

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.470 align:middle line:90%
of out-of-body experience.

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:25.940 align:middle line:90%
There are many types.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:31.610 align:middle line:84%
But we can have certain types
in which it's just being

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:35.010 align:middle line:90%
free of the breathing nonstop.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.500 align:middle line:90%
We are so used to it here.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:37.370 align:middle line:90%
We don't sense it.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But over there,
you don't breathe.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.030 align:middle line:90%
So it's silent.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.230 align:middle line:90%
And you are light.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:43.910 align:middle line:90%
And you think you act.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And you perceive things much
more clearer when we are lucid.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So it can be such an
amazing experience.

>>GEORGE: Like I told
you, when I was 11,

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:37.070 align:middle line:10%
I had my first out-of-body
experience and my only
