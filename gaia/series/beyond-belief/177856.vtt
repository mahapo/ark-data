00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.560 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: What you're
about to hear on "Beyond

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.340 align:middle line:10%
Belief" could shock you.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Emery Smith is with us.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.780 align:middle line:84%
He's a United States
veteran, spent many years

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.300 align:middle line:84%
with the United
States Air Force.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:84%
And he also did some
incredible things

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:84%
with covert operations,
which he'll talk about today.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, he's a regular
contributor to Gaia television.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Emery, welcome to the program.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It's good to have you.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>EMERY SMITH: Thanks
for having me, George.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What an amazing
career you've had.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever think
when you enlisted

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that you would be following
that path that you've taken?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.020 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, my whole goal
was to get into the Air Force

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:10%
and Fly F-15 Eagles and be the
whole pilot thing, you know?

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.940 align:middle line:10%
But I had a really big passion
for medical and biology.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:10%
So when I was taken all the
ASVAB tests and other tests

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:10%
that we could get into that
were not normal to take,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.350 align:middle line:10%
they kept bringing me back
to MacDill Air Force Base

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:10%
to do these tests
quarterly, they

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:10%
decided that it would be best
if you just took medical.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.661 align:middle line:10%
The Army offered me a
scholarship to fly helicopters.

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't want
to go in the Army.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:90%
My grandfather was in the Army.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:90%
My father was in the Navy.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was just wanting to
go Air Force all the way.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You wanted
to do your own thing.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So after really
considering everything,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I decided to go with
the medical program

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:84%
that the Air Force started
at that time, which involved

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
surgical technology,
emergency medicine,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
being a paramedic, the
really low-key stuff

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that you would see for
noncommissioned officers.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.671 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And took that venture.

00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it was
an interesting path.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.284 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever, ever expect
it to lead down the road

00:01:55.284 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:90%
that you've been going down?

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely not.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, after getting
stationed there,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I was over at Sheppard and,
of course, Wilford Hall there,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and then back to England
Air Force Base, Louisiana,

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
where I did my first little
stint with a air transportable

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
hospital, tactical air
command, where they flew A-10s.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And we were able
to deploy anywhere

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:84%
in the world in 48 hours
with two C-130s dropping off

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:90%
these hospitals.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was in right at the
time Desert Storm started.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So that was quite the adventure
of being associated with that.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But the neatest thing is right
after about a year being there,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:84%
they had that
major base closure.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.709 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they just
shipped me right to Kirtland.

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And everyone else actually
went south to Keesler.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had
a plan for you.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Something was
going on, obviously.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize that
till I got over there.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was already a
sergeant at that time

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.239 align:middle line:84%
in just months after being
enlisted, just a little bit

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:84%
over a year, which,
you know, is more

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
of a progressive
advancement they would do.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And here I am directly
in charge of all

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:84%
these surgical technicians
and surgical first assists,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
manning this 50-room
operating-room system

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:84%
we had at the veterans
hospital and also

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:84%
the active duty Kirtland
Air Force Base Hospital.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:84%
From there, I was offered
a moonlighting position

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.694 align:middle line:84%
from one of the
commanders there.

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
know, would you

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.002 align:middle line:84%
like to make some
extra cash, Smith?

00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, sure.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
well, we can put you

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.236 align:middle line:90%
in something in the evening.

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:27.516 align:middle line:84%
You can work doing some lab
work, just laboratory stuff.

00:03:27.516 --> 00:03:29.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Little did
you know, right?

00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:29.973 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Little, right.

00:03:29.973 --> 00:03:31.125 align:middle line:90%
Little did I know that--

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I really thought
I was just going

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.392 align:middle line:84%
to be harvesting organs from
fallen soldiers, is what I--

00:03:35.392 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:84%
because I'm an expert at
the body at that time.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:90%
And I could do that solo.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And the tissue, the first
couple pieces of tissue,

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.839 align:middle line:84%
I could tell it was
just not human tissue.

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Something off about the tissue.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not of this world, huh?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.845 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What they say,
tissue of unearth origin

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:90%
is what they told me.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you think it might
have been animal for a while?

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I did.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:54.630 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was some animals.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.338 align:middle line:84%
But they were doing
a lot of hybrid stuff

00:03:56.338 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
there at the genetic
programs that they had

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.430 align:middle line:90%
associated with the base there.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And I just have to
also let you know

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't Sandia Labs I
worked for or Los Alamos Labs.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:84%
They had a huge
underground facility there

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.903 align:middle line:84%
that many floors were rented
out by many different major

00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:90%
corporations.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And probably still?

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, yeah.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And the
thing is, why did they

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.260 align:middle line:90%
have to put it on a base?

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
It's because they need the
security of the military

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:90%
to protect them.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Very difficult
to get to that base.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Very difficult. You
have a base within a base.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.256 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:04:30.256 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And these bases are
also all connected underground

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:84%
in the facilities such as Area
51 and all the things you hear.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
It goes from there
to White Sands

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.574 align:middle line:84%
to the underground
tunnels and whatnot.

00:04:44.574 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what
point, Emery, did

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.440 align:middle line:84%
you start realizing
something's very strange here,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:90%
something is not adding up?

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you
have to understand

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
when you take these positions,
you get an upgraded security

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
clearance about every
three to four months

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.680 align:middle line:84%
if you keep your mouth shut and
you show up for work on time.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So I was really good
at that at that time.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Not today, but back then I was.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And here I was working
on these tissues and seeing--

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
it would come, just
a piece of tissue.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.236 align:middle line:84%
It might just look like
a muscle or an organ.

00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it on ice
or anything like that?

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:90%
These were very fresh.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And they might be usually
in a vacuum container,

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
steel with a special
clear glass top on it.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And you just turn a
dial, and it opens up.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're in an operating
room space suit kind of thing,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
not the ones we use in
orthopedic surgery, a lot more

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:90%
protective inside another--

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gloves.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.358 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, the whole thing.

00:05:40.358 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
It takes a person to help you
get dressed into this suit.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.022 align:middle line:84%
And you have your own
air supply and controls,

00:05:46.022 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
actually, the temperature
in the suit and everything.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So I just walk into
the operating room.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
It's all, like I said,
vacuumed in there.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's big
windows up on the top.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's the commanders
in there, the head scientist

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.239 align:middle line:84%
and other people
that are there that

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
can see all the different
operating rooms in that area.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.996 align:middle line:90%
So you're not alone.

00:06:04.996 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm alone
in the room, but not

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.745 align:middle line:84%
alone because
you're own speaker.

00:06:07.745 --> 00:06:08.870 align:middle line:90%
You can talk back and forth.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:90%
If you have a question--

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they watching you?

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, they are watching.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:90%
There's cameras in there, too.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
They're also monitoring
your heart rate.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.105 align:middle line:84%
They're monitoring
your body functions.

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Why would they monitor
your heart rate?

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you
know, some people,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
when they first start out,
it's the close confinement.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.460 align:middle line:90%
They might get claustrophobic.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.918 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
that's a good point.

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And when they slip you
another piece of tissue that

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
actually has a skin on it, like,
you asked me the first time,

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:90%
what--

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's kind of freaky.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.383 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's a little-- it was.

00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:90%
I saw this arm, you know?

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And this arm was blue
and had huge pores on it.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought maybe
it was just putrid.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.200 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe it was just
a rotting arm that shrunk up.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.409 align:middle line:90%
It was actually still--

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was the
arm of whatever--

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --very intact
of these long fingers

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:90%
and no fingernails.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Five fingers?

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, five fingers,
but had no fingernails.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And they do this,
though, George.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
They said 3% of all
the stuff I work on

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
are actually disinformation
stuff in case one day

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I do crack, and I tell the
public, this, this, and this.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.330 align:middle line:84%
It's going to sound
so far-fetched.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But I've done over
3,000 tissue specimens.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Not all of those are
full bodies, by the way.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And later on, with more
and more clearance,

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I got to go and use
examples of, like,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.079 align:middle line:84%
taking tissue and
going to the craft

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:90%
that they have from this being.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And taking tissue
samples from the craft.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what point,
Emery, did you realize,

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not looking at
human tissue here.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you finally
figured it out?

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.875 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Probably
pretty quickly.

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:42.274 align:middle line:90%
Probably in about eight months.

00:07:42.274 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is fast.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.648 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: First time
when I actually

00:07:44.648 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
saw, like, a full
finger and a hand,

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:52.250 align:middle line:84%
like I told you about, or
maybe a leg or a torso or torso

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
into a head, or
maybe just a head.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:90%
You know, it just depends.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And we were gathering
these organs

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.285 align:middle line:84%
and harvesting different
things, just like we would

00:07:59.285 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:90%
in a normal organ harvesting--

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, with Life
Flight One, who

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.289 align:middle line:84%
takes the harvesting
of people in accidents

00:08:06.289 --> 00:08:07.330 align:middle line:90%
and flies them somewhere.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you scared when
you started realizing what

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.060 align:middle line:90%
these tissues were?

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no, George.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:90%
I was more--

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd freak out.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:90%
I was the kind of guy that--

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I remember playing
soccer when I was 13.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And they took me
to the podiatrist

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:84%
to get my toenails taken
off because the shoes were

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:90%
too tight.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:90%
I had really big feet.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ouch.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So I was sitting
there and watching them

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.451 align:middle line:90%
numb it up and taking it out.

00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said, you
might want to sit down, son.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:90%
Turn away.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, no.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:90%
I want to see this.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wanted to see it.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you're used to that.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.720 align:middle line:84%
I was the guy that
liked to dissect

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
frogs, wanted to see what was
in there in school and stuff.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So this was very
intriguing to me.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.050 align:middle line:90%
It was actually addictive.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to go to work.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.578 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see what they
were going to give me next.

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But it was also frustrating
because I wasn't allowed

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:90%
to ask, where's this from?

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was
gonna ask you that.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what point did
you converse with these people

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:90%
and say, what is this?

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You could not, or
you would lose your job.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:84%
But the good thing is the
more clearance you got,

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.515 align:middle line:84%
then you got debriefed more
and more about this species.

00:09:07.515 --> 00:09:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, as you
went up the ladder.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.598 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: As you
went up the ladder,

00:09:10.598 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
you got to get access
to more anatomy

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and physiology of the
beings you were working on.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.907 align:middle line:84%
And especially when
I had to take samples

00:09:18.907 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:84%
from the craft and the
beings that were associated

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.952 align:middle line:84%
with that craft,
then they definitely

00:09:22.952 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:84%
brief you on the
craft and where it

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
was from, or where
they think it was from,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:90%
or where they acquired it.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these things actually
were acquired from space

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:90%
and then brought back down.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:84%
What, Emery, was their
mission with these specimens

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:90%
and these pieces of skin?

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I get that
question a lot.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And I believe they were
taking the genetics from this

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and using it for
pharmaceutical uses,

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:84%
using it for part of their
hybridization programs.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We were.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, we were meaning
the major corporations

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:84%
that run the world, not
the government so say.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
The political government,
they're all tied into this--

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:84%
political government, religion,
and the major corporations that

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:90%
run the world.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It's all this circular
craziness going on.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And were these
biological specimens as opposed

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.485 align:middle line:90%
to robots or things like that?

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There was some
cybernetic organisms, where

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.610 align:middle line:84%
it's like half tissue and
it does have some circuitry

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:90%
involved with them.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I know people, pop
culture term would

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
call that, like, a
program life-form

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:90%
or a cyborg-type being.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But I believe
they had consciousness.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.342 align:middle line:84%
I never worked on just a
robot, without any tissue.

00:10:32.342 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
All my stuff had
to do with tissue.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did they
harvest these specimens?

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how did they get them?

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's a good question,
too, because the first year,

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea where this
stuff was coming from.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I was very curious about that.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I've heard stories that maybe
they were growing these things.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were just going
out and taking these beings.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that most of them
were acquired either from craft

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that we shot down or craft
that we'd overtaken in space

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.180 align:middle line:90%
within our exo-atmosphere.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And maybe there
was some testing done.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We might have been
the aggressors in this thing?

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I believe in some
cases that could have happened.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe that
ETs would intentionally

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
crash their craft here to
give us some technology

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
to reverse engineer,
including their bodies,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
that may have been
clones, so we could

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:90%
learn about these species.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's a UFO
researcher, Paul Bennewitz,

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:84%
who investigates UFO
bases on the planet.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's look.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Paul Bennewitz was led to
believe that there was a secret

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.300 align:middle line:84%
underground base located
near Dulce, New Mexico.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:84%
He began flying there in his
plane to check out the area.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Eventually what happened was
they began to mess with him.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:10%
And some extraterrestrials,
a group of Gray

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrials that were
working with the military

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:10%
in the Dulce base, Bennewitz's
radio equipment had

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:10%
been able to intercept
the communications

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:10%
between the extraterrestrials
and the human operators

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.720 align:middle line:10%
in the base, in the
underground base.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So Dulce becomes a point
of focus for Bennewitz.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And he trains his
equipment there.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:10%
And he has some high-speed
photographic equipment there,

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:10%
And he's actually
able to photograph

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.980 align:middle line:10%
some of the ships,
some of the UFOs

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:10%
going into the mesa,
where you actually

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:10%
have a kind of vibrational
shift in some of the craft.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:10%
>> And the more he dug into
it, he found himself exposed

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.430 align:middle line:10%
to even more
nightmarish stories,

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:10%
many of them coming from Dulce.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:10%
For example, a lot
of these insiders,

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.620 align:middle line:10%
whistleblowers, if you
like, claimed to him

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:10%
that all sorts of
unspeakable experiments

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:10%
were being undertaken
in the Dulce Base.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:10%
People were being
used as Guinea pigs,

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:10%
if you like, in bizarre
genetic experiments,

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:10%
splicing alien and
human DNA together,

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:10%
and creating strange half
human, half alien creatures.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:10%
And reportedly, there
were hundreds and hundreds

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:10%
of people kept in the
Dulce Base in cages,

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:10%
the people who go missing
every year, that kind of thing.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of that, Emery?

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it real?

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, that is
real, unfortunately.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's scary.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Dulce is-- I
never was inside the base.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But I was at the
maglev stop there

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time at one
time going somewhere else.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And I did hear a
lot of these stories

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:84%
from some scientists,
some confirmation

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:84%
of people that were
very integris about what

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Later, I found out through
briefings and reports

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:41.260 align:middle line:84%
of working down under the bases,
underneath Kirtland and there--

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:84%
looking at some
of the briefings,

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.310 align:middle line:84%
as I was able to
get into the library

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:84%
after a certain
amount of years if I

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
had really good
credits and behavior,

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:90%
I was able to research this.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.002 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing a lot of
this, you know, abducting.

00:13:58.002 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, half a million
people go missing every year.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:90%
But no one talks about it.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, they are transients.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:84%
They're runaways and this
and that and the other.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But where is all
those people going?

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.190 align:middle line:90%
And why isn't it talked about?

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.435 align:middle line:84%
There's websites in the
United States of America

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:84%
that you just go to and
see all the missing people.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:90%
But no one--

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Hundred and hundreds.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Hundreds of thousands.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Gone, every year.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:90%
But no one says anything.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So that being said, I can
attest to the hybridization

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:84%
because some of the
extraterrestrials

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and some of the humans
that I've worked

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.800 align:middle line:84%
were-- were these
types of hybrid people.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And now, they don't look too
much different than we do.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
But they had larger skulls,
larger thought capacity,

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:90%
telecommunication--

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean telepathic
communication, telekinesis.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I do believe a lot of
that was happening from Dulce.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has caused you
to go public with this, Emery?

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I recently,
about six, seven years--

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:90%
more than that.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe eight years ago, I was
working on a zero-point energy

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Lab that I ran for
about five years.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was utilizing all
different types of scientists.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very costly
project, about $5 million

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:10.630 align:middle line:90%
a year, to run this.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, the patents
that was making so much money

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:90%
from was funding that.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I had also
investors scientists

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:84%
that were working there that
were all splitting the bill.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:90%
So it was really nice.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing all sorts of
amazing Tesla coils and energy

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and Bedini systems
and things like this.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:90%
And I had to get--

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
once I've lost all my income and
lost a lot of my corporations

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:84%
due to the government
getting involved

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.966 align:middle line:84%
in trying to coerce
my business partners--

00:15:42.966 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:84%
my business partners didn't
want to be associated with me

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.957 align:middle line:84%
because I was making
the movie "Sirius,"

00:15:47.957 --> 00:15:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
extraterrestrials.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And here I am, the president
of these corporations.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want it to
look like they were a kook.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
trying to play

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:56.334 align:middle line:90%
with your credibility, huh?

00:15:56.334 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I decided
to take the system.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
I had a zero-point energy system
that I needed to get validated

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:84%
because we had some interested
people that could possibly

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
take it public without
getting killed.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.195 align:middle line:84%
Because it has to go
to the right country

00:16:15.195 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:90%
or the right organization.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So from there, I
went to California.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little
classified laboratory

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.385 align:middle line:90%
up there near Topanga.

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And still
at this point,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.343 align:middle line:84%
you're pretty private
about everything

00:16:29.343 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:90%
that's been going on.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: With--

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.483 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The ETs and
things like that.

00:16:33.483 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, I'm leading
up to that, why I went--

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.696 align:middle line:84%
and so after eight
months of testing,

00:16:38.696 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:90%
I finally got it validated.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
There's only a few
laboratories that can actually

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.230 align:middle line:90%
validate this type of system.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:90%
And so it was validated.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was driving home with
the device in my Range Rover,

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.580 align:middle line:90%
with it in the back.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was hit in a head-on
collision in the mountains

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:90%
of Topanga at 55 miles an hour.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that's how
I knew things from then

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:84%
just started-- the
threats started coming.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They tried to kill you.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.670 align:middle line:84%
They definitely tried
to kill me, for sure.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just recently was in a
car accident, another collision

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.770 align:middle line:84%
where I was just sitting at
the light here in Boulder.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:20.006 align:middle line:84%
And 20 seconds later, this kid
hits me at 50 miles an hour.

00:17:20.006 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.089 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Just at a standstill.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:22.889 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:17:22.889 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You all right?

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I'm
still a little sore.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little sore?

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:90%
I would guess.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But I was
in the hospital

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:90%
just for a couple of days.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:90%
And I'm all right.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:29.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna be OK.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:84%
A little brain swelling
and some other things.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.954 align:middle line:90%
Had a bad concussion.

00:17:32.954 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So that being
said, because here I

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.430 align:middle line:84%
am with this system that's
validated that I can't just

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:90%
keep in my home.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.823 align:middle line:84%
It has to be on the
move all the time.

00:17:41.823 --> 00:17:44.200 align:middle line:84%
It has to be in different
secured locations, which

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting help for.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.410 align:middle line:90%
But it costs a lot of money.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:90%
And you know how that is.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So that being said,
I said, you know,

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:56.084 align:middle line:84%
it's time to go public because
this technology I have,

00:17:56.084 --> 00:17:57.250 align:middle line:90%
I just want to give it away.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But it has to
be the right people.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I've spent millions
and millions--

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who are going to be
able to do something with it,

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, that know how to
do something, not black-box it.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then
once I went public,

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.030 align:middle line:84%
it's starting to slow
down, all the threats.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not so bad.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think coming
forward and now

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:84%
having, like, a million
followers, it really

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
helps with the credentialing
and also with the public

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:90%
looking in on what's going on.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That may
have saved you.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I think it did.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Because if they kill me now,
I'll look like a martyr.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:27.960 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want that.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be harder
to clean up than anything.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.228 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then somebody's
got to explain it.

00:18:31.228 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.465 align:middle line:90%
Not saying--

00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they
were gonna do you in,

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:84%
they should have done
it a few years ago.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, as some of the white-hats
said to me, you're protected,

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
but you're not bulletproof,
which means get out of the way.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give me your
overall impression,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Emery, on what you
think is happening

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrial
presence on this planet

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.996 align:middle line:90%
and the hybridization program.

00:18:56.996 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
when you say that,

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:84%
are you talking about the
extraterrestrials that

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.990 align:middle line:84%
are just walking around
that we don't know about?

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Or are you talking about
the ones in the programs?

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The ones we know about.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:90%
The ones we know about.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The ones we know about.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I think they
don't have any intention

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.590 align:middle line:90%
of doing any harm.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I think they're here to study,
make sure that we don't blow up

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I think they're here to
help advance us consciously.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that ones that
have volunteered to be here

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:84%
are really volunteering to
be here to do something good.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.174 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, this is the
craziest place in the universe

00:19:28.174 --> 00:19:29.215 align:middle line:90%
right here, planet Earth.

00:19:29.215 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Probably is.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I mean,
it's the only place

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:84%
where people are cutting
each other's heads off left

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:90%
and right.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.008 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So they know
that we're not there yet.

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
But they're really compassionate
about it because we are them.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And they are from the future.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And they have Earth
human DNA in them.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:84%
I know this because we've
tested a lot of these bodies.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And they might be 80%
Arcturian, 10% Pleiadian--

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or maybe we're them.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's what I'm saying.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So it's like
they feel bad for us.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.020 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying is they're
compassionate because they

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:90%
were once here themselves.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the theories
of Zecharia Sitchin that

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:84%
go way back to the Annunaki
coming here, genetically

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.460 align:middle line:84%
altering us, doing all
this, I guess that makes

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:90%
a lot of sense, doesn't it?

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.600 align:middle line:84%
That it's very possible
that those things happened?

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't get into
a lot of books and movies

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:90%
and films and that thing.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it does seem
a lot of correlation

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.840 align:middle line:90%
of what's kind of happening.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:90%
So I do believe in that.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they want from us?

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think they
want us to succeed.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I think they want us
to clean up the planet.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.164 align:middle line:84%
I think they want us to preserve
life here-- the animals,

00:20:44.164 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:84%
whales, and all the
endangered species--

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:90%
before it's completely gone.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them have
come and have been

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:84%
seen collecting animal DNA
and plant DNA and human DNA,

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:90%
but not taking--

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:84%
you know what I'm saying--
complete bodies to do that,

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
but taking DNA and
putting it and storing it

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
in some sort of
universal library.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In case they
have to recreate it?

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, in case
they have to recreate it

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.650 align:middle line:84%
or reseed the Earth after
a major catastrophe.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's what
we do with a seed bank.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: We do the same thing.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.273 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:21:16.273 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the craft.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:84%
You apparently have had
some experience with it.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's lots of craft.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:28.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, I enjoy working
on very small craft.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:90%
I find them fascinating.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How small is small?

00:21:31.505 --> 00:21:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Small to
me, there are some

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that are as small as
an egg, and there's

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.079 align:middle line:90%
some as big as a freightliner.

00:21:38.079 --> 00:21:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Small as an egg?

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A craft?

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.917 align:middle line:84%
Well, they have
the ability, also,

00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:84%
when they're not in the 3D,
if they're transdimensional,

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:90%
to change shape.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And once they come
into 3D, sometimes they

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
have to hold their shape,
especially if they crash

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and the craft's
trying to heal itself.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: These
craft are actually

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.960 align:middle line:90%
made in space by sound.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.520 align:middle line:90%
So sound before form.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.227 align:middle line:90%
So with special sound waves--

00:22:00.227 --> 00:22:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they organic?

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.935 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --like a
lithotripsy machine--

00:22:02.935 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Yes they are grown and
they're made from sound.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And they are conscious.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I explained this
on a few other movies.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.630 align:middle line:84%
One of my first experiences
in one of these craft,

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.920 align:middle line:84%
where the craft kind of molds to
your body when you walk inside.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:90%
But there's no buttons.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:20.910 align:middle line:90%
There's no chairs.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:90%
There's-- nothing like that.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.704 align:middle line:90%
And it has this feeling--

00:22:24.704 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you have any pets.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:90%
But I'm a big dog lover.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.570 align:middle line:90%
And I have a dog--

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've had Labs before.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, OK.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So you have this joyful, fun
feeling when they're around,

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.320 align:middle line:84%
It lowers your anxiety
when you pet them.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And I got the same
feeling from this craft.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It actually was communicating
emotionally to me.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was very, very funny.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.362 align:middle line:90%
It had a very joyous feeling.

00:22:49.362 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The craft did?

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The craft did, yes.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you've
been in bigger ones.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.662 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:22:54.662 --> 00:22:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do those have
instrumentation to it?

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the level of
where the actual craft came from

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and the level of the species.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Are they a billion
years ahead of us?

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Are they 100,000
years ahead of us?

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So you might have an
industrial-looking craft that's

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:90%
only 100,000 years ahead of us.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you might have
these light craft

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that are physically
formed that you

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.180 align:middle line:90%
can see that can change shape.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.170 align:middle line:84%
But they could be as big as
the Empire State Building.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.776 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And these
are some of the craft

00:23:23.776 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
seeing when the polar ice

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:90%
caps melt in Antarctica.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Because that's happening
pretty quickly.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're there.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
They're under
there, aren't they?

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They're under
there, and they're

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.020 align:middle line:90%
starting to be exposed.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell
everyone, it's not me

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.500 align:middle line:84%
that's going to do disclosure,
or you, or the collective.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.510 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be Gaia.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Gaia, I mean Earth, because--

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Plus it could be Gaia,
this company, too.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.673 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It might be Gaia.

00:23:45.673 --> 00:23:46.960 align:middle line:90%
It could be Gaia.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It may be.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But as a
collective, we all

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:84%
have to put that
energy out there.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So everyone's kind
of part of it.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.517 align:middle line:84%
But Earth is the
main seed to do that.

00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
most beautiful thing.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Earlier, Emery, you
talked about 3,000 specimens

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:90%
that you worked on.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean we're talking
about 3,000 different species?

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, not necessarily.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:12.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand I might
do 13 specimens in one day,

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and those specimens all
came from the same sample,

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:16.010 align:middle line:90%
same being.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So that being
said, 3,000, I think,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.830 align:middle line:84%
got misinterpreted a while
ago when I said, well,

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:90%
I've done 3,000 specimens.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean all
3,000 different species.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:28.920 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean--

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.770 align:middle line:84%
There could only be 56
species for all we know.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right, exactly.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's good
to clarify that.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.800 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for asking that, too.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.416 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Any idea what they
physically look like in total?

00:24:42.416 --> 00:24:44.040 align:middle line:84%
'Cause you talked
about arms and legs--

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.998 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, they all
have the five-star type

00:24:45.998 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:84%
of programming, which means
two arms, two legs, and a head.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I can put this
when this question is asked--

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.270 align:middle line:90%
because there's so many--

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:84%
think of every creature
and plant on the planet.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about fish
and mammals and animals

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.230 align:middle line:90%
in Africa and South America.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Think about all of them a
billion, two billion years

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:84%
from now, turning into a more
higher conscious, intelligent

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.587 align:middle line:90%
life form.

00:25:17.587 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:90%
And this is what you're getting.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:84%
You're getting
beings that may have,

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.730 align:middle line:84%
like, a lion face, but have
a nice body, a regular--

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Looks like
the Sphinx, huh?

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, some of them do, yes.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, all the different
types of felines out there.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen a lot
of different cat beings.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And some are very small, only
10 inches off the ground.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But they're standing upright,
and they're very intelligent.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And some are,
like, 15 feet tall.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.546 align:middle line:90%
So there's many different sizes.

00:25:45.546 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of the largest
beings we worked on

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:90%
were about 33 feet tall.

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And these beings are highly
intelligent and no different

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.280 align:middle line:90%
than us.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.510 align:middle line:90%
But they're just larger.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And they come from
a different place

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:90%
that can sustain these bodies.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
you've gone public?

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad I've gone public,
not just because of fear

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.030 align:middle line:84%
of this not coming out,
but fear that my colleagues

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.760 align:middle line:84%
that I worked with
were going to just die

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:90%
holding this information.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:84%
I was the young
one of the bunch.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
like you are out there?

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: There's about a few--

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.614 align:middle line:84%
like, about 300 that I'm
aware of that are still alive.

00:26:27.614 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a lot.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:29.446 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's a lot.

00:26:29.446 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And since I've come out,
we have about five or six

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.100 align:middle line:90%
that are coming out.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And one is going to
be here next month,

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.530 align:middle line:90%
which was one of my instructors.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:90%
He's much older than I am.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:90%
And he's a great, great guy.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And he had to make this big
decision for his family,

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and they all do, to prepare
for this coming out.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful thing
because my goal was not

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.520 align:middle line:84%
only to come public
to protect myself.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:84%
But it was also to get people
to come out because there's so

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:84%
many clandestine scientists and
technicians and security people

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:90%
that they signed away--

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.870 align:middle line:90%
we had to sign stuff.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:13.984 align:middle line:90%
And it's scary.

00:27:13.984 --> 00:27:15.650 align:middle line:84%
There's bullets out
there with our names

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
on them if we start
talking like this.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, you've
got to be careful.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.138 align:middle line:90%
You have to be careful.

00:27:19.138 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But like you said, publicizing
it may have helped you,

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:90%
not hurt you.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm probably one of
the first credible ones

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:90%
to come out there.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm published in
major medical journals.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I have all my paperwork
from the military.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I have tons of letters of
recommendations from captains

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:90%
and colonels and whatnot.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I have all my active
duty paperwork.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I have actually on
that paperwork, which

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:41.900 align:middle line:84%
we're going to come
public soon with,

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.660 align:middle line:84%
it actually shows some of the
projects I was involved with,

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:90%
which was great.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that was a
mess-up on their end.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm excited that
that's coming out.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing other interviews
with people to vet me

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and things like that
to reassure everyone.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.290 align:middle line:84%
The good thing is I
already know a lot

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:03.770 align:middle line:84%
of the leaders of the conscious
movement, as you know,

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.930 align:middle line:84%
because I was vice president
of CSETI for eight years, seven

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:90%
or eight years.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.200 align:middle line:90%
You did a great job there, too.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Thank you.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.441 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
met you, actually,

00:28:11.441 --> 00:28:13.610 align:middle line:90%
through Greer a long time ago.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I got
credibility through them

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.640 align:middle line:84%
because I did the autopsy
on the Atacama being.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I just got published
as one of the authors

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.900 align:middle line:84%
from Stanford on that paper, as
you know, and things like that.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's not too
many other insiders

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:29.216 align:middle line:84%
that have any of
this type of backup

00:28:29.216 --> 00:28:30.590 align:middle line:84%
where your colleagues
are saying,

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:90%
yes, he is telling the truth.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we know and
have already vetted

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.494 align:middle line:84%
him through many organizations
around the world and so forth.

00:28:37.494 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do your
friends and family think

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
of this, of you, one,
going public, and then two,

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:90%
the things you're talking about?

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:50.839 align:middle line:84%
I've lost all my
family and friends.

00:28:50.839 --> 00:28:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because of this?

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sorry to hear that.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they
don't believe you?

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Most them were--

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
yeah, they were kind
of religious people

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that didn't believe
in what I was

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.930 align:middle line:90%
working with in the beginning.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.540 align:middle line:90%
And some were murdered.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.380 align:middle line:90%
And some died of weird ailments.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I was
alienated for this

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.420 align:middle line:84%
because of their
religious beliefs systems.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So my mother and father
have passed away--

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:90%
my mother recently, last year.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Her birthday is actually
on May 5, coming up.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And she was, as far
as I'm concerned,

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.720 align:middle line:90%
killed at a nursing home.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And other than that, I have
just a few colleagues around me

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.280 align:middle line:84%
that are giving me
the support that I

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.962 align:middle line:90%
need to keep moving forward.

00:29:46.962 --> 00:29:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
need that support.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You've got
to have the support.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it on my own.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And to see all the people, which
I was scared coming forward

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know if I
was going to be scrutinized

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.800 align:middle line:84%
or people were going
to come on board.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.830 align:middle line:10%
And thank goodness, I've already
had a history the last 10

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:10%
years of working in the
field with CSETI and things

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.870 align:middle line:10%
that I have a really
good following.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.800 align:middle line:10%
And people do know me and
can do a good character

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.660 align:middle line:10%
judgment of me.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.816 align:middle line:84%
And now, like I say, here I
am, three months into being

00:30:15.816 --> 00:30:17.190 align:middle line:84%
going on social
networking, which

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I've never done in my life.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And I have over a
million followers.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.171 align:middle line:84%
And these people are
really supportive.

00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:90%
They're writing letters.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, how
can we help you?

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.769 align:middle line:84%
We want to know
you're not alone.

00:30:28.769 --> 00:30:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Because that was my
biggest thing, is, man,

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.790 align:middle line:90%
this is the last straw.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.082 align:middle line:90%
And I'm gonna be alone forever.

00:30:33.082 --> 00:30:35.248 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are you gonna
do with this information

00:30:35.248 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:90%
that you have?

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what can you do with it?

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Well, I'm working
with government agencies

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.760 align:middle line:10%
and other corporations to
build a self-sustainable city.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.920 align:middle line:10%
And first, I'm starting
with regenerative medicine

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.720 align:middle line:10%
because that's my specialty.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:10%
And there's 500,000
veterans that

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:10%
die each year waiting
to be seen by the VA.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.715 align:middle line:84%
And about 40 veterans
a day commit suicide.

00:30:58.715 --> 00:30:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So there's
no reason for that.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.509 align:middle line:84%
It's just because they
don't have a place to go.

00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So I want to build a facility
and bring all of these people

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.840 align:middle line:90%
here first.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.597 align:middle line:84%
Because by doing
this, the government

00:31:10.597 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:90%
will approve that kind of thing.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will you tap into
your ET experience with that?

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I'm going to
tap into the actual devices

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.375 align:middle line:90%
that I am inventing.

00:31:19.375 --> 00:31:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Because of that technology?

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because
of that technology.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And invent these types of
things to help all of us.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And also, I have my
fingers in so many

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.130 align:middle line:90%
different medical areas--

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, vascular surgery and
plastic surgery and ENT surgery

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:90%
and open-heart surgery.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:41.487 align:middle line:90%
And I can go on forever.

00:31:41.487 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've invented many products
for all of these things,

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that we can bring it
to a space and not

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:49.700 align:middle line:84%
worry about the FDA or
big pharma ixnaying it

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.950 align:middle line:84%
because there's an
exchange being made.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's one for one
in a positive way.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:32:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These ETs that you
have done work with, have

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.060 align:middle line:90%
they physically contacted you?

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, have you talked to them?

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Do they interact with you?

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've guided
me from so long ago.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of my first
ET experiences were

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.287 align:middle line:84%
when I was seven and eight
years old on a farm down in--

00:32:17.287 --> 00:32:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you go
way back with them.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.780 align:middle line:90%
See, I've had many experiences.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I was very telepathic
with animals in my family.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:84%
My family was trying
to hush it down.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want people to know
that I had these experiences.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:90%
They have these experiences.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Little Emery's
dealing with extraterrestrials.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:35.030 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's not bring that up, right?

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Not a good thing to
bring up at the family picnic.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you that much.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.420 align:middle line:84%
What would you say is the
strangest cases of ETs you've

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.030 align:middle line:84%
dealt with in terms of
appearance, where they're from,

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:49.830 align:middle line:90%
what they do?

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There are some
that do look a little--

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, what I
tell everyone here

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.380 align:middle line:84%
is if we can't get along
with everyone here as far

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.966 align:middle line:84%
as racism and bigotry and our
skin color and the way we look,

00:33:01.966 --> 00:33:03.840 align:middle line:84%
you're gonna have a
really hard time doing it

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.756 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials
because not all of them

00:33:05.756 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:90%
look just like we do.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't, no.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You know, they
might have a larger

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.440 align:middle line:90%
mouth with fangs on it.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.630 align:middle line:84%
They might have big
tentacles coming out

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:90%
of them, like the ant people.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or the Grays, right?

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.129 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And the Grays are scary
just because of pop culture,

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:19.170 align:middle line:90%
all the movies out there.

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:23.665 align:middle line:84%
An evil extraterrestrial movie
put out every couple of months

00:33:23.665 --> 00:33:25.790 align:middle line:84%
because the government
supports that kind of thing.

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:28.260 align:middle line:90%
So I think that scares everyone.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't had too
many extraterrestrials

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:84%
except for one that was
very violent with me

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:90%
during my lifetime.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The one.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What was it like?

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, the one is us.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Us.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:90%
The planet of humans.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:90%
We're still evolving.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're still trying
to make things right.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's the race
probably that I was probably

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.440 align:middle line:90%
most uneasy about.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what my goal was,
was to bring everyone together

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and share the love that's
out there, not so much

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.820 align:middle line:90%
all the famine.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Let me teach you
how to fix the world

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.000 align:middle line:84%
so we can have fresh water
for everyone on the planet.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.340 align:middle line:84%
We can have shelter and food
for everyone on the planet.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.920 align:middle line:84%
The planet, George,
is not overpopulated,

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.850 align:middle line:90%
like everyone says.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.210 align:middle line:90%
This place can do a lot.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:24.620 align:middle line:84%
But we have to start taking care
of the planet and the animals

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:84%
on it, the ecosystems,
and then us to make it

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.510 align:middle line:84%
all synergistically
work together.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What planetary
systems are they from, Emery?

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:34.095 align:middle line:90%
Are they from--

00:34:34.095 --> 00:34:35.719 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Are you
talking about the one?

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:36.755 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The other ETs.

00:34:36.755 --> 00:34:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, the ETs.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Oh, my goodness.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.396 align:middle line:90%
They're from all over.

00:34:39.396 --> 00:34:43.580 align:middle line:84%
You can name any star system out
there, and it's full of life.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you know the
ones of Sirius and Pleiades,

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.179 align:middle line:84%
all the top ones
you hear about when

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.530 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at astronomy.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:55.054 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's these
systems, too, are very large.

00:34:55.054 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the universe
is teeming with ETs.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's teeming
with life everywhere.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's teeming with
life in between, which

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.230 align:middle line:90%
I've never talked about before.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.680 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
beings and bacteria

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of types
of animal-like creatures

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.560 align:middle line:90%
that can withstand space.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And we have some of
those here on the planet.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is the vacuum of space

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.820 align:middle line:90%
can support life somehow.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:22.168 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Just like down
in the Marianas Trench,

00:35:22.168 --> 00:35:24.870 align:middle line:84%
where we could never survive
that type of temperature--

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there are beings,
things, creatures down there.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:28.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's called chemogenesis.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's the
life from chemicals.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The ETs that you've
done some work with, would you

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.537 align:middle line:90%
consider them to be benevolent?

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you consider
them to be geniuses, I guess?

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:51.540 align:middle line:84%
I would definitely have
to say they're a lot more

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.830 align:middle line:90%
intelligent than we are.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:84%
They're a lot more
conscious than we are.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing I find
they're all in common

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.600 align:middle line:90%
is they all have personalities.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.780 align:middle line:84%
They definitely
have personalities.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They have humor?

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:06.144 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They have
lots of humor.

00:36:06.144 --> 00:36:07.750 align:middle line:90%
They're fun to be around.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.861 align:middle line:84%
And some of them might have
a look of this sad face.

00:36:10.861 --> 00:36:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we always look at
each other's face, you know?

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But maybe their subliminal
messages is not the same.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So an ET might have a
frown its whole life.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.530 align:middle line:84%
But he'll emit
this funny laughter

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:26.336 align:middle line:84%
through the way he communicates
or through emotion.

00:36:26.336 --> 00:36:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they
ever threatened you?

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Never.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Nuh-uh.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
deal with them,

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.080 align:middle line:90%
is it always on a military base?

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore?

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, not anymore.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.420 align:middle line:90%


00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:45.110 align:middle line:84%
They could be working, actually,
in other major corporations

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:49.690 align:middle line:84%
in kind of secluded,
secured areas, I'll say.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:53.565 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them do work in
the underground facilities.

00:36:53.565 --> 00:36:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I want to say facilities
because the facilities are

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:56.710 align:middle line:90%
located on the bases.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want people
associating, well,

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.730 align:middle line:84%
the Army is behind
this, or the military.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:01.814 align:middle line:90%
They're more the security.

00:37:01.814 --> 00:37:03.396 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
what's down there.

00:37:03.396 --> 00:37:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: When I'm told to go out
there and pick this person up,

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.826 align:middle line:90%
I'm not allowed to ask what--

00:37:09.826 --> 00:37:11.950 align:middle line:84%
my team's got to go out
there, pick this person up.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:12.920 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.720 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No questions.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.445 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --they don't know.

00:37:15.445 --> 00:37:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The military doesn't really know
until protocols are in force.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.520 align:middle line:84%
There are special
teams in the military

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:26.020 align:middle line:84%
for acquiring a down craft
and keeping the area secured

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.820 align:middle line:84%
using satellite technology
and also people on the ground

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.010 align:middle line:84%
to get out there, start
disinformation campaign.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:38.394 align:middle line:84%
So there is this group in the
military that can do this.

00:37:38.394 --> 00:37:39.310 align:middle line:90%
And they are the ones.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
clandestine ones

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.472 align:middle line:84%
that have their own, if
something crashes, to go out

00:37:44.472 --> 00:37:45.430 align:middle line:90%
there and pick them up.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's a couple
different factions

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:84%
that are involved with
this, depending on where

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:51.130 align:middle line:90%
on the planet this happens.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's also installed in all
the countries, not just here.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you think of
the alien abduction phenomenon?

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.050 align:middle line:90%
And is it real, in your opinion?

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it's
definitely happening.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that--

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.530 align:middle line:84%
what the people are describing,
it absolutely happened to them.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:12.070 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also aware of
the staged abductions

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.690 align:middle line:90%
that I know for a fact happen.

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Staged by?

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Staged by
the corporations.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: So let's say this--

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:23.520 align:middle line:84%
the car's going down a
highway, a desolate highway.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.707 align:middle line:90%
And it sees a bright light, OK?

00:38:25.707 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's people on the
ground that have already

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.020 align:middle line:90%
lit the gas off on the ground.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So when they drive through
it in this desolate area,

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:35.860 align:middle line:84%
they're already gonna get a
little wheezy and feel weird.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And all they've seen
is this bright light.

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:41.161 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
they're getting drugged.

00:38:41.161 --> 00:38:42.910 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
they're being drugged.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:45.370 align:middle line:84%
They might give them some
Versed or some other--

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:47.203 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why aren't
they doing this to them?

00:38:47.203 --> 00:38:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they're trying
to put the same thought

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.400 align:middle line:90%
into everyone's head.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the same abduction
they'll do here in Maine,

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.760 align:middle line:84%
they'll do the same thing
in Florida and Washington.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll jump
over to Hawaii, Japan,

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.330 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to Africa
and do the exact same thing.

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:05.830 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's always groggy.

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And these aren't
extraterrestrial abductions.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No, no.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: These are done by--

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: These are all
staged by these corporations

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:90%
and the government.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there
are ET abductions.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There
are ET abductions.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:19.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the
abductions are more

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:84%
designed to help someone
or to upgrade someone

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.110 align:middle line:84%
or to cure them of
something, or maybe

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:84%
if they got too
close to the craft,

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.320 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic field
there could actually knock

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:90%
them unconscious and kill them.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, that's right.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.312 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So they might
bring those people onboard

00:39:36.312 --> 00:39:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to fix them and
put them somewhere.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you don't think the
abductions are nefarious, evil,

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:42.130 align:middle line:90%
by any means.

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I
think all abductions

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.170 align:middle line:90%
are evil and nefarious.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would think so.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I believe all--

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No matter who does it.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No matter who does it.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- I'm telling you,
it's the major corporations

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and the government working
together to install

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.060 align:middle line:84%
a fear-based system
of extraterrestrials

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:59.240 align:middle line:84%
so, as Colonel Corso once said,
after the meteorite comes,

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.530 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have a
fake alien invasion.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And so these are the lines
of why is there an evil ET

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.980 align:middle line:90%
movie out every month?

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.980 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And I know the president of
the American Motion Picture

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Association.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to get a
documentary going right now

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.560 align:middle line:84%
to show my last
eight years of work

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.420 align:middle line:90%
bringing the people with us.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's going to be great.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the true
alien abduction phenomenon

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.610 align:middle line:90%
is happening.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they-- and
there's a hybridization program

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:33.310 align:middle line:90%
underway.

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, are
they making people

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.390 align:middle line:90%
to come back and take our place?

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Or are they taking them
to other planetary systems

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.530 align:middle line:90%
because they need them?

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:46.420 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
it's not so much--

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe it's so much--

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I think they're trying
to preserve our DNA,

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.150 align:middle line:84%
mixing it with their DNA
to preserve their life

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.325 align:middle line:90%
because they have become weak.

00:40:57.325 --> 00:41:00.970 align:middle line:84%
We are very strong
people because we

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.950 align:middle line:84%
can sit in front of
these cameras and lights

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:04.900 align:middle line:90%
and all of the EMF fields.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.610 align:middle line:90%
And we change over time.

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:07.690 align:middle line:90%
Our DNA gets stronger.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:09.190 align:middle line:90%
We live longer.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, our quality of
life is getting better here

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:12.670 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So they want to also
preserve all that.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:20.729 align:middle line:84%
And they have to do that by
having genetic samples of us,

00:41:20.729 --> 00:41:23.020 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't mean they need
my whole body, by the way.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They just
need a piece of hair.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:26.636 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:41:26.636 --> 00:41:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which you'd
freely give them, right?

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Which they can
go in any hair salon

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.986 align:middle line:84%
and take the trash from
the back, and there you go.

00:41:34.986 --> 00:41:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Barney
and Betty Hill case

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:40.810 align:middle line:84%
back in the '60s was one of the
dramatic alien abduction cases.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Does that come up anymore,
those kinds of cases?

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I don't see it often.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of abduction
scientists and people

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.270 align:middle line:90%
that went around the world.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:52.910 align:middle line:90%
And they did this huge study.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And the correlations are so
exact and precise because they

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.870 align:middle line:84%
staged the same exact one, so
it matches all the stories.

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:01.460 align:middle line:90%
This is what's going on.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
that real ETs,

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.564 align:middle line:84%
that they're not coming
down here and maybe once

00:42:07.564 --> 00:42:09.730 align:middle line:84%
in a while they're taking
someone or doing anything.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think it's
a malicious abduction

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.800 align:middle line:84%
that they're going
to take this person

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and dissect them or do
other weird sexual things.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It just-- high-conscious
beings don't watch pornography.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, I don't get
this whole other thing.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.870 align:middle line:84%
However, it's possible
that we have made a hybrid

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:36.232 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial that has the
monkey-like brain that we do--

00:42:36.232 --> 00:42:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We've made it.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.648 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That we've
made that could

00:42:38.648 --> 00:42:43.190 align:middle line:84%
go out and do this and acquire
alien reproduction vehicles

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and stage craft and things,
that they're doing it

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.290 align:middle line:84%
for their own self-worth,
which happens when

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:51.830 align:middle line:84%
sometimes these
projects go wrong

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.199 align:middle line:90%
and these specimens go wrong.

00:42:53.199 --> 00:42:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do these
ETs, Emery, believe

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.370 align:middle line:90%
in God or a higher power?

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There are
some that do have

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:02.610 align:middle line:84%
a religious type of background,
that believe in things.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of the
ones that I'm aware of

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:11.760 align:middle line:84%
don't have a one type
of God-type feeling.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I only know this because
of the briefings I've read.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.190 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't disinformation.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It came from the
underground facilities,

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.480 align:middle line:84%
from studying and
interrogating extraterrestrials

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.090 align:middle line:90%
that we have taken over.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
they know so much

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.840 align:middle line:84%
more now because
they got answered.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what would happen,
George, if we had actual--

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:37.080 align:middle line:90%
we have actual proof.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But if we really
showed the world what

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:42.710 align:middle line:84%
was on Mars and on the
moon and what was really

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:44.060 align:middle line:90%
underneath Antarctica?

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could we handle it?

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I think the history--

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.640 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Can we really release our ego
and stand in front of the world

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:53.900 align:middle line:90%
and say, hey, we were wrong.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And this religion did not exist.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.960 align:middle line:84%
This person-- I mean, I
believe in all the avatars.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And God, Jesus,
they all existed.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:03.720 align:middle line:90%
I do believe this.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.490 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that the
story's not finished.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of gaps
in that, in these stories.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would be,
Emery, the biggest revelation

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:16.460 align:middle line:84%
that you think you've
learned about these ETs

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.610 align:middle line:90%
that you didn't know before?

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, that we're
forever beings ourselves

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and that death is not
actually a negative thing

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.870 align:middle line:90%
because you can be reanimated.

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.190 align:middle line:90%
And you can be--

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they die?

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, yes.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.930 align:middle line:90%
The actual body can die.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.180 align:middle line:84%
But in the future, you live
for thousands of thousands

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.180 align:middle line:90%
of years, if you choose.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, you had
specimens of these creatures

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.020 align:middle line:90%
that you looked at.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.887 align:middle line:90%
Were they from dead ETs?

00:44:49.887 --> 00:44:50.720 align:middle line:90%
They must have been.

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.038 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:44:52.038 --> 00:44:54.980 align:middle line:84%
They could reanimate if they
were on their own planet.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:57.020 align:middle line:84%
They would have the
right technologies.

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:01.940 align:middle line:84%
We've seen stasis beings in
archaeological finds that

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.580 align:middle line:84%
were just kind of
in a dormant state,

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:07.250 align:middle line:84%
that they could do that
for as long as they want.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:11.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
have any concerns

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:16.120 align:middle line:90%
that these visitations are evil?

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Which visitations?

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of any of the ETs?

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, I
believe, like I said,

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:24.000 align:middle line:84%
that there might be
some hybridization that

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.740 align:middle line:84%
has gone wrong and has now
developed their own species.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.247 align:middle line:90%
And it could be very, very dark.

00:45:32.247 --> 00:45:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be dark.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.395 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:45:34.395 --> 00:45:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
not a good thing.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that can be
probably fixed or controlled

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.680 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't seem
concerned or scared.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Knowing what I'd
know, if I were you,

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:49.057 align:middle line:90%
I'd be shaking in my shoes.

00:45:49.057 --> 00:45:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, after you've
seen what I've seen, George,

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:55.480 align:middle line:84%
it takes a lot to get
me shaking in my shoes.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you have
made a conversion to you

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.380 align:middle line:84%
really want to find these
alternative energy sources.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
getting ET help on that?

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Or how are you developing this?

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: During the program,
and during the five years

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.750 align:middle line:84%
that the lab was
open, my scientists

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:15.690 align:middle line:84%
did have some
amazing experiences.

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And that being
said, it just means

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:22.380 align:middle line:84%
there were certain messages
that were not direct.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:27.750 align:middle line:84%
They were more indirect, as
far as one of our scientists

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.400 align:middle line:84%
had a bump in the
road on something.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.450 align:middle line:90%
And we couldn't figure it out.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, we
got back to the lab,

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and some instruments were laid
out that weren't there before.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who did it?

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:39.982 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:46:39.982 --> 00:46:41.190 align:middle line:90%
And we don't believe it was--

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A little
boost to help 'em?

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Right, a
boost to help them.

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I do believe there
is some indirect contact

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.924 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrials
that are helping us.

00:46:51.924 --> 00:46:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it could have been
an extraterrestrial that

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:55.830 align:middle line:84%
looked like a human and
broke in there and did it.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Very possible.

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That happens, right?

00:46:58.350 --> 00:46:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:46:59.775 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does happen.

00:46:59.775 --> 00:47:01.080 align:middle line:90%
It does happen.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We would
want free energy.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.690 align:middle line:84%
We would want an endless
supply of free energy

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:09.030 align:middle line:84%
if we were able
to tap into this.

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:12.480 align:middle line:84%
There are powers that
be on this planet that

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.520 align:middle line:90%
don't want that to happen.

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:19.530 align:middle line:84%
They make money selling oil and
electricity and natural gas.

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.230 align:middle line:90%
How do we combat that?

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:23.290 align:middle line:90%
How do you combat that?

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, I combat it.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And they visited me.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.842 align:middle line:84%
And they said, Smith,
what are you doing?

00:47:31.842 --> 00:47:33.050 align:middle line:90%
I told them what I was doing.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.560 align:middle line:84%
They already knew
what I was doing.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, don't
teach anyone about this.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you know,
don't hook it up to the grid,

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.919 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be OK.

00:47:42.919 --> 00:47:44.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, but once
you do that, look out.

00:47:44.835 --> 00:47:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So what are
you gonna do now?

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.020 align:middle line:90%
You got a working system.

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's not
what we wanted.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.370 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing is to, like--

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They did not
want you to succeed.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So the way I was able to
bring it out of the closet

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:57.060 align:middle line:90%
was I hooked up a battery to it.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.944 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
the Bedini system?

00:47:58.944 --> 00:48:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This is
a modified Bedini

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.720 align:middle line:90%
system, the third one he made.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the only
high-voltage Bedini system

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:05.310 align:middle line:90%
that I'm aware of.

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:08.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not the ones you
see on Amazon or on TV.

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:09.150 align:middle line:90%
This is a very--

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, please
check this out.

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here we go.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:12.612 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:48:12.612 --> 00:48:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>> What's going on over here?

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.125 align:middle line:84%
So look, this is
self oscillation.

00:48:16.125 --> 00:48:18.490 align:middle line:90%
So we've got a nice pulse train.

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.695 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was all yours?

00:48:19.695 --> 00:48:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So the pulse train
is self oscillation.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So the system is set
up so it's biased.

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So when it turns off, it
creates a reverse field,

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:33.030 align:middle line:84%
then turns back on and
creates the other side.

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:34.200 align:middle line:90%
And it goes back and forth.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a big
enough magnetic field,

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.130 align:middle line:90%
it means it can self oscillate.

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:40.370 align:middle line:90%
So it is self oscillating.

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:44.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's oscillating on
the trigger, which is cool.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But you can stop the
rotor and turn it off,

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and it'll still self
oscillate constantly.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So the rotor's just
spinning for no reason,

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:56.290 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, because the more
spikes you can get, the better.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But now you've
got some rotation.

00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.920 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, no
torque there, of course.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Almost 400 RPM.

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.020 align:middle line:90%
It's speeding up very slowly.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And I do have a bank
of resistors here.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.150 align:middle line:84%
These are all in
parallel just to get

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:13.370 align:middle line:84%
lower resistance, playing
with that, get it right.

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You developed that?

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.890 align:middle line:90%
I helped build that.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:17.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Bedini
brothers were the ones

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.840 align:middle line:84%
that we acquired it
from a long time ago.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And it was funny--

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:22.860 align:middle line:90%
not funny.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.280 align:middle line:84%
It was unfortunate
and actually horrific.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.380 align:middle line:84%
When we started to do
the validation on this

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.314 align:middle line:90%
just a few years ago--

00:49:29.314 --> 00:49:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it work?

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, it works great.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But we had come across
a couple of stumps.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
well, let's just

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:40.000 align:middle line:84%
call John up and see--
maybe he can say something.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.800 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't
get a hold of him.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So I was, well,
call his brother up.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And they called me and
said, uh, John died.

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
just call his brother.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, he died,
too at the exact same time.

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Come on.

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:55.060 align:middle line:90%
What are the odds of that?

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: At the exact same time.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:57.810 align:middle line:90%
And no one talks about this.

00:49:57.810 --> 00:49:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's like, why
don't people talk about this?

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They stepped over the lines
because they were selling--

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:07.330 align:middle line:84%
the way they teach
you how to do this,

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:09.640 align:middle line:84%
once we acquired
the main system,

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.630 align:middle line:84%
it's a very secret way
to look at the camera

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.730 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing a
YouTube video to help

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:17.260 align:middle line:90%
people learn how to make these.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't just
tell them how to make it.

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:21.140 align:middle line:90%
You have to figure it out.

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:25.221 align:middle line:84%
So with the help of this young
man and about 300 other, 350--

00:50:25.221 --> 00:50:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that why
his face was covered?

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:30.190 align:middle line:84%
We can't just-- you
know, we can't do that.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And 350 other people
wearing cameras

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.790 align:middle line:84%
as we're working on this system,
him and I, day and night,

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:39.070 align:middle line:84%
300 other scientists are
watching, helping us,

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.300 align:middle line:84%
talk to us, like,
don't cut that wire.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Solder this one.

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:42.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.129 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: So it's a collective.

00:50:44.129 --> 00:50:46.140 align:middle line:90%
So I can't say it to myself.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And since I started this program
10 years ago with my five

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:53.140 align:middle line:84%
scientists, and then had
to come get it validated

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.480 align:middle line:84%
using the world's
300 scientists,

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.420 align:middle line:84%
it was a beautiful thing to
know that we accomplished it.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.516 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you
utilize this technology?

00:51:00.516 --> 00:51:02.515 align:middle line:84%
Would you hook it up to
your house individually?

00:51:02.515 --> 00:51:03.190 align:middle line:90%
How would it work?

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:05.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the best way to do it--

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:06.820 align:middle line:90%
I hate to give away the secrets.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:07.500 align:middle line:90%
But I'm doing this--

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.583 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, give it away.

00:51:08.583 --> 00:51:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --because
I want to say it

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:12.370 align:middle line:84%
so other scientists
out there know

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.620 align:middle line:90%
this is how you get around it.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:17.530 align:middle line:84%
You can hook up a small
battery to this device

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:19.210 align:middle line:90%
and get it rolling.

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:22.687 align:middle line:84%
And then that one battery will
charge these 10 batteries here.

00:51:22.687 --> 00:51:24.520 align:middle line:84%
These 10 batteries can
go into a capacitor--

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.360 align:middle line:90%
the energy, 300,000 volts.

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you could put
different things on there

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.060 align:middle line:90%
to run different things.

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this what you
call zero-point energy?

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:37.390 align:middle line:84%
It can do zero-point energy, but
we're not going to claim that.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:40.360 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to
claim is one battery

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.990 align:middle line:90%
will charge unlimited batteries.

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Now, how do
you want to use that?

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Same thing that solar does.

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.670 align:middle line:84%
It goes into battery banks and
capacitors and these windmills

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:50.470 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
market that machine?

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, we're not.

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:53.970 align:middle line:90%
This is what I need help with.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I've got a
big group right now

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:57.490 align:middle line:84%
in Europe that's
conscious enough

00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:59.420 align:middle line:90%
to take it to the next level.

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.914 align:middle line:84%
So we're very
excited about this.

00:52:01.914 --> 00:52:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm basically
just giving this away.

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I've already put too much
time and money into it.

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I need a group of
really conscious investors

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to make sure it gets
in the right hands.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:14.352 align:middle line:84%
Because you can offer me a
billion dollars tomorrow.

00:52:14.352 --> 00:52:15.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm not giving it away.

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:16.670 align:middle line:90%
And people know this about me.

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I've often been offered
hundreds of hundreds

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.890 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of
dollars for the system.

00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But I cannot take money
that has blood on it.

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.000 align:middle line:90%
I cannot take dirty money.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The people have to know they
can't make money off this.

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.627 align:middle line:84%
They have to invest in it and
get it out in the right way.

00:52:30.627 --> 00:52:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I thought one time I was just
going to fly over to China

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.210 align:middle line:90%
and push it off the thing.

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And these guys would just grab
it, make a million of them,

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.582 align:middle line:90%
like they did my stem cell one.

00:52:38.582 --> 00:52:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Realistically,
when do you think

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:43.210 align:middle line:90%
you can get this to the market?

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I'm hoping to
get it within a few months

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.660 align:middle line:90%
in the right hands.

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big is it?

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's about 450 pounds.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:51.540 align:middle line:90%
It's about three by three feet.

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:53.575 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:52:53.575 --> 00:52:55.720 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't obviously
carry it around with you.

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.170 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:57.753 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, just
think about this--

00:52:57.753 --> 00:52:59.920 align:middle line:90%
many people have Tesla cars.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And if I have one
Tesla car battery,

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:05.861 align:middle line:84%
I can charge 10
Tesla car batteries.

00:53:05.861 --> 00:53:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little
bit of a savings

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:10.450 align:middle line:84%
there, all from
one small battery.

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did this technology
come to you by ET technology?

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.220 align:middle line:90%
How did you get it?

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, no.

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.560 align:middle line:84%
The Bedini brothers
we're working

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.400 align:middle line:84%
on many different
things clandestinely

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.080 align:middle line:90%
for the longest time.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was introduced to them
by some other people that

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.970 align:middle line:90%
were in these types of fields.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:30.902 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to invest in
it and get something going.

00:53:30.902 --> 00:53:31.860 align:middle line:90%
And I stumbled upon it.

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this is
unrelated to your ET work.

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, it's not related
to the ET work whatsoever.

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:37.288 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
I always wanted

00:53:37.288 --> 00:53:40.480 align:middle line:84%
to do because I can't stand gas,
coal, and oil as far as cars

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and the pollution
and all that stuff.

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:43.970 align:middle line:90%
And I'm hoping someday--

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:45.553 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You may
save the environment.

00:53:45.553 --> 00:53:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well,
that's the whole--

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:48.250 align:middle line:90%
this is why it's here.

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:49.291 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the plan.

00:53:49.291 --> 00:53:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You can't
charge a car up--

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:52.486 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
keep saying Tesla.

00:53:52.486 --> 00:53:57.016 align:middle line:84%
You can't charge an electric car
up and tell me that came from--

00:53:57.016 --> 00:53:58.300 align:middle line:90%
where'd that energy come from?

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.640 align:middle line:84%
It came from gas, coal, or
oil, from plugging it in.

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, exactly.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:03.116 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So these
people-- it's actually

00:54:03.116 --> 00:54:05.050 align:middle line:84%
costing more energy
to the environment

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:06.410 align:middle line:90%
by using electric cars.

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would
this device work,

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.470 align:middle line:84%
if you can not
give us specifics,

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:13.733 align:middle line:90%
but how does it work?

00:54:13.733 --> 00:54:16.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Oh, well, I'm not
going to go into that for sure.

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:17.560 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of patented, isn't it?

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, it's kind of--

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.475 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trademarked.

00:54:19.475 --> 00:54:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We're
not-- that's going

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:24.100 align:middle line:84%
to be something everyone's
going to learn gradually.

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to
get into that, for sure.

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can these devices be
used to physically heal people?

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Because the energy
that comes off these--

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:39.730 align:middle line:84%
you know, one of the
tests we did a while back

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:42.920 align:middle line:84%
is there's five or six
scientists that wanted

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.450 align:middle line:90%
to actually see it operational.

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:46.247 align:middle line:84%
And you can't just go
and carry this around

00:54:46.247 --> 00:54:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and turn it on anywhere
because it sends off

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.340 align:middle line:90%
an energy signature.

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And the satellites are
going to pick it up,

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
know where it's at.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So we had it in a
van moving around.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And we went to a small village
somewhere in the United States

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.520 align:middle line:90%
where the Walmart closes early.

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where would
that be, right?

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, no.

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:06.230 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we did
was we pulled up.

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.310 align:middle line:90%
And scientists were there.

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And we pulled it out,
laid it on the ground.

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And this was without
the batteries.

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said, everyone shut
off your cell phones.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Everyone laid around the device.

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:20.690 align:middle line:90%
And we turned it on.

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:22.754 align:middle line:84%
And all the cell phones
turned on by themselves.

00:55:22.754 --> 00:55:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And all the lights came
on in the parking lot.

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And we picked it
up, put it back in the van.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:30.787 align:middle line:84%
And then he drove off with
the device and everyone left.

00:55:30.787 --> 00:55:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And I had a buddy up on
the hill about a mile away

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.460 align:middle line:90%
with a high-powered camera.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.506 align:middle line:84%
And within three minutes,
the black SUVs were there.

00:55:37.506 --> 00:55:38.630 align:middle line:90%
People were looking around.

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:39.512 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That fast?

00:55:39.512 --> 00:55:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Three minutes.

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking,
man, they must have

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:45.760 align:middle line:90%
these agents in every city.

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Waiting.

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Waiting.

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:48.900 align:middle line:84%
You know how much
money that would cost?

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot.

00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:53.692 align:middle line:84%
How close is this, Emery,
to Tesla technology?

00:55:53.692 --> 00:55:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, we have
a Tesla coil, too.

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And it is that type of
energy that it emits.

00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:59.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's drawing it
out of the universe, right?

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's drawing it from
the zero-point space, correct.

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's here right now.

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.646 align:middle line:90%
It's just this is how--

00:56:07.646 --> 00:56:09.020 align:middle line:84%
you guys can look
this up online.

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows already
what zero-point energy is.

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.350 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm getting
at is Tesla energy

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:18.270 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit different
because it shoots

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:22.760 align:middle line:84%
these ionic waves out of
the device, which basically

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:27.230 align:middle line:84%
go through your body and
destroy negative ionic particles

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:29.180 align:middle line:84%
in your body, which
are mostly what?

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Viruses, bacteria, and cancers.

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So we do
have a small unit.

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:36.685 align:middle line:84%
And I won't say the name
of the guy who invented it.

00:56:36.685 --> 00:56:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How small is small?

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It stands
about 24 inches tall.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It has about a
12-inch footprint.

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And I am going to
bring that into here--

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I was just talking to some
of the members of Gaia--

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.760 align:middle line:90%
to treat about 30 people.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And it does shoot
off this amazing--

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:55.484 align:middle line:84%
we're reproducing lightning
is what's going on.

00:56:55.484 --> 00:56:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I keep
thinking of "Star Trek."

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And
remember the doctor?

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:03.017 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You know, would wave
this little wand over people

00:57:03.017 --> 00:57:03.850 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds
like you're getting

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:06.110 align:middle line:84%
close to that kind
of technology.

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, that's
a frequency technology.

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And we do have that.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.594 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
things I'm upset about,

00:57:10.594 --> 00:57:12.480 align:middle line:90%
that this technology exists.

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:15.095 align:middle line:84%
Some of the backscattered
radar technologies that we have

00:57:15.095 --> 00:57:18.770 align:middle line:84%
have been shrunken down
into an iPhone size.

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So you can literally put
this on your chest, OK?

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And just like we
zoom in on a picture,

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.540 align:middle line:84%
it's 400 greater times
sharper than a CAT scan.

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:33.290 align:middle line:84%
You can zoom in to the
fat cell and look at it

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:34.350 align:middle line:90%
and run a little program.

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:36.371 align:middle line:84%
It'll say, these three
cells are cancerous.

00:57:36.371 --> 00:57:37.370 align:middle line:90%
They're about to mutate.

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's kill 'em.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And all's you
do is push one button.

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.160 align:middle line:90%
The frequency goes in.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:45.130 align:middle line:84%
You could revolutionize medicine
and everything else with this.

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That's
what I'm gonna do.

00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Realistically,
how long?

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well--

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you had your way.

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You got to
get-- it's already here.

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:54.610 align:middle line:90%
We already know how to build it.

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.735 align:middle line:90%
We already have prototypes.

00:57:55.735 --> 00:57:59.310 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we have to
work with the governments

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and the agencies to do it
because you just don't--

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and we have to make
sure that it can't

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:09.750 align:middle line:90%
be used for something bad.

00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:13.170 align:middle line:84%
These things are
very amazing devices.

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But they also can be turned
around to do other things.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, I look
at the world, too.

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And even though we
have all of this,

00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and I want to push,
push, push, it's like,

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.480 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe we're just not
ready for that just yet.

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not on my timeline.

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's on the
universal timeline

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:30.630 align:middle line:84%
of when we're
capable of releasing

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:35.669 align:middle line:84%
this stuff when we are not so
aggressive with each other.

00:58:35.669 --> 00:58:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
these men in black, Emery,

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:41.140 align:middle line:84%
who show up whenever
you test this thing.

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Are they military?

00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Governmental?

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: No.

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:44.674 align:middle line:90%
No, they're all government.

00:58:44.674 --> 00:58:46.127 align:middle line:90%
Government, not military.

00:58:46.127 --> 00:58:47.460 align:middle line:90%
I've never had military show up.

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of suits show
up from big pharma and FDA

00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and things like that wondering
am I going to release this?

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.030 align:middle line:90%
What do you think you're doing?

00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the big electric,
gas, coal, and oil very

00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:05.130 align:middle line:84%
rarely now pays me a visit
because I haven't done anything

00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:05.930 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:08.340 align:middle line:84%
They're worried now
that I'm coming out.

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all these
threats have been so serious.

00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:13.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like it
escalated the threats,

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:15.910 align:middle line:84%
but now it's kind
of on a down slope.

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to do anything
without everyone's permission.

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:20.684 align:middle line:84%
You know, you don't
just grab something--

00:59:20.684 --> 00:59:22.350 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
do it the right way.

00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:25.830 align:middle line:84%
You have to have it tested
over and over and over.

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And you have to put
devices on the device

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:31.950 align:middle line:84%
so people can't utilize
that for something bad.

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:35.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to teletransport
a bomb to the White House.

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:36.720 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm saying.

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.710 align:middle line:84%
This is horrible
to think like this.

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:39.654 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good technology
sometimes turned bad.

00:59:39.654 --> 00:59:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:43.110 align:middle line:10%
But there's other
ways to dumb it down

00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:46.972 align:middle line:10%
and to have it work on
an way that you're not

00:59:46.972 --> 00:59:48.180 align:middle line:10%
going be able to hurt anyone.

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I need the
help of many more scientists

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:53.700 align:middle line:84%
to come onboard with us with
these new endeavors to say,

00:59:53.700 --> 01:00:01.020 align:middle line:84%
hey, there are ways that we
can make this sizable in a way

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that it couldn't
be used for that.

01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:07.170 align:middle line:10%
I already will give
all my stuff away.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:10.200 align:middle line:10%
I want some large, conscious
group of scientists

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.680 align:middle line:10%
to take this off my hands.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.480 align:middle line:10%
I just want it--

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.850 align:middle line:10%
I already did all the leg work.

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:16.666 align:middle line:90%
I've already proven it works.

01:00:16.666 --> 01:00:18.040 align:middle line:84%
I've already done
all this stuff.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm just reaching out
because I'm just one guy now

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.026 align:middle line:90%
with pretty much nothing.

01:00:22.026 --> 01:00:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well just
don't give up.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.790 align:middle line:90%
You can't give up.

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:25.830 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.404 align:middle line:84%
It's not how many times
you get knocked down.

01:00:28.404 --> 01:00:30.320 align:middle line:84%
It's how many times you
get up and keep going.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.514 align:middle line:90%
Sylvester Stallone.

01:00:31.514 --> 01:00:32.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: "Rocky."

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I love that,
when he says that.

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:35.386 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great phrase.

01:00:35.386 --> 01:00:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to thank you
for doing what you're doing,

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Emery, and also,
more importantly,

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:43.230 align:middle line:84%
the sacrifices that
you have given in order

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:44.550 align:middle line:90%
to get to where we are.

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, thank you
for having me, George.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Appreciate it.

01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:48.412 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And you'll be
seeing a lot more of me.

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You know what?

01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Put me on the list as
one of these devices.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to be one of
the first to get one.

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, I'll
have no energy costs.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.430 align:middle line:90%
You never know, right?

01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:59.929 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: No, that's
the whole thing.

01:00:59.929 --> 01:01:04.020 align:middle line:84%
We're addicted to paying
this mogul here every day

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.260 align:middle line:84%
to keep us doing this so
we have to keep working.

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.509 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's got to change.

01:01:07.509 --> 01:01:09.810 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
