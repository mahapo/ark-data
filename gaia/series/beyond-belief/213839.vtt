>> GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.460 align:middle line:10%
Daníel Colón is with us, a
conscious content creator

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:10%
and multidisciplinary
artist whose work dives deep

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:10%
into astrology, tarot,
the law of attraction,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:10%
and the journey of
spiritual awakening.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.340 align:middle line:84%
He's also exploring the
synergy between spirituality,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:84%
creativity, and the
transformative power

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelics.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:84%
What a character
resume you have.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
My god, where did you
get all those titles?

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:10%
>> DANÍEL COLÓN: I
mean, you know, I--

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:10%
it's interesting anytime I
have to introduce myself.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:10%
It's hard for me to
just pick one thing.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I love the self in many ways
in which we can tap into self.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.617 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, thank you.

00:01:03.617 --> 00:01:04.700 align:middle line:90%
That was quite a mouthful.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:90%
You just had to deliver that.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Absolutely.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Daníel, did you learn all of
this in your homeland of Puerto

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:90%
Rico?

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: No-- well, I've
learned some of it in Puerto

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Rico.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.210 align:middle line:10%
It's definitely cultural
in so many ways.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.930 align:middle line:10%
Growing up, watching
Walter Mercado

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.630 align:middle line:10%
on television, who
is an astrologer, so

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:10%
famous in the Latino culture.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And seeing him
cuddled up in front

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:84%
of my TV ready to learn
about my horoscope definitely

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
had profound impact
in my spiritual life

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
myself as a creator.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.255 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, a lot
of this deep dive

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:39.380 align:middle line:84%
really happened in New York
City when I lived there

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:90%
for like 10 years.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: What happened?

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: I was there for 10
years and it happened right

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.857 align:middle line:84%
after I actually totaled
my car completely.

00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Florida at the
time when that happened.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it was a
pretty major car accident.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I was at a moment in my
life where I really didn't

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:90%
know what I wanted to do.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:84%
I called up my brother who
lived in New York City.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
He said, come on
over, just try it out.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:90%
And I stayed there for 10 years.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the most
transformative experiences

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Being in a city with
so many cultures,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:84%
so many beliefs,
so many practices.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And it really laid
the foundation

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of who I am today.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is that where you
had your spiritual awakening?

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: There are so many
spiritual awakenings in my life

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:90%
and anybody's life.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
There's not one pinnacle
moment, I think.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I think we're always in
the process of awakening,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:84%
but definitely some major
moments in New York City,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:84%
including the pandemic,
which so many of us

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
experienced some amazing
contrast during that time.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:84%
It was such a moment
of transformation.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It almost changed
the face of the planet.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: I mean, it has.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.873 align:middle line:84%
It still is transforming
the face of this planet

00:02:50.873 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and definitely transforming the
way in which we connect with one

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
another and our values and
how we support ourselves

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:90%
through that.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I remember going to a
local restaurant in Saint Louis

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and they wouldn't
let anybody inside.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So in December,
January of 2020, we're

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
sitting outside with heaters
on and nobody around.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.550 align:middle line:84%
There was no
connection with people.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: It was horrible.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:90%
But for me, it was just--

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:90%
it was a blessing.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.008 align:middle line:84%
They told me to stay inside
and I was like, cool,

00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to stay inside.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do the work.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sit with
myself and explore

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:84%
what it is that I actually
want to do in this life.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Before that, I was
managing restaurants,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to become
an actor, I had an agent.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And none of that was
really working for me.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So I took that sign
from the universe,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and I said, well, what
can I do with this moment?

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:84%
How can I create
opportunity from this?

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm sitting, having
a conversation with you.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's like something worked.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You tied in
spirituality, creativity,

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:90%
psychedelics.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:90%
How do all those three mix?

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Well, during my
experience in the pandemic,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I was alone and I was engaging
on some solo trips where I was

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:84%
sitting with myself, sitting
with some of those pain points

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:90%
that I had.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
mushroom medicine,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic medicine is
inherently spiritual because it

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:22.832 align:middle line:90%
connects you to yourself.

00:04:22.832 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You're
talking about mushrooms?

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Yeah, mostly
mushrooms for me.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I love the earth.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And if it comes from the
earth and it's medicinal,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm like all about it.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
maternal about mushrooms,

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I think, connects us
to our love centers.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
It connects us to empathy and
it connects us to ourselves.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.223 align:middle line:84%
And that connection, that to
me is what spirituality is.

00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Does it make
you more creative, too?

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Absolutely.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
If you're open to it, if that's
what you want to use it for.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
There's something very freeing
about psychedelic medicine.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I remember my first
ever mushroom ceremony,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:84%
which was like 12
years ago, I finally

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
gave myself permission to
create and be a creator,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:90%
to just make mistakes.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
I had a canvas in front of me
and I started doodling on it.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And four hours later,
there was what I thought

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:90%
was a masterpiece from it.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And there was no voice
of judgment telling me

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I should paint this
way or paint that way.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Mistakes arose, and
I dealt with them

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:90%
lovingly and compassionately.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And that freedom in the
creative process, I think,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.602 align:middle line:84%
is something that
we need right now.

00:05:34.602 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How do you know what
kind of mushrooms to ingest?

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.855 align:middle line:84%
Because it's dangerous if
you're doing the wrong thing.

00:05:40.855 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Absolutely.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing the wrong
thing, it can be dangerous.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Test your substances, for sure.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:84%
If you're engaging
with it, know where

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.348 align:middle line:84%
you're getting it from, sourcing
it from the right place.

00:05:52.348 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Are they legal?

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.307 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: They're not.

00:05:54.307 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:90%
They're not legal.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Oh.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Wait a minute, Daníel.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: I'm not telling
you go do it on your own,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be changed forever.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I will say, although
it's not legal right now,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:84%
the stigma behind it is
definitely changing here

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:90%
It is legalized in Canada.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of places
abroad that you can

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:90%
take these substances legally.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But I'm optimistic
about the United States

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and how this is going to
change the culture here.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it's not legal
at your own risk for sure.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Having it in your possession,
there could be a problem there.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Be aware
of that, folks.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Be aware of that.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Absolutely.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Do your research on--

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: But what
about your health?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Can it hurt you?

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: There's been lots
of studies about psychedelics,

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually helping
so many people with PTSD,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.110 align:middle line:90%
anxiety disorders, depression.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the research
out there is amazing.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So I consider it to
be a safe practice

so long as you're
taking care of yourself,

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
you're in the right set
and setting in your mind,

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:90%
in your environment.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't recommend
engaging with this stuff

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.260 align:middle line:84%
in some chaotic
environments, for sure.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Consult your doctor,
know where you're at,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.272 align:middle line:84%
know how you feel,
and do your research.

00:07:24.272 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Do your research,
do your research.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.760 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the biggest
things with psychedelics.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Do your research.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You made a small
video clip that went viral about

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.420 align:middle line:84%
the intensity of the
spiritual experience.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at it.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Grab my hand.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Grab my hand.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:10%
Now, we wait.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
We wait for that, but
now, now, now we go.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Keep holding my hand.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Keep holding my hand.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Keep moving.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Keep your feet--
why is your hand--

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What was
that all about?

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: My goodness.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It's so crazy.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:90%
That feels like so long ago.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
But it was the
first viral moment--

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Was that you?

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: That was me.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:90%
That was absolutely me.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
That was happening
during a time where

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
we hear about
spiritual awakening

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and even spirituality
in general,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds like this super
transcendent space to be in.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's great, it is.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:84%
My idea of spirituality and
the way I like to practice it

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:84%
is to bring it down
into the earth.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring the stuff in the
clouds down into the earth.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's some really
challenging parts

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:90%
of a spiritual awakening.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:90%
There is growing pains with it.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
We're facing
generational traumas--

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Were
you on mushrooms--

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: No, no.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't really take
mushrooms that much anymore.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't really engage
with the medicine as much,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.670 align:middle line:90%
and it's here and there.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, I create from a
place that I don't really

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:84%
need the mushrooms to tell me
what to create or how to create.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It's reconnected me to
my creative potential.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But that video,
it was an attempt

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
of me bringing light to the
spiritual awakening process.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Who were
you trying to talk to?

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Myself.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Myself.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.560 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to just laugh at
myself and all the absurdities

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.652 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Not the spirit world?

00:09:17.652 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: No, not
the spirit world.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Putting it out on
the internet, it's

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.710 align:middle line:84%
basically talking to a
spirit world of some sort.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I shared
it with the world.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the world ended up
relating to it, which was great.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:84%
I love bringing humor
and fun and play

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:90%
to the spiritual experience.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:90%
I think it's very important.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:90%
It's needed.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a sacredness to
it, but there's also play.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, you
made another video,

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:84%
not quite like the first one,
about following some creative

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.915 align:middle line:84%
impulses and how it puts you
into a very spiritual alignment.

00:09:49.915 --> 00:09:50.715 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Some mornings you wake up and
you just got to paint a wall.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.010 align:middle line:10%
And not for any reason in
particular, other than there's

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:10%
this creative impulse
to paint a wall.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why I'm
doing this right now,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:10%
but I felt like I was called to.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And these creative
impulses, if we follow them,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
lead to one thing and another,
and another, and another,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:90%
and boom, now we're vibrating.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in alignment with
our creative potential.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:10%
And this is the catalyst.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle line:90%
These are the sparks.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:10%
Inspiration is just this
beautiful, disembodied power

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.362 align:middle line:10%
that if we ignore
it, it just goes

00:10:32.362 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:10%
to the next host and the
next host and the next host,

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:10%
and you slowly crumble into
your, I could have done this,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:10%
I should have done this,
why didn't I do this?

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:84%
All you got to do is do it,
and then watch what happens.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:84%
This is by no
means finished yet,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.770 align:middle line:84%
but it's fun to
document the process.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.418 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, here's how
it looks finished.

00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:54.352 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:54.352 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It looks
like a massive Picasso.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: I love it.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Good job.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Yeah, I mean, all
my paintings, really, it's--

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I just make a random line, and
from it, I'll extract something.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.430 align:middle line:90%
I love making mistakes.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Or, as Bob Ross calls
happy accidents.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:34.307 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is just the
epitome of there's an impulse.

00:11:34.307 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:90%
I want to paint something.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
follow the rules.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to paint the
wall like everybody else paints

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:90%
their wall.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Why not doodle on this and
why not break the rules.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
creativity is to me.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:90%
It's really wonderful.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:90%
It's innovative and it's fun.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I had a great time
painting that one.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How many hits do you
get on social with something

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: I mean, social media
is an interesting space to be

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.780 align:middle line:84%
in because some things
land, some things don't.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Some things get pushed up in
the algorithm, some things--

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to really
determine how people view it.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I create for me and
I create for me.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And I put it in the world
and you happen to like it,

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:90%
you happen to not.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You dabble with
astrology and tarot, don't you?

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yes, I do.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Tell me what you
like about both of those.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: They're amazing
tools to get to know yourself

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and to get to know
the world around you.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a tool for self-inquiry.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Astrology came into
my life at a moment

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.070 align:middle line:84%
where I really
didn't know myself.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking for
something outside of the Bible,

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.778 align:middle line:84%
outside of mainstream religion,
to really ground and--

00:12:42.778 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You needed something.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.910 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: I needed something.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:90%
I needed some language.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many ways
to get to know yourself,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's astrology,
there's human design,

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:84%
there's the Pottermore,
Harry Potter test.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're a Gryffindor,
Ravenclaw, whatever it is.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.820 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of ways to
get to know yourself.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Astrology is one of
those, I love the stars.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
The stars are so
beautiful to me.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of brings the
cosmic into the ground.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful tool kit to get
to know yourself in the world.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY:
Astrologically speaking,

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.650 align:middle line:84%
someone like me who is a
Gemini, what does that tell you?

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Well, Gemini energy,
Gemini is the young Air sign.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.770 align:middle line:84%
They're very great
at conversation.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why having a show
like yours, it really tracks.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And they thrive on
those connections.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:84%
They bring light to
conversation as well.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a very private
side to the Gemini energy

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that's not out and
about in the world.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.235 align:middle line:90%
There is a headspace.

00:13:46.235 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:84%
There's another conversation
happening in the head,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.850 align:middle line:84%
in the mind that
maybe a lot of people

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:90%
don't necessarily know about.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.333 align:middle line:84%
So Geminis are typically seen
as being like two people.

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Some people say
they're two-faced.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, no, I'm
not going to tap

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.035 align:middle line:84%
into that toxic
astrological rhetoric.

00:14:04.035 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: No, no,
no, you're not.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: But yeah,
Gemini energy has--

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:84%
they can adapt to a
space in beautiful ways.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
They know how to read a room
and tap into it in a way

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.800 align:middle line:84%
that they still feel
authentic within that space.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And for some people, that's
scary because they're like,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I see you in this
space and you're

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:84%
a little different, in this
space you're a little different.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, you're just
adapting, you're just vibing.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: That's a good point.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, where does
tarot fit into this?

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: So tarot is
all about storytelling.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.390 align:middle line:90%
It's been around for centuries.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:90%
It's been around for a while.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And tarot is basically
taking a lot of the Carl Jung

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:51.820 align:middle line:84%
archetypal language and
bringing it into cards.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And with those cards, you pull
them out, and you look at them,

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and you can tell a story
about your experience.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:84%
You can tell a story about
somebody else's experience,

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and there's some universal
truths in the cards.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I like to use them basically
as like a journaling prompt.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Who pulls the cards?

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:84%
You, Daníel, as the
reader, or the person

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:90%
who's getting the reading?

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: I typically
pull the cards myself.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Like there's always a
grounding practice where

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:90%
we just sit and we ground.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:84%
We connect energetically
to one another,

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll just
entrust the universe

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.050 align:middle line:84%
to allow whatever cards are
meant to pop out to pop out.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.990 align:middle line:90%
And from that, we tell a story.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it's a
great story indeed.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:90%
It's jam packed with wisdom.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Each of the cards, they
exemplify a specific moment

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.230 align:middle line:90%
in the spiritual experience.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.923 align:middle line:84%
And I think we can pull a lot
of meaning from those symbols.

00:15:50.923 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What do you recommend
for people who want to use

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.512 align:middle line:84%
astrology or tarot for
their daily guidance?

00:15:57.512 --> 00:15:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Well, if you're going
to go with the tarot route,

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I would recommend just
pulling a card a day.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.670 align:middle line:84%
That's how I really
started years ago.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Just like pulling a random
card every single day,

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.130 align:middle line:84%
meditating on it,
journaling about it,

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and really just
seeing what the card

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
has to say about your
own personal experience.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
If you're curious
about astrology,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.560 align:middle line:90%
start low and go slow.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of astrological
wisdom out there.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:84%
You're way more
than just a Gemini.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:90%
You also have a rising sign.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:90%
You also have a moon sign.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.940 align:middle line:90%
You also have a mercury sign.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:84%
There's also houses in the
astrological system as well.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
information out there.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
If you're really wanting to
just start off in astrology,

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:84%
know your rising sign, know your
sun sign, know your moon sign,

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.580 align:middle line:90%
and start there.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:84%
From there, you can expand your
knowledge a little bit more.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I'm amazed you're
not into numerology, too.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Numerology
is a whole other force.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you know your
life path number?

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: 7.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:56.775 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: You're a 7?

00:16:56.775 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm 4.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm 4.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So really all about creating
the structure, the four walls.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I was born
on a 4, by the way.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a lucky number for me.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Hey, that's great.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:90%
That's really, really great.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: June 4.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: June 4.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.250 align:middle line:84%
For April 17 over
here, so I do have a 4.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Super.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about the
law of attraction?

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Where does that fit into this?

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.577 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Law of attraction
is where it's at.

00:17:18.577 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And what is
the law of attraction?

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.077 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: What is the
law of attraction?

00:17:22.077 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:84%
The law of attraction
is a universal law.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you look up the universal
laws, there's many of them,

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Law of attraction
is just one of them.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:84%
There's "The Kybalion," which
is a beautiful book that has all

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:90%
the laws put in there.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But law of attraction
is basically the idea

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:84%
that we're creating reality with
our thoughts, with our feelings.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:84%
We're creating reality
through our actions,

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:90%
through our impulses.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you tap into the
vibration of that intentionally,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
you can become a masterful
creator of your own reality.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And law of attraction
really came into my life

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.250 align:middle line:84%
when I was really looking to
radically shift it from the one

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:90%
that I was living in.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Well, we have proof
of a video that you made about

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.810 align:middle line:84%
the law of attraction that went
viral again on social media

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.480 align:middle line:84%
using the audio
of Abraham-Hicks.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So when people say,
what are you doing?

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:90%
You say, things that please me.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.990 align:middle line:10%
And they say, toward what end?

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:10%
And you say, pleasure.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:10%
And they say, but really,
what are you working on?

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:10%
And you say, having a good time.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:10%
And I say, but what do
you hope to accomplish?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.940 align:middle line:10%
And you say, living
happily ever after.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.000 align:middle line:10%
And they say, but what do you
want to leave as your legacy.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.860 align:middle line:10%
And you say, I was a happy one.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:10%
And they say, but what is the
mark that you want to leave?

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:10%
Life is joyous.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.140 align:middle line:10%
But what is the value that
you see in contributing

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:10%
to this time-space reality?

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:45.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm joyful.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.500 align:middle line:10%
But what do you
hope to accomplish?

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.530 align:middle line:10%
Being happy.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:10%
It's hard for people to wrap
their thoughts around that,

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:10%
and yet that's what all of
existence is about, you see.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I can see how
you have a following.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: How so?

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It's intriguing.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.062 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You're very creative.

00:19:03.062 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Absolutely.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as a queer
person, growing up

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
around lip-syncing
and drag queens,

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:84%
there's something very radical
about drag queens and the song

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:84%
choices that they bring to
life through lip-syncing.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So I thought of like, I'm like a
spiritual drag queen, basically.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll bring some real deep
wisdom, and that's entertaining,

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully you chew on it
and you get something from it.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What does the law of
attraction mean to your life?

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: There's
responsibility.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.030 align:middle line:84%
We have a responsibility
here in the way

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:90%
that we show up in this world.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we show up in
this world has consequences.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.720 align:middle line:84%
They can have positive
consequences or negative ones.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:10%
So if you're trying
to embody and create

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:10%
a life where you're just
happy and you're just enjoying

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:10%
yourself, why wait
for things to come

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:10%
to you to enjoy and be happy?

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.750 align:middle line:10%
If you already are in the
vibration of happiness

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:59.650 align:middle line:10%
and enjoyment, you will attract
more happiness and enjoyment.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's all about
responsibility and power

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and accountability
in that and play.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that negative
things will happen,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:84%
negative things will
show up in your life,

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.800 align:middle line:84%
but you have so much power
in the way you transmute

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
that energy into
something beautiful,

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:84%
into something pleasurable, into
whatever it is that you desire.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It looks like the
creating of your artwork that we

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.220 align:middle line:84%
saw in the previous
video changed your life.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What has
it done to you?

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: It's given me freedom.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:37.880 align:middle line:84%
It's given me freedom to
explore, to be a creative being.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:90%
We're all creative beings.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of us
is a creative being.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And many of us, we get
out of the school system

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and we forget about
our imagination.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:90%
We forget to play.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's given me
this space of like, wow,

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I can literally
do whatever I want

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and I can enjoy myself
and be successful at it.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:84%
All that really matters
is that I enjoy myself.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So the freedom of
just creative thinking

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and innovative
thinking, that to me

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:84%
is way more exciting than
playing into the status quo,

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
playing into those
systems that they

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.800 align:middle line:90%
felt very constricting to me.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There are big
astrological events, Daníel.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:84%
One of them is Pluto
moving into Aquarius.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Oh my gosh.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Pluto in Aquarius is
definitely going to be

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and already is one of
those transits that's

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.590 align:middle line:84%
going to rock our
world and really change

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
the landscape of how we
connect to one another.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How so?

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: So in order for us
to really dive deep into this,

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:84%
we must understand what
Pluto means symbolically.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:84%
So Pluto is the planet of death
and rebirth and transformation.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is a sign that's
all about innovation.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.670 align:middle line:84%
They're the humanitarian
of the zodiac.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:84%
They're all about
looking on the outside

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and looking in and
creating structures,

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.150 align:middle line:90%
innovating structures.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So when the planet of
rebirth and transformation

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.610 align:middle line:84%
enters the sign of
innovation, which is Aquarius,

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:12.890 align:middle line:84%
it's going to create some
tension, some friction.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing
in the world already,

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:84%
like we're already
kind of seeing we're--

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Too much.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Exactly.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's war,
there's bloodshed.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a very contrasty
world right now.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And one could look at Pluto
and Aquarius and be scared.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:90%
There's change.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It's imminent and
change is necessary.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.360 align:middle line:84%
But I look at this moment
and I can't help but think,

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:84%
this is going to be one of
the most innovative time

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:41.767 align:middle line:90%
periods of our lives.

00:22:41.767 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: How long will it last.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: So we're looking at
this transit lasting until 2044.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:90%
So we got a few decades of this.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to bring
us closer to one another.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It's going to create
collective liberation.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:84%
That's what this transit is all
about, collective liberation,

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.130 align:middle line:90%
communal love.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a lot of the themes
from the Civil Rights movement

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:84%
coming into play, which
if you know of "Hair"

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and "The Dawning of the Age of
Aquarius," that whole song like,

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.570 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we're reconnecting
to something here.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to see like,
hold on, what are these systems?

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Are they actually supporting us?

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.383 align:middle line:84%
And how can we innovatively
create new systems

00:23:22.383 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that support the collective
in a way where they feel

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:84%
nurtured, held,
loved, and cared for?

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: 2044, ironically, is
the next major solar eclipse.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Oh my gosh.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How does
that fit into this?

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: I mean, eclipses
are all about the shadow.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Eclipses are all about unveiling
those hidden truths that we may

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:90%
tuck away in boxes and corners.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's time for
us to confront those demons.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of all of
this, I think, for me,

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
is when we confront
these demons,

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:84%
we can recognize those
demons in other people.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And the empathy
that that brings.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.430 align:middle line:84%
That to me is love
and accepting.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, hold on, why are we
really fighting each other?

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.150 align:middle line:90%
My demons are your demons.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.530 align:middle line:90%
We share the same anger.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:90%
We share the same grief.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:90%
We share the same traumas.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Why are we fighting each other?

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.025 align:middle line:84%
Why are we doing this
to one another here?

00:24:18.025 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: It's the song,
"The Dawning of Aquarius,"

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.900 align:middle line:90%
was in the '70s.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yes.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Is it still here
or is this coming back?

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: It's coming back.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.380 align:middle line:84%
If you look up "The
Age of Aquarius,"

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.740 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard to
determine an actual date.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Even if you were
to hear the song,

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:41.690 align:middle line:84%
"when the moon is in the seventh
house and Jupiter aligns with

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Mars," like that's not really
what the Age of Aquarius is.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Age of Aquarius is an energy.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Age of Aquarius is a feeling.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's not an actual
moment in time.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But considering that Pluto in
Aquarius is happening right now,

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
it's a really major
transit, I would say.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Like, yeah, right
now it really does

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:90%
feel like the Age of Aquarius.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.530 align:middle line:84%
This really does feel
like an innovative time.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: It keeps dawning.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.785 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: It keeps dawning.

00:25:06.785 --> 00:25:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It will never end, I
think, until we finally

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.150 align:middle line:84%
realize, wow, loving each
other, caring for one another.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.760 align:middle line:84%
That type of love is very
special and important.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: How does
consciousness fit into this?

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: In what way?

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: I mean, does
it apply to any of this?

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN:
Consciousness, I mean--

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.775 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Does it affect it?

00:25:28.775 --> 00:25:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Absolutely.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.840 align:middle line:84%
The collective consciousness is
going to be affected by this.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.587 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we brought this
time period on ourselves,

00:25:36.587 --> 00:25:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's one of the
beautiful things about law

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:84%
of attraction, is that
thoughts create reality.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Emotion creates reality.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:48.178 align:middle line:84%
And before the pandemic, so
many of the conversations I

00:25:48.178 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:84%
was having with friends of
like-- it was disappointment

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
of like, wow, it's like
such a struggle right now,

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.463 align:middle line:84%
and what are we really
doing with our lives?

00:25:54.463 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:90%
What are we really working for?

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And through those
moments in which

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.570 align:middle line:84%
we're explaining what we
don't want in this world,

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:84%
the universe is literally
bringing the challenges,

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.710 align:middle line:84%
the obstacles that
we have to get over

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.240 align:middle line:84%
in order for us to actually
attain what we do want.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So we are contributing to
the collective consciousness.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.870 align:middle line:84%
It will-- what we experience
with Pluto in Aquarius

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.020 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a
consciousness shift coming

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:84%
from Pluto in Capricorn, which
is all about protection of self

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:90%
and protection of one's values.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's time
to really dissolve

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:90%
those values a bit more.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius dissolves
those boundaries,

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:84%
dissolves those values so that
we can create a planet where

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:90%
we can live as one.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You did a little
channeling about a song about

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:84%
the revolution that
Pluto in Aquarius brings.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.412 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah.

00:26:40.412 --> 00:26:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> If I were a rich man, I'd
give it all to the world.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:55.440 align:middle line:84%
If I were a poor man, I'd
raise every boy and girl.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Heal me once.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Heal me twice.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Cross my spirit.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:01.956 align:middle line:90%
Hope to die.

00:27:01.956 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:84%
If I were a soldier, I'd
lay all my weapons down.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:24.550 align:middle line:84%
If I were the people, I'd
thread shiny flower crowns.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Claim our blood, give back land,
watch in silence, hand in hand.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Revolution.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:43.922 align:middle line:90%
Revolution.

00:27:43.922 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Revolution.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.350 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.232 align:middle line:90%
Revolution.

00:27:51.232 --> 00:27:54.390 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Revolution.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:28:08.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And the thousand,
thousand, thousand,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:84%
thousand tiny little lives, and
the rich folk getting richer,

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:23.240 align:middle line:90%
taking pictures of their lives.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:84%
We may never really know
until it's over, till we die.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth is
standing, watching,

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:90%
stifling her bitter cry.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.774 align:middle line:90%
She sings revolution.

00:28:38.774 --> 00:28:41.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:42.534 align:middle line:90%
Revolution.

00:28:42.534 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Revolution.

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Revolution.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:29:07.240 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:84%
If I were a rich man, I'd
give it all to the world.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:21.700 align:middle line:84%
If I were a poor man, I'd
raise every boy and girl.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:90%
Heal me once.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Heal me twice.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Cross my spirit.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.393 align:middle line:90%
Hope to die.

00:29:28.393 --> 00:29:37.062 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.062 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You ever thought about
going on "America's Got Talent."

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.492 align:middle line:90%


00:29:42.492 --> 00:29:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: I don't know.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:90%
I'd be down.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Sure, America's Got
Talent, what's up?

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.856 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You might win.

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Oh my gosh.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.750 align:middle line:90%
That is Pluto in Aquarius.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:84%
That is the Pluto
in Aquarius energy,

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.270 align:middle line:90%
like we're all feeling it.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:01.960 align:middle line:84%
We're all feeling it,
like it's time for change.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, change has to
come with some of these darker

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.720 align:middle line:90%
aspects.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:84%
But from the ashes, we will
rebuild again and again

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's been consciousness.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:90%
That is consciousness.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And how much does
astrology play in that role?

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Astrology plays
a role in that as much

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.930 align:middle line:84%
as you're willing to let
astrology influence it,

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.880 align:middle line:90%
as long as you're willing--

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.900 align:middle line:84%
whatever you give
astrology to, it can--

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I choose to see astrology
as like, cool, awesome.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to strap on my boots
and I'm going to do the work.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Whether that happens
consciously or unconsciously,

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:42.190 align:middle line:84%
it's really all
dependent on you.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.020 align:middle line:84%
This change is going to
happen in one way or another.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
I think astrology, it
gives me hope and at least

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.570 align:middle line:84%
an awareness about it,
versus not really being aware

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:56.350 align:middle line:84%
of the energetic implications
of what's happening in the world

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:57.670 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Instead of looking at the news
and being so like triggered

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.490 align:middle line:84%
by it, I can look to astrology
and I can be like, cool,

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.580 align:middle line:84%
there's something
cosmic happening here.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a collective
shift happening here.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And I can choose to be an
innovator with this energy,

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.860 align:middle line:84%
or I can continue
beating myself up

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:90%
because I don't know what to do.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.440 align:middle line:90%
I choose to do something.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's literally the
foundation of color me crazy,

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.700 align:middle line:90%
color we crazy, from me to we.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.970 align:middle line:84%
It starts from the self and it
ripples out into the collective,

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:90%
it ripples out to all of us.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can astrology
help make you escape?

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Absolutely.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Astrology, on the flip side,
can also be a scapegoat.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.390 align:middle line:84%
We see it with mercury
retrograde, for instance.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is like, gosh, mercury
retrograde, I can't do it.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, no,
astrology is not an excuse.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.140 align:middle line:90%
Astrology is not a crutch.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.780 align:middle line:84%
It ultimately is
a system of wisdom

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:90%
for you to claim your power.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a source to really
feel good about oneself.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And I welcome mercury
retrograde now.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.515 align:middle line:90%
I'm not like dreading it at all.

00:32:10.515 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like, great.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:12.765 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me
I get to pause,

00:32:12.765 --> 00:32:16.490 align:middle line:84%
reflect, review, and really
take my time in communicating?

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Not a problem.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Not a problem.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.330 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me I need to
practice my patience right now.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:21.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what we need to
do right now, Astrology?

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Not a problem.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.100 align:middle line:84%
But people can
escape into astrology

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and it can be used
in a dogmatic way.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there are probably
some astrologers out there who

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:90%
look at Pluto and Aquarius.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.230 align:middle line:84%
They're like, these
are the end of times.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.622 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, these are
the end of something.

00:32:38.622 --> 00:32:39.830 align:middle line:90%
This is the end of something.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And it's also
the beginning of something.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Absolutely.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:90%
There it is right there.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's the
beginning of so much.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:51.660 align:middle line:84%
It's an excitingly
transformational time

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.110 align:middle line:90%
to be alive right now.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I was younger
and I would learn about

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:84%
the '60s movement and what
was happening during that era,

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I was like, that looks so
challenging but how it brought

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.590 align:middle line:90%
people together, it inspired me.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening literally
right here, right now.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Live.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.348 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah, in the flesh.

00:33:11.348 --> 00:33:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: What's the future of
spirituality in terms of where

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:14.690 align:middle line:90%
it's going?

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.290 align:middle line:90%


00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.123 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Who knows?

00:33:18.123 --> 00:33:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking forward
to spirituality

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.870 align:middle line:84%
that is definitely more
grounded, more in the earth.

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.720 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of spirituality that

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:84%
is very connected to the
ethereal space, and I'm like,

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm all for it.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:38.290 align:middle line:84%
How you choose to practice your
spirituality, it's amazing.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.090 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's something happening
right here, right now in the 3D.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And the 3D is what helps us
connect to the 4D, the 5D,

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.020 align:middle line:90%
to all of it.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking forward
to a spirituality that's

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.810 align:middle line:84%
more grounded, more connected,
and these connections

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:90%
with you and I.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants
to astral project.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to
connect to spirit guides.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, that's
amazing and all.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.330 align:middle line:84%
But you're missing
everything else.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You're missing what you
came into this world for.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.560 align:middle line:84%
You came for this
experience, we all did.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.670 align:middle line:84%
We asked for this,
human experience.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.940 align:middle line:90%
And this is the gift.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I like to call myself an Earth
tour guide, just like, let's

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:17.739 align:middle line:90%
be here now.

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's enjoy what we have
of this Earth because we're

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.350 align:middle line:90%
seeing she's crying.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:90%
She's crying out to us.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important for
us to connect back with her.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Have you
ever tried ayahuasca?

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:30.989 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: I haven't
tried ayahuasca.

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm afraid
of it or anything.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.969 align:middle line:84%
When it presents
itself to me, sure.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:39.030 align:middle line:84%
If I feel aligned
with it, great.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics are
a beautiful tool,

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.397 align:middle line:84%
but one could escape with
psychedelics as well.

00:34:44.397 --> 00:34:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: You may not come back.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:47.063 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: You may not come back.

00:34:47.063 --> 00:34:48.929 align:middle line:90%
You can have a psychotic break.

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:54.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people make super
crazy, impulsive life decisions

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.037 align:middle line:84%
from psychedelic experiences
that cause a lot of--

00:34:57.037 --> 00:34:57.995 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: So why do it?

00:34:57.995 --> 00:35:02.090 align:middle line:90%


00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: I think people who
engage with psychedelics are

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.140 align:middle line:90%
willing to take the risk.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I think what's lacking with
the psychedelic space is--

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.890 align:middle line:84%
are these conversations of
like, hey, let's integrate this.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Just because the
medicine showed you this,

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.480 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't mean that it is--

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.880 align:middle line:84%
there is still a
hallucinogen-- it's still

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.640 align:middle line:84%
a hallucinogen. So like,
let's really digest and see

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.230 align:middle line:90%
what this really means.

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I think, right now, people
do it because they're

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.780 align:middle line:90%
looking for something deeper.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.940 align:middle line:90%
They're looking for something--

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.020 align:middle line:84%
they've tried SSRIs,
they've tried therapy,

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.670 align:middle line:84%
they've tried the
traditional way,

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and they're looking
for rocket fuel.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And psychedelics could
absolutely be rocket fuel.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.970 align:middle line:84%
To which I say, tread
carefully, know your dose.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Dosage is everything.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to be
taking heroic doses.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Start with a mild dose,
start with the micro dose,

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.675 align:middle line:84%
start with functional
mushrooms--

00:35:57.675 --> 00:35:58.717 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Or none at all.

00:35:58.717 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Or none at all, yeah.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can do all of
this work without it.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:07.850 align:middle line:84%
If you have the right community,
if you have the right thing

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.240 align:middle line:84%
to believe in,
because ultimately,

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.950 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics can connect
us to meaning, again,

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.430 align:middle line:90%
in a very deep way.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking with a friend,
a neighbor of mine who is just

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.130 align:middle line:84%
so amazing, and he threw this
out into the conversation

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and he was like, we're
experiencing a meaning crisis

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.310 align:middle line:90%
in life right now.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:90%
People are looking for meaning.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.060 align:middle line:84%
People are not as connected to
religion as they were before.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.352 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
something to believe in,

00:36:35.352 --> 00:36:36.810 align:middle line:84%
if you have something
to believe in

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.270 align:middle line:84%
that really resonates with
you, and that can be astrology,

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.770 align:middle line:84%
that can be tarot, all
of this information

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:44.040 align:middle line:84%
you can get from these
other spiritual tools, that

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.850 align:middle line:90%
can be breathwork.

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Breathwork is an amazing
transformational tool as well.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't need psychedelics,
but it's coming back.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a psychedelic
resurgence for sure.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try my best
to have harm reduction

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.690 align:middle line:84%
conversations with people
who ask me about it.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.750 align:middle line:90%
There are risks.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Definitely know what
you're getting into

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and the environment
that you do it in,

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.010 align:middle line:84%
the people who you do
it with, the support

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.430 align:middle line:90%
that you have afterwards.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where do
you hope this leads?

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: I hope this all
leads to a happier, healthier,

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:90%
more connected humanity.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I hope it leads to a space in
which we can look at each other

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and see ourselves in
one another again.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And also, a world in which
we're connected to the Earth.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:40.250 align:middle line:84%
We're connected to creativity,
and not just consumption,

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:90%
and that freedom.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that freedom,
it starts with the self

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:90%
and it comes from the self.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the systems.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's not in the structures.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It's in ourselves.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And liberation
starts from within.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm
looking forward to.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Daníel, where does
consciousness fit in with

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.630 align:middle line:90%
creation?

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Gosh,
creativity, consciousness.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, they're
one of the same.

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.020 align:middle line:90%
We've all had ideas.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.880 align:middle line:90%
We've all thought of something.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And how many times have we've
had ideas that we've sat on

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, months
later, maybe years later,

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:19.070 align:middle line:84%
we see somebody else who
has created the same thing?

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Creativity is this
beautiful, disembodied energy

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:26.970 align:middle line:84%
that it looks for a host and it
comes through with an impulse.

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that's
separating somebody

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.210 align:middle line:84%
who manifests versus
somebody who doesn't is

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:35.200 align:middle line:84%
that the manifestor listens
to impulse and acts on it.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:90%
They do it.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: So is there a future
of what you call conscious

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:39.990 align:middle line:90%
content creation?

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah, it's happening.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the world that
I'm creating at least.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.360 align:middle line:84%
As far as content creation
goes, social media goes,

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.278 align:middle line:84%
these platforms, they're
hardwired for consumption.

00:38:51.278 --> 00:38:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like, if you're
going to be consuming something,

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I want it to feel
enriching and soul-filling.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're
craving that as well.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:84%
We're craving content that
inspires, it plants seeds.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
this program does,

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that's what Gaia does,
that's the future

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.100 align:middle line:90%
that I hope to contribute to.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Not only are you
an accomplished artist,

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:21.630 align:middle line:84%
but you also recently created an
oracle deck, "Soul's Odyssey."

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.580 align:middle line:84%
We've got a little
picture of that.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:25.600 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.605 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Explain what
we're looking at there?

00:39:27.605 --> 00:39:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: So I created
this Oracle deck called

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:34.830 align:middle line:84%
the "Soul's Odyssey," And
it really came through

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:84%
an experience where I said, I
already work with the cards.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Why not create my own cards?

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Like, why not?

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:44.660 align:middle line:90%
And I created 55 cards.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.260 align:middle line:90%
They're colorful.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I love colors, that's why
I go by Color Me Crazy.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.920 align:middle line:10%
And it basically takes you
through your soul's journey,

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.980 align:middle line:10%
the spiritual awakening.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.790 align:middle line:84%
It starts with the dawn, that
initial phase of awakening.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Then the cards move through
the challenges, the challenges

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.400 align:middle line:90%
that come with awakening.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Then it moves on to
the transformation

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.760 align:middle line:90%
that comes from awakening.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Then the enlightenment
that comes

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.310 align:middle line:90%
from it, and the culmination.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, we go back to
the dawn, the beginning of it

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.270 align:middle line:90%
all again.

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's this beautiful
spiritual journey, the circle,

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.450 align:middle line:84%
or as my partner talks
about, this spiral

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:22.620 align:middle line:90%
that circles all the way up.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:84%
We're coming back
around to things,

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.580 align:middle line:84%
but we're always going
up and up and up and up.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.210 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, I have it here.

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Yeah, you
have a deck here.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah, I sure do.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Hold that up.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Daníel.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.247 align:middle line:84%
So we got the
Soul's Odyssey here.

00:40:34.247 --> 00:40:36.038 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Take those
cards out of the deck.

00:40:36.038 --> 00:40:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Oh my gosh,
this is so exciting.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.226 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Can you pull a card
for our audience and just tell

00:40:40.226 --> 00:40:41.026 align:middle line:90%
us something?

00:40:41.026 --> 00:40:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Absolutely.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what we got going on
here for the collective spirit

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:47.550 align:middle line:90%
source creator.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.530 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's see what
we got going on here.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to take
a second to ground.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Sure.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.410 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: Connecting to
divine source creator, God,

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:90%
the universe.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
present in this space.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Asking for your guidance,
asking for your wisdom.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Asking you to make me a
channel for whatever messages

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.260 align:middle line:84%
you have for the
collective consciousness.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.910 align:middle line:84%
What do we need to
focus on right now?

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:24.350 align:middle line:84%
What messages do you
have to offer, please?

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:25.635 align:middle line:90%
And thank you, source.

00:41:25.635 --> 00:41:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to give a
quick little shuffle here.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:31.610 align:middle line:90%
This is fun for me.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:32.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just like, this is fun.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Great shuffle.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:84%
You look like you are a
blackjack dealer in Vegas.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: I mean, I don't
have blackjack money, though.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Like, that'd be nice.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Sell a few of
these cards, you will.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.564 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:45.564 --> 00:41:48.110 align:middle line:90%


00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Honestly, right here.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.100 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the message
that we need right here.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.765 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even need to--
like, I saw it immediately.

00:41:54.765 --> 00:41:55.848 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, that's the card.

00:41:55.848 --> 00:41:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And is that
the card you pulled?

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: It was felt, like
my whole center right here is

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.180 align:middle line:90%
literally charged right now.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.740 align:middle line:90%
So this is alchemy.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And alchemy is what I think
we need to connect to the most

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.960 align:middle line:84%
here, is this transmuting
anything into gold,

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.202 align:middle line:84%
transmuting this
energy that we're in.

00:42:17.202 --> 00:42:19.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people can look
at the world right now

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and they're seeing
the lower vibration.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:90%
They're like my god, it sucks.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.130 align:middle line:90%
This is so hard.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And the hopelessness,
the powerlessness

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:25.980 align:middle line:90%
that comes from that.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And source right here
is saying, from this,

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.190 align:middle line:90%
you can transmute gold.

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.740 align:middle line:84%
From this, the
universe is literally

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:36.080 align:middle line:84%
giving us all of the
tools, all of the things

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:41.510 align:middle line:84%
necessary for us to innovate
from this, for us to truly make

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.870 align:middle line:90%
something out of it.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:45.390 align:middle line:84%
This is a time for
creative thinking.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.420 align:middle line:90%
This is a time for innovation.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Pluto in Aquarius energy
is present here as well.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Is that instantaneous?

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: I think the alchemist
doesn't become an alchemist

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.150 align:middle line:90%
overnight.

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:02.810 align:middle line:84%
The alchemist is tinkering and
trying things on again and again

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:03.750 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Until finally, he gets it.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Until finally, he, she,
they, whoever, they get it.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
whoa, I made the thing.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I was able to take this and
I was able to make gold.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.190 align:middle line:84%
But we don't see
the process of that.

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what we get stuck
on, I think, so many of us,

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:23.435 align:middle line:84%
is we tried it once, it didn't
work out, and then we give up.

00:43:23.435 --> 00:43:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And right here, the universe is
saying, keep going, keep going,

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.710 align:middle line:90%
keep going no matter what.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: Where do
people get these cards?

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: So these cards,
you can find these cards

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:84%
at my online shop,
colormecrazy.store.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: colormecrazy.store.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Yep.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:39.960 align:middle line:10%
You can find my
Oracle deck there.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:10%
The cards are beautiful.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.000 align:middle line:10%
They're so colorful.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.430 align:middle line:10%
I really poured a lot
of love into this deck.

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:50.150 align:middle line:10%
And all of them
have affirmations.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Every single card comes with
a journaling prompt as well.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:59.350 align:middle line:10%
So when I pull cards for
myself, it's a sacred space.

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a moment of reflection.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think this would be a
great way, a great catalyst

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.080 align:middle line:90%
to start your days.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And just ask yourself questions,
give me an answer, God,

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.720 align:middle line:90%
give me an answer, Creator.

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.825 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're always asking
for, is like, give me something.

00:44:12.825 --> 00:44:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that's what
these cards can do for you.

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.033 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: And why don't
you, as we wrap things up,

00:44:17.033 --> 00:44:19.242 align:middle line:90%
give us another song.

00:44:19.242 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Another song?

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Yes.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Improvise for us.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Cool.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I got one song that's
been on my head.

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:28.217 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you brought this up.

00:44:28.217 --> 00:44:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> NOORY: Go for it.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>> COLÓN: It's this money mantra
song that I have, actually.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not even just money,
it's an abundance mantra

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.760 align:middle line:84%
that I've been really
sitting with myself.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: You make us all
wealthy when you're done.

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>> COLÓN: Here we go.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Here it goes.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I am rich in my mind
and my body and my soul.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I am rich with personality,
my talents are my gold.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I am rich, blessed be,
breathing in prosperity.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I am rich just like
the money tree.

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Ching, ching, it flowed to me.

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I am rich in my mind
and my body and my soul.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm rich with personality.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.780 align:middle line:90%
My talents are my gold.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm rich, blessed be,
breathing in prosperity.

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.030 align:middle line:90%
I am rich.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.320 align:middle line:90%
It's like the money tree.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Ching, ching, it flowed to me.

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>> NOORY: There's nothing
more for me to say.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
