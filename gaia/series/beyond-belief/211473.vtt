>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:10%
We've got an amazing
program for you.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:10%
Gaia Chinniah is with us, a
medium and certified past life

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.560 align:middle line:10%
regression therapist.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:84%
After experiencing a
very profound awakening

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 33, and
she'll tell us about that,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:84%
she established her own
healing company called Soul 33.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Through her unique soul
progression therapy approach,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Gaia communicates messages
from spirit guides,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:84%
applies energy medicine,
and delves into past lives

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to gain insight into
the soul's blueprint.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Gaia, you do it all.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GAIA CHINNIAH: Thank you so
much for having me, George.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.218 align:middle line:84%
I've come here all the
way from New Zealand.

00:00:57.218 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is amazing.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a long poke.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: It is.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 33, what happened?

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: I came from a
corporate background, George.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.220 align:middle line:10%
I have a master's degree,
a television presenter

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:10%
as well in Australasia,
Australia and New Zealand.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.540 align:middle line:10%
And at the age of 33, I had a
product distribution company

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:10%
in Asia.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:10%
And I was traveling up and down
between New Zealand and Asia

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.930 align:middle line:10%
very, very frequently.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And I would go back
to New Zealand,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and I would have these amazing,
traditional Maori healing

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:84%
massages with an Indigenous
healer in New Zealand.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:90%
So I'd go there for my bodywork.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And after the age of
33, I went to see her.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And she was working
on my body the way

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:90%
that she normally would.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me something's
changed about you Gaia.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said next time you come
over I want you to work on me.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.663 align:middle line:84%
So I sort of looked at her
a bit perplexed, George.

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
know what she meant.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She wanted
you to work on her?

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.952 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: That's right.

00:01:57.952 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, we were
swapping positions.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to Asia
and did my thing.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And I came back to New
Zealand completely forgetting

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:90%
what she had said to me.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And I went over
to her clinic just

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to receive my normal
massage that I'd go for.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And she was lying on the
massage table fully clothed

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:84%
with her little
puppy on top of her.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me, do
what you know how to do.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So I was sort of looking at
her going I don't understand

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:90%
what that means.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You didn't
know what to do.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.298 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: No, I
didn't know what to do.

00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:84%
But she seemed to innately
trust in my abilities, which

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.870 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know I had until then.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
I can literally

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:84%
say that something
completely took over me.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to see all the
cells in her body, George.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:90%
I could smell her disease.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I could see future
things coming up for her,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.900 align:middle line:84%
which she completely
validated because I had

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:90%
tears streaming down my face.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's never
happened to you before?

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: It never
happened to me in this way.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Mediums had told me in the
past as a 20-something year

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
old when I was attending
mediumship readings to find out

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
more about myself,
that I was intuitive.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But I never knew it was going
to be in such a profound way.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So with this
Indigenous healer, she

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to look at her
from a soul perspective.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
tell her things

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:84%
that she didn't
know about herself

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.740 align:middle line:90%
and confirmed certain things.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Just like that.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And I remember leaving
there incredibly

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed and
upset because I felt

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
like I had no control
over what was happening.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And it was quite funny, George.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I went home and I
rang my partner.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.493 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him you need
to come home because I think

00:03:41.493 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:90%
something's happening to me.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.542 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Help, help.

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: It literally was.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:90%
And I remember him coming home.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.237 align:middle line:90%
And he said what's happened?

00:03:48.237 --> 00:03:49.265 align:middle line:90%
And I said I can see.

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what
does that mean?

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I seem to be able
to see beyond the physical.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And, George, ever
since then, this gift

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:90%
has become even more profound.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
It seems to grow
every single year

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
as I graduate different levels
of my spiritual ascension.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I chose to
give up my corporate career

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and go full time into Soul 33,
and soul progression therapy

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
is what was birthed
through this awakening.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.582 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that a difficult
decision for you to make?

00:04:20.582 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: I have to
be honest with you.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It was at the time because
who I thought I was

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and who I really
am were completely

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:90%
two different things, George.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a community
where tertiary education

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.210 align:middle line:84%
was important and having
a career was important.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think my ego was
tied up into who I was.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And I had to disappoint
my ego and go truly

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
into my heart space and find my
passion and fulfill my purpose.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And my soul realized
that I had this purpose

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:84%
to be able to help people find
their path by understanding

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.020 align:middle line:90%
who they really are.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And people of all walks
of life all over the world

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:84%
seek me out for my
services now, George.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Initially, did your
friends and colleagues

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.320 align:middle line:84%
think there's something
wrong with Gaia?

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:90%
She's flipped out on us.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: To be
honest, George, others

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't seem to be as
surprised as I was.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I probably was more surprised
than everybody else around me.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I think when I look back, people
naturally always came to me

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:84%
with situations seeking
advice and guidance,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:90%
asking me to use my intuition.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't realize that
it was anything connected

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:90%
to the spiritual realm.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.895 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up in a Hindu
family and the Hindu faith.

00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
very spiritual.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.645 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Very,
very spiritual.

00:05:47.645 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So we did have a lot of
rituals and ceremonies.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
But as a young person
growing up in that community,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.200 align:middle line:84%
I never questioned
what they were for.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And after the age
of 33, I started

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
to open my eyes up to all the
different modalities and all

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:84%
the different faiths
and what they mean.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And everything
started to integrate.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And I became a lot more
aware of what I was doing

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.397 align:middle line:90%
and what I was doing it for.

00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I love your
name, by the way.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Thank you.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It reminds me of
this company that we work for.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: I know.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.683 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful coincidence.

00:06:20.683 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
it mean to you?

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: So in
my culture, Gaia

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.480 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate
mother, the goddess.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And so, obviously, in other
cultures, such as Greek,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:90%
it's the goddess of the Earth.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So my parents gave me a name
that I truly embodied in my 30s

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
as I found this ability and
became more of who I am.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gaia,
what's the difference

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.340 align:middle line:84%
between soul progression versus
past life regression therapy?

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Sure.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So past life regression
therapy, which I'm also--

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:84%
that's a trained ability to
be able to induce a client

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:90%
to access past lives themselves.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:84%
That process can take
quite a lot of time

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
for a person to be open and to
be put in a state of relaxation

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:90%
to be able to go back in time.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Part of my ability,
George, which

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:84%
happens when I see a
client for the first time,

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:84%
is that I have two portals
that open up for me.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The first portal that
opens up is a connection

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:84%
to the universe where I invite
in spirit guides, ancestors,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
past life connections
that my client

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
has had since birth
and previous births.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And the second
portal that opens up

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:84%
is my ability to travel
to different timelines.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So the difference between what I
do and say past life regression

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:84%
is I am literally
going through a portal

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and standing in a different
realm at a different time

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and much like a set
that we're in today.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And I will be able
to very, very vividly

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.920 align:middle line:84%
describe to a client who
they are, what they're doing,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:90%
what they're experiencing.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And 99% of the time,
George, because I

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
don't know any background
about my clients

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:84%
who attend my sessions,
they will say to me,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:84%
oh my goodness, the same thing
is happening to me right now.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I did get married
and divorced at 20 years.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And I do have a
son and a daughter

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:90%
or I do have that disease now.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So when I travel to
these different realms,

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.830 align:middle line:84%
it's a very, very
real experience for me

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:84%
because I can smell, I can
sense, I can taste, I can feel.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
I can fully embody
who that person was.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm able in a very
short period of time

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to give a client that
blueprint in order

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
for them to understand
their story.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think as
individuals, George,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
we all are looking to
understand who we are

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and why we are the
way that we are.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And so with my
mediumship abilities,

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I am able to access that
past life information

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:90%
and deliver it to you.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And my healer ability is able
to transmute any energy that

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:84%
may be stuck in those realms
that are preventing someone

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.260 align:middle line:84%
from progressing their soul
in this particular lifetime.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.962 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it easy for
this to coexist together?

00:09:17.962 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Absolutely.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.120 align:middle line:90%
You mean past life regression?

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Past life
and the healing.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: There's a place
for both of those modalities

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:84%
to work together,
and hence why I

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.060 align:middle line:84%
will dip in and out of both
depending on the client

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:90%
that I have.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But I find with soul
progression and my ability

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:84%
to look at the soul
blueprint, it's

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:84%
a really great snapshot of what
has happened to you to explain

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of why experiences
are happening for you

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:84%
in this particular lifetime
because we just keep repeating

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.775 align:middle line:90%
things over and over again.

00:09:49.775 --> 00:09:50.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Because that happens.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: It does.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people just
don't understand why.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm able to
go in and say, look,

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:84%
without knowing what the
client has experienced,

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:84%
this is what's happened
to you in the past.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
How does this resonate
with you in this lifetime?

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're almost in shock
and also really validates

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.720 align:middle line:84%
why they've had
certain experiences

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and what they meant
to learn from that.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So my ability is the ability to
rise above and have perspective

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.730 align:middle line:84%
on a whole situation as well
as in a very practical way

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
communicate that to the
client so they actually

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle line:84%
can do something
about it and be aware.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.125 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have awareness,
you can change everything.

00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.138 align:middle line:84%
What do you see generally Gaia
when you work on a client?

00:10:35.138 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: I
initially-- when I work

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:84%
on a client, the
first thing I will see

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
will be a blueprint
of lifetimes before.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So that gives both
me and the client

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
insight into who they are, why
they are the way that they are.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
The second part of
a session for me

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.690 align:middle line:84%
is I'll start to see
future potentials.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit guides as
well as the client soul

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.190 align:middle line:84%
will be communicating with me
because the client's soul is

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
like a database of infinite
wisdom and knowledge.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:90%
So I plug into that.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And I will start to see the
potentials the clients will

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:84%
have for their future, so things
like future relationships,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.840 align:middle line:84%
future career, future
diseases in the body

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:90%
they need to be wary of now.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So the future
potentials will depend

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.125 align:middle line:84%
on what the client needs to
hear not what they want to hear.

00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Yeah, so
after that part of it,

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I will do a body scan
of the entire body.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:90%
So because my abilities--

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By looking at them?

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.122 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: By looking at them.

00:11:32.122 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So I have spirit surgeons
that work with me.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And I have one in particular
that will stand beside me.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm able to use
my psychic scent

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.350 align:middle line:84%
to be able to smell any
diseases in the body.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Now my job is--

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.397 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a dog
can smell cancer?

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Exactly.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That kind of thing.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.782 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: It's exactly
the same for me, George.

00:11:53.782 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I can smell cancer,
and I can often

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.850 align:middle line:84%
smell cancer before I even know
who my client is for the day.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smell me.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: But, yeah,
so I can smell it.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And I can also see the
blockages in the body.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
So when I provide that sort
of insight to a client,

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and especially if I've seen
it in the soul blueprint,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:84%
they can actually be
proactive to speak

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
to their medical professionals
and do what they need

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
to do to enable themselves to
find that balance in this life

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and break the karmic cycle
because with my abilities,

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:84%
I also can see why they may
be repeating certain diseases.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.815 align:middle line:84%
Because Louise
Hay's famous work--

00:12:30.815 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: God rest her soul.

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: And such an
amazing healer she was.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.880 align:middle line:84%
There's always a reason why
things manifest in the body.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And so when I'm able
to see them plus

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:84%
have a look at why and
where they've come from

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and what that could
be for the future,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
it really gives the client a
lot of information to work with.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And I just find that this whole
process of soul progression

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
therapy is a very
succinct way of a client

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:84%
to receive spiritual but
practical information to be

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
able to ensure that they're
living a life that is full

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
of love, and
fulfillment, and purpose

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and not repeating things that
are causing them sabotage,

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:84%
or grief, or pain, or
suffering, which all of us

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:90%
experience on some level.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So I'm there to help
people break those patterns

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:90%
as well as be aware of them.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's listen
to some of your clients

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and what they say about the
work you've done with them.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> When I went to see Gaia, it
was an experience that I had

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.720 align:middle line:90%
never had before.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:90%
It was healing.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:84%
It involved intuitive
information, past life

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:90%
regression.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Having the past lives show
up was really interesting.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:10%
It was really interesting
because the lives that

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:10%
showed up for me
were the ones that

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.580 align:middle line:10%
dealt with this reluctant
path that I was on.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I was at a real crossroads
in life at the time.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I was
really looking to achieve

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:90%
was to become a mother.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And at that stage, I had no idea
how that was going to happen.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I needed to make sure that I
was spending as much time with

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
my mom as possible because
she was battling cancer

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:10%
>> At one point Gaia turned
to me while she was channeling

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:10%
and she said, you know
you're a healer, right?

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:90%
It was very matter of fact.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never had anyone
directly look at me

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and say something so
profound and something

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:84%
that I knew so deeply but
couldn't say out loud.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Right from the start, Gaia
was able to see that there was

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
a child in spirit
waiting to come in.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Just there was a
little bit of work

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:84%
for me to do before
that happened.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> She could smell illness when
I walked in, and that's not

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:90%
my illness.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.770 align:middle line:90%
It was my mom's illness.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:90%
She just knew my first name.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So there was no way to find
out anything about me online

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.770 align:middle line:84%
or through other
friends or people.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened specifically
for me was the noise

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and the chaos and sort of how
I see this sort of residual goo

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.970 align:middle line:84%
that I've brought into this life
from all these past lives were

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
now clearing away,
and we're cleaning.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>> A year to the day after
our first appointment for IVF,

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:90%
our beautiful son was born.

>> The way that she sees who
you are is something that you

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:84%
really cannot get in

[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Thank you, George.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does
disease smell like?

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: The first time I
smelt it, George, I alluded it

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:90%
to the smell of death.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it's
a very hard thing

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
to understand when I say
something smells like death.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:90%
But it is a smell of decay.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:90%
It is a smell of--

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Rotten?

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: It's a foul smell.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.738 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like eggs?

00:16:06.738 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Yes, there is
a bit of a sulfury type

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.990 align:middle line:90%
of scent to it.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's very, very distinctive.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, sometimes
before I even see a client

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
or know who's
coming, spirit starts

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
to give me that information
before a client attends

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.170 align:middle line:84%
so that I can start to
really feel that person

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:90%
and understand that person.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
The gift that I've
been given, George,

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.570 align:middle line:84%
is to really see someone for who
they are and reflect that back

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:33.698 align:middle line:90%
at them.

00:16:33.698 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't
hold back, do you?

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: I don't hold back.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I tell it the way it is.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But this is what makes
my service so popular

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:84%
is because people find it hard
to hear the truth sometimes.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:90%
But the truth sets you free.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you break away
from all the previous cycles

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:84%
that you had and can
step into your power

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:90%
as I've stepped into mine.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been able to
communicate with unborn souls

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.007 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:16:58.007 --> 00:17:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: This is one
of the most favorite parts

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:90%
of my job, George.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Communicating with
the souls of babies

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:84%
is the most purest
form of consciousness

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.420 align:middle line:90%
you can ever have.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest things I
see and why people seek me out,

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:84%
especially women,
is that they want

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
to know whether there is
a child there for them,

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
if they're able to conceive,
if they're going to experience

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:90%
any complications.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:84%
When I meet someone and
a child steps forward,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:84%
there are many,
many occasions where

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I can tell the parent the
child's name, the gender, when

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
born, perhaps even

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.270 align:middle line:84%
how many miscarriages the
parent, the mother might have.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: While it's
in the womb, right?

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Sometimes
even prior to the womb.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Even before conception?

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Before conception.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: So sometimes
it's before conception.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes mothers will
book sessions with me who

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:90%
have got the baby in the womb.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I always
say to my clients

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:84%
women will go for scans
to have a look at the baby

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:90%
and the health of the baby.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But one of the biggest
privileges you have

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:84%
is to nurture the soul
that has chosen you

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:90%
to be the mother or the parent.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And getting insight that I'm
able to get about that child

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
really enables you to support
the soul progress of that child

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
because for me, I
think it's very, very

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:22.080 align:middle line:84%
important information to know
why has this child chosen me?

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:84%
What is this child going to
need from me to be the best

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:90%
version of themselves possible?

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So with my ability, the
spirit of their child

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:84%
plus the client's
spirit guides will

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.430 align:middle line:84%
give me a lot of information
and especially if people have

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:90%
had complicated pregnancies.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I've had several clients who
have had several miscarriages.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It can give them
a lot of insight

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:84%
when I've looked
at the blueprint

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:84%
to tell them why they're
having these miscarriages.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why this is happening.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Because
it's horrible to have

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
these kind of experiences and
not understand what's this for.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's emotional.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: It's
horribly emotional

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
to lose a child during
pregnancy or even

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:90%
after pregnancy or whenever.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But because we're talking
about unborn souls,

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the most
beautiful parts of my job

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
is when these children
come in and tell me

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.160 align:middle line:90%
I've chosen this mother.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:90%
They know their names.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And they know why
they're coming to Earth.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And the new beings that
we're getting here on Earth

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
are very, very enlightened
children that are coming in.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And so our job as parents is
to really nurture that being

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and to support the society
that we live in now.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you deal, Gaia,
with people who are suicidal?

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: I do.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.762 align:middle line:90%
So part of my--

00:19:30.762 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's not easy.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.803 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: It's not easy.

00:19:32.803 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very fortunate
to be able to feel

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
the emotions and feelings
of another individual.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I will
know when someone

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:84%
is suffering from mental health
or is having suicidal feelings

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
because spirit guides will
amplify that feeling inside me.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And I know then that it's
not my feeling to hold on to.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:84%
It's my feeling to transmute
and clear for that client.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So often if I'm feeling like
that, my first or second client

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:84%
for the day, spirit
will say to me

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
this is the client that is
having these kind of thoughts.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm able to see
through the soul blueprint

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.430 align:middle line:84%
you have had these
thoughts before.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And it frees the soul of a
person to feel seen and heard,

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.030 align:middle line:84%
George, that they're
not alone stuck in there

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.212 align:middle line:90%
feeling these feelings.

00:20:22.212 --> 00:20:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They start
feeling better.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: They start feeling
better because I can feel it.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:90%
And I know how they feel.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And I just find
that many people who

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
have these suicidal
thoughts it's some form of I

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:90%
want you to love me.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I want you to know who I am.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:90%
I want to be noticed.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And because I'm
able to feel that,

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:84%
it can automatically
transmute the energy

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:84%
of going my life
is worth living.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's life
is worth living.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.200 align:middle line:84%
We're all here because
we chose to be.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
connected to spirit,

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
we will always feel that
support and infinite love.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So when I do handle clients with
a sensitive issue like that,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.440 align:middle line:84%
it just gives them profound
healing and understanding

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.150 align:middle line:84%
to be able to release
those feelings

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and find the true meaning of how
their soul is meant to progress

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.582 align:middle line:90%
from feeling those feelings.

00:21:10.582 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does it
make you feel, Gaia,

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.080 align:middle line:84%
when you have saved
somebody from committing

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:90%
this heinous act?

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: I don't let my ego
get involved with what I do,

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:19.670 align:middle line:90%
George.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:84%
I just find that I'm here to
be this medium, and healer,

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and soul progression
therapist for my clients.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:84%
I feel grateful that
that person has trusted

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:84%
in me to be so open
and vulnerable to allow

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:84%
me to feel them and see them
for who they really are.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's an overwhelming feeling
of gratitude and pure love

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:90%
that I feel.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.280 align:middle line:90%
It can be challenging on me.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a great,
great privilege.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you help
people make that transition

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.880 align:middle line:84%
to learn more about
the spirit world?

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: So each and
every time a client sees me,

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and I have many
regular clients, there

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.980 align:middle line:84%
are always messages
that come through

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.250 align:middle line:90%
from deceased loved ones.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And with transitioning-- I
mean, we all experience death.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
None of us are
going to skip that.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.875 align:middle line:84%
We have people who
pass away in our lives.

00:22:11.875 --> 00:22:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're all
going to be there.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:90%
No rush.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:90%
No rush to get there.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: No rush at all.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're all
going to get there.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.238 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: We're all
going to get there.

00:22:18.238 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm helping someone
transition into spirit,

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:84%
it's from two
different perspectives.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:84%
It's either a client has come to
me because they've experienced

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:90%
death in their life.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And I always like to
clarify this, George,

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:84%
death doesn't mean
physical death.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Death can be the ending of
something like a relationship

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.513 align:middle line:90%
in your life or we die in a--

00:22:37.513 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or a
career or something.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:39.763 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Exactly.

00:22:39.763 --> 00:22:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're reborn and die so
many times in our lifetimes

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
without the physical
body perishing.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So when I help
people transition,

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:84%
it can be through the
physical loss of the body

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:84%
where we have this understanding
of what you were here

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:58.580 align:middle line:84%
to learn and free yourself,
and also just recently

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.287 align:middle line:84%
supporting my partner and my
mother-in-law who passed away.

00:23:02.287 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sorry to hear that.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.698 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Yeah, it
was a very, very--

00:23:05.698 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old was she?

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: 78.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that's young now.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: It was very young.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very, very quick
decline because of cancer.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:10%
But it was for me the first
time on this side of death

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:10%
where I was there
for the last breath.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:10%
And as a healer, I could
feel myself holding space

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.352 align:middle line:10%
for this transition of the soul.

00:23:26.352 --> 00:23:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you see her die?

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.977 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: I did,
and I could see

00:23:28.977 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:90%
who was there waiting for her.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But as her body was
releasing energy,

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I could see lifetimes
before that she

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.490 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to hold on to
that was going into my body.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I could feel lessons
that she didn't want

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:90%
to be burdened with anymore.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of it, she
was left with this lightness

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.650 align:middle line:84%
to be able to relinquish the
body and liberate herself.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the transition
into spirit

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.460 align:middle line:84%
when we have this consciousness
that there's so much

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
more after death can really give
us comfort because often when I

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.230 align:middle line:84%
see a client who has
experienced death of a partner,

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:84%
or a parent, or a child, they
can often shut down, George.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.537 align:middle line:84%
They can shut down
and stop believing.

00:24:12.537 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's grief.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: It's not easy.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And so to be able to
process that grief

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and understand it
from a medium, healer,

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and how the grief is meant
to progress your soul,

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
it really can help
people use that grief

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.210 align:middle line:84%
to find love rather than
use that grief to hold back

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:36.608 align:middle line:90%
from love.

00:24:36.608 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
a big difference.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: It's
a huge difference

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:84%
because people can live
in that grief state.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Grief plagues all
of us, and it will.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's how we use that
to empower ourselves

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.030 align:middle line:90%
rather than to hold us back.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
reprogram yourself

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:55.910 align:middle line:84%
to make yourself a little
more spontaneous with this?

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: I really
feel that you can.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even through
my own journey.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I learn every
single client that I have.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.620 align:middle line:90%
I learn from spirit.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.820 align:middle line:90%
I learn from my client.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.335 align:middle line:90%
I learn from my own wisdom.

00:25:06.335 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're still learning.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Absolutely.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We all are.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: We all are.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
reprogramming comes

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.110 align:middle line:84%
when you are able
to energetically let

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:84%
go from within your body the
accumulation of karmic debt

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better
word because when

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:84%
I do the body scan,
sometimes when

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on a
person's physical body,

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.340 align:middle line:90%
it causes me physical pain.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Now that's because there are
so many blockages in the body

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.230 align:middle line:84%
that the client
hasn't let go of yet.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the reprogramming
comes in when

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:84%
a person is
surrendering and letting

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.400 align:middle line:84%
go in understanding that they
don't need to hold on to that

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:84%
As humans, we find it
very hard to let go.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
the ability sometimes

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:84%
to heal serious
medical conditions?

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: I do.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So because of the nature
of who I am as a healer,

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I work energetically to
re-balance and reprogram

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:90%
an individual's energetic field.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:16.525 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to have a positive
impact on the overall health--

00:26:16.525 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's huge.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: --and holistic
wellness on my clients.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a
wonderful privilege

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.215 align:middle line:84%
to help them with whatever
medical issues they have.

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we
have an example

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:84%
at how you helped
a client recover

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:90%
from a life-threatening disease.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.190 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BETH: Hi.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:84%
My name is Beth, and I'm from
Christchurch, New Zealand.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
At the end of 2020, I was
diagnosed with stage III

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.130 align:middle line:84%
colorectal cancer just three
months after giving birth

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:90%
to my beautiful baby girl.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.220 align:middle line:90%
It was such a shock.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I had no signs, no
symptoms, and had it not

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:84%
been that I'd just given
birth to my daughter,

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.780 align:middle line:90%
they never would have found it.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I was in absolute shock.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I was devastated.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
fight of my life.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I underwent a really
intense regime

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:84%
of treatment, which included
two major surgeries, radiation

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.080 align:middle line:90%
therapy, and chemotherapy.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of the
treatment, I was broken.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It was brutal.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I was dealing with
a lot of trauma,

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.390 align:middle line:84%
trauma from the diagnosis,
trauma from the treatment,

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.588 align:middle line:84%
and trauma from not being able
to be a mom to my baby girl.

00:27:24.588 --> 00:27:26.130 align:middle line:84%
There were times
during the treatment

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't even able
to touch her with my skin.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:31.860 align:middle line:90%
So I was in a pretty bad place.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Once I'd finished my treatment,
a mutual friend of ours

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:84%
had told me what Gaia was
doing now and about Soul 33

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:90%
and that she was a healer.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
knew I had to see her.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:90%
I was just guided to see her.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Gaia knew I was coming but had
no idea about any of my cancer

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:90%
or what I'd been through.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:90%
She had no information.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.930 align:middle line:84%
She worked for hours
on me energetically.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:28:00.540 align:middle line:84%
She gave me the most
mind-blowing insights,

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:84%
looked into past lives,
soul progression therapy.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:90%
It was life changing.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:90%
It was mind blowing.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:90%
I walked away just in utter awe.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.560 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
best days of my life.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.060 align:middle line:84%
I walked away pain free, and
that pain has never come back.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I walked away feeling a
deep sense of healing,

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:90%
both physically and mentally.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And I walked away with
all these amazing insights

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and really practical
information about how I could

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.740 align:middle line:90%
continue to help myself heal.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm now cancer free.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:90%
And I plan to stay that way.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of that reason
is because of Gaia and the way

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that she's helped me to
heal both what she's done

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and how she's helped
me to heal myself.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm still on my healing journey.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.980 align:middle line:84%
But I know that she's here
with me the whole way.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I'm going to
stay cancer free and be OK.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:56.970 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's wonderful.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: It is.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.162 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does
that make you feel?

00:29:00.162 --> 00:29:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: It makes me
feel emotional to be honest.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't blame you.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:07.160 align:middle line:90%
You saved her life.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Yeah, I mean
I contributed to that.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
interesting when I

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
work with people with these
life-threatening diseases,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I actually feel the
disease in my body

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.560 align:middle line:84%
after I finish
working with them.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You take
on their symptoms.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:20.752 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: I take it on.

00:29:20.752 --> 00:29:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it can take me
a few days to release it all.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's a great privilege to be
able to do that for the client.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.140 align:middle line:90%
So it makes me feel emotional.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.518 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you ever see
the movie "The Green Mile?"

00:29:30.518 --> 00:29:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: It's funny, George.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I often tell people
that it's amazing

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.760 align:middle line:84%
that Stephen King
knew that that's

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:90%
how-- it is exactly right.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.943 align:middle line:84%
Because when I release
an energy from my body

00:29:40.943 --> 00:29:43.360 align:middle line:84%
from working with clients,
it's exactly like John Coffey's

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.020 align:middle line:90%
off "The Green Mile."

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Exactly.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When he would
open up his mouth

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and those things would
fly out or come in.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.622 align:middle line:90%
Is that what happens to you?

00:29:52.622 --> 00:29:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Exactly the same.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:90%
It flies out of my body.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I can literally feel
it all coming out.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know that
you won't contract the disease

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:84%
you've just taken
away from somebody.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: With implicit
trust of the spirit

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.840 align:middle line:84%
guides that work through me,
I'm always protected, George.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.780 align:middle line:90%
And so it also requires--

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do a lot of routines
and self-care practices

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that my
body is pure and clean

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:18.520 align:middle line:90%
as a vessel for these clients.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's pure
implicit trust that I

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.220 align:middle line:84%
know that I am not to
hold on to somebody else's

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.710 align:middle line:90%
energetic garbage for the--

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
healed somebody and you

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.395 align:middle line:90%
didn't feel good?

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Oh, absolutely.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:90%
That happens a lot.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's the part
and parcel of my job.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
you get rid of it.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: And then
I get rid of it.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:90%
And that can take-- it depends--

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.090 align:middle line:84%
like after the client
that we just saw,

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:90%
it did take me a few days.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's given her a
life, and it's given her

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.790 align:middle line:90%
the ability to be a mother.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
progress a soul.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.055 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think, Gaia,

00:30:50.055 --> 00:30:53.300 align:middle line:84%
you're tapping into to do all
these things that you've done?

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.280 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: When
I connect before I

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.660 align:middle line:84%
start working on a
client, I am connecting

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.570 align:middle line:84%
with the ultimate
source of information.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And because the universe is
infinite and keeps expanding,

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that knowledge
keeps expanding too.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So there are several spirit
guides that I do work with.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.650 align:middle line:84%
But I literally feel
a cord connected up

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.010 align:middle line:84%
to the universe where
all of this information

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:84%
is downloading into my
body, into my feelings,

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:84%
into my thoughts to be
able to convey the messages

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and facilitate the healing that
a client needs for their soul

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.410 align:middle line:90%
progression in this lifetime.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: John of God
has these abilities.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.133 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: He does.

00:31:33.133 --> 00:31:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now he has done some
stupid things in his life

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:84%
that he went overboard
a little bit.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.480 align:middle line:90%
But he's a human.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: He is a human.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:39.410 align:middle line:90%
We all are.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Human beings do
stupid human being things.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.780 align:middle line:90%
But he has a power to heal.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: He does.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it God given?

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: I really feel it is.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:51.410 align:middle line:84%
I do feel-- there are many,
many healers in the world,

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.120 align:middle line:90%
many amazing healers.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that sometimes
the human nature, the ego

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:90%
can get in the way.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very, very
important for a healer

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.510 align:middle line:84%
to remain grounded
and remind ourselves

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:84%
that we too are learning,
we too have our lessons.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to find the
right person for you.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.910 align:middle line:84%
But when you're connected
to your innate wisdom,

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:84%
you will always meet the
right people, George.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:84%
You'll always meet
the right people.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
a soul blueprint?

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: So a soul
blueprint for me is the cloth

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:22.560 align:middle line:90%
that you are cut from.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So like how a home will have
a blueprint before it's built,

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:84%
you too have a blueprint
within your soul

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.310 align:middle line:84%
because for me, your soul
is a fragment of a larger

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.360 align:middle line:90%
database in the universe.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So when I access
this blueprint, it's

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:40.470 align:middle line:84%
showing me the experiences,
the lessons, and things

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.020 align:middle line:90%
that somebody has experienced.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And I call that a blueprint
because that blueprint--

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.670 align:middle line:90%
you're accumulating.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:84%
We're both accumulating
more to our blueprint just

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:84%
sitting here and having this
experience with each other.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And so we're always
building on that blueprint.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, for
example, I'm always

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:01.710 align:middle line:84%
trying to add positive,
enlightening things to my life

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.870 align:middle line:84%
to add to that
blueprint because I know

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.750 align:middle line:84%
very well that for
my next incarnation,

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I want my blueprint to
be as pure as possible

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the chances of
having to suffer and to just

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.610 align:middle line:84%
find the lightness in life
and trust the flow in life.

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So that blueprint is a very
important piece of information

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.110 align:middle line:84%
that I can look at
for a client to be

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.930 align:middle line:90%
able to navigate the future.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people who don't
know you realize what you do,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.840 align:middle line:90%
what's their reaction?

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Everyone
responds quite differently.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:84%
99% of the time
people are very, very

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.760 align:middle line:84%
receptive and inquisitive
about what I do.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people can be
a little bit skeptical.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think why my service
has become very popular,

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.940 align:middle line:84%
George, is because
I'm very, very

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.513 align:middle line:90%
practical with my information.

00:33:51.513 --> 00:33:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's who I am
as a person as well.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're real.

00:33:54.055 --> 00:33:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: I am.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very practical person, my
previous corporate background

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.460 align:middle line:84%
just being a normal,
everyday person.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But now with this
other side of things,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:90%
people find me relatable.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:90%
People find me relatable.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So when people find out
what I do, most of the time,

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.520 align:middle line:90%
they're very, very interested.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.520 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.802 align:middle line:90%
And how do you help people?

00:34:14.802 --> 00:34:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And where's your
information coming from?

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did this start?

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Yeah.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just think it gives people
a different way of looking

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
at things when they see me and
just see a woman that has gone

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:27.889 align:middle line:84%
to university,
and has a partner,

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and has family, and has
emotions like everybody else,

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:35.340 align:middle line:84%
but also has this ability
to be able to really see

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.510 align:middle line:90%
what life is about.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.489 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a
blessing or a curse?

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: It's most
definitely a blessing.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Once I had learned how to
set boundaries around it

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.889 align:middle line:84%
and to protect myself, every
day is just such a gift

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:56.489 align:middle line:84%
to be able to help people
in the way that I do.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does it surprise you?

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Every client
surprises me, George.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.623 align:middle line:84%
I often laugh and
say to my clients,

00:35:03.623 --> 00:35:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe the things
that come out of my mouth

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.490 align:middle line:84%
because they'll go, oh,
Gaia, that happened yesterday

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.800 align:middle line:84%
or that's exactly what
I'm planning to do

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.500 align:middle line:84%
or you told me three years ago
that this was going to happen,

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.730 align:middle line:90%
and it's happening now.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.800 align:middle line:90%
So it really does blow me away.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And I love having that
naivety about my job

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:21.900 align:middle line:84%
as well because it
keeps me learning,

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.610 align:middle line:90%
and it keeps me understanding.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.050 align:middle line:90%
None of us know it all.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
blessing in this job

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.060 align:middle line:84%
is because it's
constant information

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.360 align:middle line:84%
without needing to read or
needing to watch anything.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:36.222 align:middle line:84%
It's pure information that's
coming through for me.

00:35:36.222 --> 00:35:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, we
saw your clients.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.170 align:middle line:84%
How long does it
take you to work

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.707 align:middle line:90%
with them to get them healed?

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: It depends on
the person to be honest.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A week, a month?

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: So I will
see a client for an hour

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:49.810 align:middle line:90%
when I first meet them.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that
can be enough.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.540 align:middle line:84%
But my regular clients who are
really interested in the soul

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:59.860 align:middle line:84%
progression who want to move
past their previous karma

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and understand what's coming
up for them and what it's for--

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They want
a total makeover.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.565 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: They want
a total makeover.

00:36:05.565 --> 00:36:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll see them every few
months for maybe half an hour.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:11.043 align:middle line:84%
But it really depends on what
the goal is for the client.

00:36:11.043 --> 00:36:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But when I meet a client
for the first time, George,

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't get any information.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't let them speak
to me so that I can purely,

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:20.532 align:middle line:84%
intuitively evaluate
their blueprint.

00:36:20.532 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You don't want them
to tip you off about anything.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:24.615 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Nothing
at all interesting.

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So I don't get any information
so that I can purely

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:84%
look at what from my
perspective they need from me.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
work together, they

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:34.360 align:middle line:84%
will come to me
with various things

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.550 align:middle line:84%
because they're more
aware at that time.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.200 align:middle line:90%
This came up with my partner.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Why did this come up?

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I can go in and
have a look at the blueprint

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and go, ah, right, you've had
this issue 17 lifetimes ago.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's go in and heal
that, and then that has

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.590 align:middle line:84%
a profound experience
in their current life

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:53.890 align:middle line:84%
because as a healer, I can go
in and take that energy out

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and transmute it, transform
it, and place it in the body

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.140 align:middle line:90%
where there's expansiveness.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.800 align:middle line:90%
So it really depends.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.680 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
individual, how open

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.150 align:middle line:90%
they are, what they're wanting.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But we evaluate
that as we go along.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Gaia,
a cancer victim

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.010 align:middle line:84%
is on a different timetable
than somebody else who has

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:13.550 align:middle line:90%
some colon issue or something.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Yeah.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you fix that,
and do you speed that up?

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: I mean, I am
there to help them understand

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.310 align:middle line:90%
and help them shift energy.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And it can obviously
make a difference.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But it works hand in hand
with Western medicine, George.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm a firm believer that
everything works together.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not about one or the other.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And so often I do have
medical professionals

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.420 align:middle line:84%
who will send
patients to me to say

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.490 align:middle line:84%
can you just look at from your
perspective what's going on?

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll go back
and receive their treatment

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.390 align:middle line:90%
from wherever else.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So I just think it's a
beautiful partnership

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.260 align:middle line:84%
between holistic
practices like mine

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.750 align:middle line:84%
as well as the Western
medicine that's offered.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:38:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much of the client
needs to participate with you

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.420 align:middle line:90%
to get these things done?

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Sure.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:90%
That's a really great question.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I can always tell how
receptive a client is going

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.993 align:middle line:90%
to be from the moment I see--

00:38:08.993 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They walk in.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.368 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Yeah,
when they walk in

00:38:11.368 --> 00:38:13.565 align:middle line:90%
or if I'm seeing them on Zoom.

00:38:13.565 --> 00:38:14.440 align:middle line:90%
And I will tell them.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.273 align:middle line:84%
I'll be like you need
to let your guard down

00:38:16.273 --> 00:38:17.950 align:middle line:84%
a little bit so I
can get in there.

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Because some people
naturally are

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.300 align:middle line:84%
skeptical or worried
about what I will see.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But I'll always remind clients
you will never get information

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.950 align:middle line:90%
that you cannot handle.

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.300 align:middle line:90%
But everyone's different.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Like some people are very, very
open and receptive where I'll

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.190 align:middle line:90%
be able to see future lives.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And the level of information
I get is mind blowing.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And some people-- that's why
I call it soul progression--

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.740 align:middle line:90%
can only handle bits at a time.

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.160 align:middle line:84%
But they will get
what they need.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And then they can come
back when they're ready.

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'll receive a new download.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they try to
hide things from you?

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: They know that I'll
be able to see through that.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:51.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'll often pinpoint--

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I'll be like there's
something in this area we

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.040 align:middle line:84%
need to talk about, but
perhaps not this time.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.080 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about it when
you're ready to talk about it.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:58.913 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Open it up.

00:38:58.913 --> 00:39:00.538 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: We open
it up a little bit.

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And we let the client
sort of integrate

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
discuss it another time.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.637 align:middle line:90%
And then we look at it again.

00:39:05.637 --> 00:39:06.720 align:middle line:90%
So I work with the client.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.137 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say, Gaia,

00:39:08.137 --> 00:39:12.810 align:middle line:84%
is your biggest
contribution to society?

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Oh, that's a
really big question, George.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm
putting it all on you.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: You are.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.680 align:middle line:84%
I think my biggest
contribution to society

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:27.140 align:middle line:90%
is to authentically be myself.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.510 align:middle line:90%
And I know that is about me.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:33.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think because I have
stepped into my power,

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.380 align:middle line:84%
it encourages all of
the people's lives

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that I touch to be able
to empower themselves

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and see the true beauty
and gifts that they have

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and really, really explore
and understand that.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So I think my contribution is to
see people for who they really

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:54.110 align:middle line:84%
are and to really bring
them out of themselves

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.880 align:middle line:90%
to trust themselves.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
know who they are?

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: A lot of
the time, they don't.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I didn't think so.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: A lot of people
were like me prior to 33.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I need to do this.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I need to get my
university degree.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I need to earn this
amount of money.

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I need to be married with
children by this age.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And life had a completely
different agenda for me.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:17.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's been a
crazy, amazing ride.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And because I've embraced
that and gone away

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.600 align:middle line:84%
from the conformity of
the society I grew up in,

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.400 align:middle line:84%
it encourages people
to find themselves.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you happy?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Yes, I am.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I am so grateful that
I found this gift

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.160 align:middle line:90%
and stepped into it early.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.930 align:middle line:84%
I am like every other human that
has issues and things come up.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.910 align:middle line:84%
But the difference with
me is that I can see

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.570 align:middle line:90%
what they're for immediately.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So I don't get stuck in the
pattern of repeating things.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm able to
lift my perspective

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:53.305 align:middle line:84%
and look down at it,
I can see, oh, Gaia,

00:40:53.305 --> 00:40:54.430 align:middle line:90%
you're meant to learn that.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So once we've learned that,
we can move on and let go.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So my ability to let go
has become much easier

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.010 align:middle line:90%
to stay in that space.

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I like to say that I'm joyful.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:06.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't strive for happiness.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I just strive for
the middle way.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could change
one thing about what you do,

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.770 align:middle line:84%
change one thing,
what would that be?

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: If I could change
one thing about what I do,

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to be able
to physically see

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.040 align:middle line:90%
more people, George.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.035 align:middle line:84%
Because with the work that I
do, there's only one of me.

00:41:27.035 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:84%
That's probably
one of the things

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.470 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to be able to just
see more people so that I'm

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.047 align:middle line:84%
able to touch more
people's lives

00:41:33.047 --> 00:41:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and help them progress
their soul on this journey.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's prohibiting
you from doing that?

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.163 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Energy levels.

00:41:38.163 --> 00:41:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Because when I take
on someone's energy

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and have to transmute
that, everyone's different.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it weakens you.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: Not weakens me.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just because I have
to release the energy.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Depending on how
big the issues were,

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.600 align:middle line:84%
it can take me a bit of
time to come back to myself

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.950 align:middle line:90%
and feel like myself again.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm ready to go
again and help somebody else.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.907 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get ahold of you?

00:41:59.907 --> 00:42:02.460 align:middle line:10%
>>CHINNIAH: So I have
a website, www.soul33--

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.920 align:middle line:10%
the numerals 33-- dot com.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.310 align:middle line:10%
And I also have an amazing
app, George, that I've created.

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And we've got members
all over the world.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So I teach people how to
connect with source there.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.580 align:middle line:90%
We have weekly--

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's in our App Store.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Yes,
in your App Stores.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.420 align:middle line:90%
You just have to search Soul 33.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.480 align:middle line:84%
I create amazing
healing meditations.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.290 align:middle line:90%
There's lunar calendars.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.860 align:middle line:90%
There's digital guidance cards.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.910 align:middle line:10%
And we've got meditations
in Spanish and Mandarin.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:33.220 align:middle line:10%
So that's another amazing
way to connect with me.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And we create a beautiful
community there.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Often people are afraid to
have spiritual conversations

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.550 align:middle line:90%
about what they experience.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So I have a group chat
that I facilitate myself

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.590 align:middle line:84%
so people can say,
oh my goodness, I

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.800 align:middle line:84%
experienced this today,
and I did this meditation.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a spirit guide or my
grandmother connected with me.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a really safe place for
you to say what you truly feel

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.170 align:middle line:90%
and not feel judged.

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Gaia, is our
company named after you?

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: I hope so.

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You never know.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CHINNIAH: You never know.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.083 align:middle line:84%
>>CHINNIAH: Thank you
for having me, George.

00:43:05.083 --> 00:43:08.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: She's got this
incredible ability to heal.

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.270 align:middle line:10%
And that's a gift from God.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.130 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.480 align:middle line:90%
