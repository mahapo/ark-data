00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Hugh Newman is
our special guest.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:10%
He is a world
explorer, researcher

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:10%
of megalithic structures,
and the author, of course,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:10%
of many books, including
his latest, "Stone Circles."

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Hugh, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.667 align:middle line:84%
>>HUGH NEWMAN: Thanks so
much for having me, George.

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
megalithic structure?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.300 align:middle line:10%
>>NEWMAN: Sp megalith really
translates as large stone.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:10%
That's really all it is.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:10%
But when we're looking at
structures around the world,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:10%
we find many, many
different types.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:84%
We have the classic
stone circles which

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:90%
are not all circular shapes.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
geometrically formed.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
We have-- even pyramids are
megalithic in some cases

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:90%
if they have large stones.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:90%
We have dolmens.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:90%
We have long barrows.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.990 align:middle line:90%
We have megalithic chambers.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
We have giant's tombs
like we find in Sardinia.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
We have multiple different
styles all around the world.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.955 align:middle line:84%
It's not just stone
circles, for instance.

00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you
interested in all this?

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: It was actually the
crop circles got me interested,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I started investigating
crop circles in my late teens,

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:90%
early 20s back in England.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.630 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where
they had them all.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: That's where they--

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.168 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
where they started.

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: And they
keep forming there.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.138 align:middle line:84%
So I'd go out into the
ancient megalithic landscape

00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:90%
where they seem to occur.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Near Stonehenge, near
Avebury and other places.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you get out and
about into this landscape.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking into the
ley lines, the earth energies.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I became what's
called a megalithomaniac where

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:84%
I became suddenly obsessed
by all these stone

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.575 align:middle line:84%
circles and megalithic sites
and got overtaken by it.

00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Then I got introduced
to the work

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.435 align:middle line:84%
of John Michell, who's
a legendary figure

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:90%
in British Earth mysteries.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huge.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: And we
eventually founded

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.620 align:middle line:84%
with John Martino
and Gareth Mills

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and John Michell the
Megalithomania Conference

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.910 align:middle line:90%
back in 2006.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've just
been completely focused

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:84%
on researching and trying to
understand the hidden aspects

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient sites.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was going to say, did
they build them for a purpose

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
or were they just bored and they
just decided to play around?

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: They certainly built
them for multiple purposes.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.510 align:middle line:84%
We found that with
stone circles,

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
for instance, which we sort
of focused on for my book,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:90%
they're not just circular.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:84%
They're multiple
different geometries

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
which were researched by a
gentleman called Alexander

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Tom back in the 1950s and 60s.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:84%
He was an engineer,
Scottish engineer.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And he decoded not only the
geometry but the astronomy.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Also an ancient
measurement system

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:90%
he called the megalithic yard.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Since then there's been
other measurements found.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots
of other research,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
such as the earth energies,
the fertility aspects where

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
they charge up seeds if you
place them in these sites.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.658 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Literally.

00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, this
is what happens.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's multiple,
multiple different purposes

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:90%
for these sites.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.553 align:middle line:84%
Not just to look pretty
in the landscape.

00:03:15.553 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did the
ancients know about this?

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.390 align:middle line:84%
How did they understand
the technology?

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Or were they kind of given it?

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: It seems that this
technology goes back very, very

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
far in time, potentially
to the time of the Gobekli

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Tepe in Southeast Turkey.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.833 align:middle line:90%
So over 10,000 years ago.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a long time.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: And there
are traditions

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
all over the world
of the secrets,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
these hidden, invisible
aspects of these ancient sites.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And this fertility aspect
is one that kind of

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:84%
grabs me because they were
harnessing natural earth

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's highly
advanced science.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Even today people
are doing this.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the fact that they
could do it back then.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:84%
But where on Earth did
they get that from?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have to go
all the way back all

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:90%
through the old records.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And we do find kind of
hints of it going back

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:84%
to the time of Gobekli Tepe
into the old books of the Bible

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:84%
with the Watchers and the
Anunnaki and so forth.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:90%
And so we have to question it.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Why was this found all
over the world as well?

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of these mysterious
aspects that is completely

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:90%
overlooked, mostly.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it's one of
the most fascinating parts

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:90%
of studying these sites.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have been
to many of these sites.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel different
when you're in them?

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.032 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of energy or
any strangeness there?

00:04:35.032 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: You do get them
in some of the sites.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you do get that.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of interested
in geomancy,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:84%
which is a study of
Earth divination, really,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.037 align:middle line:84%
or studying the
energies of the Earth.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that's
fascinated me for years.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And often I could feel
stuff in certain sites.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Other sites are kind of blank.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel anything.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back to a site,
say, at sunrise or sunset,

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.260 align:middle line:84%
you have these sort of magnetic
lines charging up the site

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:90%
or releasing from the site.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can often get a
sense of energy there.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.290 align:middle line:84%
But with a dowsing rod, you can
detect lots of different things

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:90%
.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I also used these magnetometers
to see what's going on.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you've
got all the equipment.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So just try to work
out if there's--

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
what we can actually
detect there today.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, amazingly,
some of these sites

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
still function as they were
thousands of years ago.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.778 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
archeoastronomy?

00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Well, well
archeoastronomy,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
we have the study of how the
stars, the sun, and the moon

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
interact with these
megalithic sites.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like these sites
are aligned to--

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:84%
the summer solstice, we have
the Northeast orientation

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:90%
of Stonehenge.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.123 align:middle line:84%
We have other aspects like up
at Callanish or up on Orkney

00:05:47.123 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:90%
and other place in Scotland.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.680 align:middle line:84%
They're following the 18.6
year Metonic moon cycle.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:90%
The extremes of the moon.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.553 align:middle line:84%
We also have some sites are
aligned to specific stars.

00:05:57.553 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Perfectly
aligned, right?

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Like Venus and Orion
and other such things.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And what they were doing--
they weren't only honoring

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and worshipping these kind of
gods in the sky or these stars.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:84%
They were also aligning the site
specifically so-- and they were

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:90%
doing it in stone--

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:84%
so they could last
for thousands of years

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and become this agricultural
sophisticated calendar

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that could be used by
generation after generation.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Not just farming, but also for
ceremony and specific energy

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
aspects.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge, for example,
could predict eclipses.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So you could actually
have the elite priesthood,

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.440 align:middle line:84%
whoever's running Stonehenge--
the druids later on--

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:84%
actually kind of saying,
right now, the sky

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.120 align:middle line:90%
is going to go dark.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And it would happen
there and then

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.852 align:middle line:84%
because they could predict
when it was going to happen.

00:06:47.852 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So it had all these magical
connotations, as well as

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:90%
practical uses like agriculture.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stonehenge
fascinates me, too.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at that.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:10%
>>NEWMAN: So we're just
here at sunset just

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.716 align:middle line:10%
after the Megalithomania
Conference 2018.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I've got the orange glow of the
sun shining on my face here.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Here with Robin Heath,
Simon Banton, and about 30

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:90%
megalithomaniacs.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've just had
an amazing journey

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.850 align:middle line:84%
around the statues with
Robin and with Simon

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
looking at different aspects
and new discoveries here.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a delight
to be inside the circle.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can join us here again
every year at Megalithomania.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Every May we come here before
or after the conference

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
just with our group, the whole
stone circle to ourselves

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.920 align:middle line:90%
for a whole hour.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.985 align:middle line:84%
So it's a real privilege to
be able to do such things here

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:41.930 align:middle line:90%
at Stonehenge.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the other one
I wanted to show you.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a much larger scale.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
But again, we have
these striations.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I'll just show you some
other photos so you

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:90%
can get an example of that.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:10%
And it gives you, to
me, this is evidence

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.720 align:middle line:10%
of either common influence
or there's extreme

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:10%
traveling going on in prehistory
between places like Stonehenge,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:10%
places like Peru, Egypt, and
other parts of the world.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:10%
Just these little
things we find.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:10%
Little clues, little
signatures, could

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:10%
be the key to understanding
the global megalithic network

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.424 align:middle line:10%
that Stonehenge was a part of.

00:08:22.424 --> 00:08:25.286 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:25.286 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hugh, Stonehenge
has always fascinate me.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the size of
those boulders and rocks

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:90%
are incredible.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:90%
How did they move them?

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Well, interestingly
with Stonehenge,

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
many of the stones didn't
come all from local areas.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Some came from Wales, which
is about 130 miles away.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
From the Preseli Mountains.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:90%
The specific spot--

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's
tons, aren't they?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, these
are multi-ton stones.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And the ones from Wales are
at least 5 to 8 tons each.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
The ones locally, which is like
about 20 or 30 miles away from

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Fyfield Down-- near
Avebury, in fact--

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:84%
some of those are like 60
to 80 tons at Stonehenge.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.547 align:middle line:84%
And they go deep into
the ground as well.

00:09:09.547 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's many
aspects to Stonehenge

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:90%
we only find at Stonehenge.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
There's 1,000 stone
circles in Britain

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
that have been recorded, but
Stonehenge is utterly unique.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the only one
that has lintels.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Like, 30 lentils
going around the top.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:84%
It's got, as we
saw in the video,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:84%
it's got striations
in some of the stones

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:84%
as though they've scraped
and scooped the stones

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%
after they've softened it,
which we find in Ollantaytamobo

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:90%
and also Aswan in Egypt.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle line:90%
And so what's going on here?

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
They're shaping the stones,
they're carving them.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:90%
It's in tenon joints.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So to me, Stonehenge
is like every single--

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.260 align:middle line:84%
all the different aspects
of all the different tribes,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:84%
even from other countries,
came in and built that temple.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:84%
It was not just a
standard stone circle.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It was the national temple
of ancient Albion or ancient

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Britain.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you look at
things beyond Stonehenge,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
when you're inside,
what do you see?

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Astronomical things?

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:90%
What's there?

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: When you're
inside Stonehenge nowadays,

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:90%
there's quite a bit left of it.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.780 align:middle line:84%
You can still get a
sense of the scale of it.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.895 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize it's
actually quite large.

00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Until you get inside it and
actually witness it yourself.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people look like
little ants next to it.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.933 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, it's
quite surprising,

00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
especially because how
deep these stones go.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:84%
But you can go there on
summer solstice every year.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:90%
It's open to the public.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.080 align:middle line:84%
You can witness
the famous sunrise

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:84%
that occurs along this
great earthen avenue.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
In the distance, the sun
rises at the end of the avenue

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:84%
above the heelstone,
which is an outlier stone,

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.970 align:middle line:90%
and shines into the temple.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.467 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's celebrating.

00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And so this is like
a tradition that's

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
been going on for
thousands of years.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:84%
But we also know at
Stonehenge that it's not just

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
a summer solstice, it's actually
a winter solstice celebration

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:58.700 align:middle line:90%
And we know.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
We've got evidence,
there was people

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
from all over the
country would come down

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:90%
for the winter solstice.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Because the sunset of
the winter solstice,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.080 align:middle line:84%
the opposite time of
the year in December,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
sets in the exact
opposite direction

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:90%
as the summer solstice.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So you get this alignment
part in the year.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Then you have it with
the equinoxes as well.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ley lines.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Ley lines-- we
have these at Stonehenge.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.140 align:middle line:90%
We have these--

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're everywhere.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: --all over the planet.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:90%
It's quite remarkable.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:90%
These were discovered back--

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.393 align:middle line:84%
rediscovered back in the
'20s by Alfred Watkins.

00:11:29.393 --> 00:11:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book called
"The Old Straight Track."

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And he kept finding
alignments of sites,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.225 align:middle line:84%
whether they be ancient
wells, megaliths, mounds,

00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:39.025 align:middle line:90%
all in alignment.

00:11:39.025 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:84%
He found four or
five or more, you

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.547 align:middle line:90%
have a ley, which basically--

00:11:43.547 --> 00:11:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they find them?

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Well, he had
a visionary experience

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.865 align:middle line:90%
when he was up in Hereford.

00:11:47.865 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And he had this,
almost like beams

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:84%
of light going
across the landscape.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And he realized there was a
network around the country.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And this was developed by John
Michell and others in the '60s.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:90%
And now it's a phenomenon.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And we find these ley lines,
these connections between sites

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
as though the ancients
were specifically

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:90%
surveying certain countries.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And also some of them are
part of the archeoastronomy.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are aligned to
the specific orientations

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.030 align:middle line:90%
we find at the sites as well.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, technically, leys are
just straight line alignments.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, survey lines
on a map and such.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:84%
But since Walkins discovered
all this, people have found,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:84%
geomancers and dowers, have
found there are energy lines,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:90%
straight lines--

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.683 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Straight through.

00:12:32.683 --> 00:12:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: --energy
leys going straight

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:90%
through where these lines are.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:84%
You also get these curved
energy lines going around them.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
about these alignments

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:90%
which needs more research.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.728 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
connect to anything?

00:12:46.728 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Often they go all
the way across the country.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
We have the famous
Michael line that

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
stretches from the
east Anglian coast,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.550 align:middle line:84%
heads more or less southwest
all the way down to Cornwall,

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.350 align:middle line:84%
cutting through Avery,
Glastonbury, Dartmoor, Sir

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Michael's Mount, and so on.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we know that they were
going from coast to coast.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:90%
One coast to another.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
I do believe Edward
Leeds Scotland

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.185 align:middle line:84%
who built Coral Castle down in
Florida built it on a ley line.

00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Definitely.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he built that I
believe on a grid point.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I think there is
a major grid point

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:90%
of the planet in that area.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have vortexes where
there's spiraling energy coming

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:27.810 align:middle line:90%
out of the ground.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.792 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's
alignments going

00:13:30.792 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:84%
in all different directions
from that particular part

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:90%
of Florida.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a difference
between a grid and a ley line?

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Ley lines are specifically
alignments of ancient sites.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Grids cannot be anything
to do with ancient sites.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:84%
They can be-- it's like a
more hypothetical geometry

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Where some sites do tend to fall
on these grid lines as well,

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:90%
So you do get some connections.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The famous
researcher and author

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Eric Von Daniken talked
about ley lines on Gaia.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:10%
>>ERIC VON DANIKEN:
There are books

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.790 align:middle line:10%
on the market, for example,
from a New Zealand pilot.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:10%
His name is Bruce Cathie.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:10%
And he has a world
grid which these lines

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:10%
go all over the
planet, including

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:10%
in faraway Peru, Easter Island.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:10%
All these places
are linked together.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.710 align:middle line:10%
But this is not my research
which I can personally confirm,

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:10%
because I did not
make this research.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:10%
But it's out in the books of--

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.740 align:middle line:10%
Bruce Cathie is his name.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.147 align:middle line:10%
He was an airline pilot
from Air New Zealand.

00:14:33.147 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:10%
And his books are on the market.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.050 align:middle line:10%
And these days, there is--

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:10%
all geometry all
linked together.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:10%
I know it for sure.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:10%
For Europe, the
so-called ley lines,

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.480 align:middle line:10%
because you can prove it with
the same names, the same root

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:10%
words, and you can prove
it definitely in Greece.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:10%
All you need is a compass and
you have places linked together

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:10%
in the same distances.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:10%
The reasons for the ley lines
and for this so-called holy

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.410 align:middle line:10%
or sacred geometry are us.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:05.220 align:middle line:10%
The extraterrestrials ordered
our prehistoric ancestor,

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:09.420 align:middle line:10%
make your temples on
that and that place.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:10%
Because they knew the future
generations, thousands of years

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:10%
in the future, they will
measure their countries.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.540 align:middle line:10%
They will fly.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.080 align:middle line:10%
And then they will realize
that these geometrical pattern

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:10%
cannot be coincidence.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:10%
So it is made on purpose.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.470 align:middle line:10%
And now they come up
with the questions.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.240 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what we have.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there is no doubt
that these ley lines were they.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.972 align:middle line:90%
It's not a coincidence at all.

00:15:34.972 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: No, for sure.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with Eric.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Oh, I agree
with Eric as well.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:39.917 align:middle line:84%
And he mentions
Bruce Cathie who's

00:15:39.917 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:90%
someone I've researched as well.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is incredible, because
what Bruce Cathie concluded--

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:90%
he saw UFOs.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
He saw them moving around when
he was flying his aeroplanes

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:90%
all over New Zealand.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed that they kept
moving in specific directions.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to form a
certain grid around New Zealand.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And he applied it to the whole
planet and found it's the same.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:84%
He worked with another research
called Amy Michel from France

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.330 align:middle line:84%
who was finding the
same grid patterns

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:90%
of these movements of UFOs.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So they realized that there was
some natural energy grid that

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.660 align:middle line:84%
was emanating from the Earth
that the ancient astronauts

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:84%
were using to power their crafts
and to move around the planet.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And so their theory
is that they may

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:84%
have built some of these sites
around the world for energy

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:84%
to actually power their
crafts as they come

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.350 align:middle line:90%
into the Earth's atmosphere.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty strange.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What creates the
energy pattern on the planet?

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:90%
What is the rationale behind it?

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Is it pure consciousness?

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something is doing it
and it's the driving force.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Well, I believe
it's the natural energies

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:48.930 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the combination of
spin of the Earth and also

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:90%
the magnetic field.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And somehow utilizing
that and manipulating it.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So you have high
points of energy

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:84%
in certain places
forming this grid.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:90%
So the grid maintains itself.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:84%
There's also the
nature of cymatics

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:84%
where we have sound
creating effective matter.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So you have all the sounds
of the earth and the cosmos

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.829 align:middle line:84%
all happening at once like
some great symphony of noise.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And this would create geometric
form around the planet.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And then combined
with the magnetism,

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.780 align:middle line:84%
combined with the natural
earth energy currents

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and the manipulation of these
energies by placing these sites

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:84%
in certain places, I
think we got something

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:84%
extremely powerful
that we could even

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:90%
utilize today if we wanted to.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to
grow to grow a crop on one

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:84%
of these energy
patterns as opposed

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:84%
to putting it someplace
else, would the plant,

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.035 align:middle line:90%
would the crop grow bigger?

00:17:46.035 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, there's
been research done on that.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:84%
There's been research
done on earth energies

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:90%
and how they affect crops.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, the results--

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
there's been scientific
tests, and the results

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.700 align:middle line:90%
prove that is the case.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.433 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did the
ancients know this?

00:17:58.433 --> 00:17:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: That's
the big question.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.012 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: What were they up to?

00:18:02.012 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the basics--

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.072 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just incredible
when you look at it.

00:18:05.072 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the research
of how they were

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:90%
able to utilize this energy--

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:90%
and we can still today.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Just to just to enhance
crops and guarantee crops.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is survival
mode, really.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's so sophisticated
and yet so subtle.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.797 align:middle line:84%
And yet today, this system
could replace things like GM.

00:18:23.797 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: It could replace--

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --genetically
modified crops, sure.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, it could
replace that if people--

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:10%
and then we have to credit
John Burke and Kaj Halberg who

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:10%
wrote the book "Seed of
Knowledge Stone of Plenty."

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:10%
there's other researchers like
Alana Moore, Patrick Manaway,

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:10%
and Sean Kerwin who have
been doing research on this.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
results by their own tests.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's a remarkable discovery.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was really made by,
property made by John Burke.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Because of the crop circles.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:84%
He was researching
the crop circles.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
He was part of the
BLT research team--

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Burke, Levengood and
Talbot in Boston.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And he took it further when
he realized that where crop

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.292 align:middle line:84%
circles had formed-- real
ones, not man-made ones--

00:19:02.292 --> 00:19:04.375 align:middle line:84%
the next year, you go back
there and all the crops

00:19:04.375 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:84%
are bigger and stronger
and more robust.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, hang on a sec.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Some energy has done this.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's whatever
energy was involved

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
in the creation of the crop
circle is enhancing the crops.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And he realized
that same energy was

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:90%
present within ancient sites.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were built upon
these hot spots of magnetism

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:90%
and different types of energy.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is this energy
do for a human being who

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.110 align:middle line:90%
might have been in that region?

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Does it enhance their
health, their consciousness?

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:32.745 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Absolutely.

00:19:32.745 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:10%
It's what Jean Michell
called the enchantment

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle line:10%
of the landscape, where they
would build these sites.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:10%
It would manipulate, it would
harmonize the natural energies.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:10%
Be like feng shui in
ancient East tradition.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And you could do it
specifically at sites

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%
where then you would
then place the seeds

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:90%
and get them charged up.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:84%
If you sat there and you
meditated at that site,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
it's not just fertilizing
the landscape.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:90%
It's fertilizing you.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's also enhancing
your consciousness.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And the tests Burke
carried out found

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that it affected
the brain and there

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.360 align:middle line:84%
were different magnetic
fluctuations in the brain which

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.480 align:middle line:90%
actually caused altered states.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a shamanic
spiritual effect as well as

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
an effect of being a
practical agricultural use.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:90%
And so all this combined.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And you spread that
through the landscape.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:90%
You build all these sites.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.730 align:middle line:84%
You connect the energies
up all around the country.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And you've got this
enchanted land.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is what was called the
Golden Age in ancient times.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is really put
forward and reinvigorated

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:84%
in the 1960s and '70s by John
Michell and other authors.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:90%
And it seems to be a reality.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I have a theory that
these huge structures may have

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:90%
been built by huge people--

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:90%
giants.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.570 align:middle line:90%
What about that possibility?

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: There is very
much that possibility.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And this energy we're
talking about as well

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:90%
could enhance the DNA.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.643 align:middle line:84%
It could enhance the cells
and increase size of humans.

00:20:59.643 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
We talked about that in our
book "Giants on Record,"

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.660 align:middle line:84%
myself and my
co-author Jim Vieira.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And we went into that
in detail, actually.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And the more you look into
the myths, the legends,

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and the old stories of
megalithic sites and mound

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.720 align:middle line:84%
sites and pyramids
all around the planet,

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:84%
we have these accounts
of, giants built them.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:90%
Giants did that.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:90%
The Nephilim did that.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:90%
We have the Grigori doing that.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.850 align:middle line:84%
We have the Welsh
giants, the Kauai giants,

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Every almost every site
you go to, every tradition,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:90%
we find these stories.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Even at Stonehenge we find it.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
The earliest name of Stonehenge
was the giants' dance

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:84%
before it became
known as Stonehenge

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
because of the Saxons,
which means hanging stones.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's been 9 foot
skeletons recorded.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
14 foot skeletons recorded
in the area, the landscape

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:90%
around Stonehenge.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Stephen Quayle
has researched giants,

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and he is convinced that the
Smithsonian Institution has

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
giants hidden away
in the basement.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Skeletons, things like that.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: I believe that
there's been a general cover up

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:90%
of the whole giant phenomenon.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Well,
in North America--

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and we go into detail
in the book about this,

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:84%
because it's a remarkable
story, this sequence of events.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle line:90%
And political agendas.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:84%
We have scientific
agendas like evolution.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
We had the manifest
destiny agenda

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
to push all the Native Americans
onto reservations claiming

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.470 align:middle line:84%
that they're savages and
stupid ideas like this to take

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.400 align:middle line:90%
over the land and so forth.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And when they kept finding
40 inch circumference

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:84%
skulls and 11 foot
skeletons, they

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.267 align:middle line:84%
realized that this
wasn't fitting

00:22:45.267 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:84%
in with their theories
they were trying to develop

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and champion
through institutions

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
like the Smithsonian
Institution.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:84%
But with over 1,200
or so accounts

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.800 align:middle line:84%
we've uncovered just in
North America-- you know,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.270 align:middle line:84%
North America is
the land of giants.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.225 align:middle line:90%
This is where it's at.

00:23:00.225 --> 00:23:00.384 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was.

00:23:00.384 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:90%
It was right here.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, this is it.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:02.680 align:middle line:90%
This is the land.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.593 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not--

00:23:03.593 --> 00:23:04.510 align:middle line:90%
you get it in England.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:84%
You get it in different
countries around the world.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.995 align:middle line:84%
It's quite strong in
Britain, actually.

00:23:07.995 --> 00:23:09.875 align:middle line:84%
We're doing a book
about that because--

00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were
all over the planet.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Everywhere.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:84%
But North America is
the real hub, especially

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:90%
the Ohio Valley.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:84%
How tall where they
at their maximum?

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: We have accounts
going from 7 foot.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And the tallest
account we have--

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
couldn't find any further
evidence-- is 18 feet tall.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 18 feet?

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yes.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.465 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A human being, 18 feet?

00:23:33.465 --> 00:23:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: That's what
the account says, yeah.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No wonder it was easier
to move these blocks, right?

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Exactly, yeah.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And even in Britain near
Stonehenge, we have 9 foot

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and 14 foot giants have
been recorded near,

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.293 align:middle line:84%
within 5 miles of Stonehenge,
in the same megalithic complex.

00:23:49.293 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where
these the Nephilim?

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: They could be.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:84%
They could be spreading around
from the Bible lands who

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:84%
were thought to be the
offspring of the Watchers

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:90%
with human women.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And they created these monsters
who became the Nephilim.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's said, some
people suggest,

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:90%
they spread around the world.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And even before them,
there were Grigori--

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
their kind of
parents, if you like.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:90%
And they were responsible.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of their things
they were really good at.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Building megalithic sites.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Hugh, you have looked
at artifacts, and a lot of this

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:84%
you put in your book
"Giants on Record."

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NEWMAN: We're the authors
of "Giants on Record. "

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.850 align:middle line:10%
And in this book,
myself and Jim Vieira,

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:10%
one of the chapters is
called Curious Artifacts.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:10%
And we specifically
look at some giant axes

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.007 align:middle line:10%
as part of our research
which we feature in here.

00:24:41.007 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:10%
And we have one in
our possession now.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:10%
This is actually from a
collector in Mississippi.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:10%
A friend of ours now
called Brock Smith.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:10%
I met him a few months
ago and he showed me

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:10%
this 15 or 14 and 1/2 pound
axe which is very impressive.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.670 align:middle line:10%
And that one and this one,
which this is over twice

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:03.110 align:middle line:10%
the size of that one, was found
in Cayuga County in Illinois

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.930 align:middle line:10%
in a mound in 1904.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:07.650 align:middle line:10%
Thank god he's
actually sent us this

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:10%
so we can examine it ourselves.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:10%
It looks like it's
made of granite.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:10%
And it's over 33 pounds.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.520 align:middle line:10%
So this is one mighty
artifact that could

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.048 align:middle line:10%
prove the existence of giants.

00:25:22.048 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:90%
You've got it there, Jim.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JIM VIEIRA: I
got it, I got it.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.072 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: So this
is just incredible.

00:25:26.072 --> 00:25:27.800 align:middle line:84%
What do you make of
this as a stonemason?

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're going to even
create something like this, let

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.330 align:middle line:90%
alone use it.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is like
virtually impossible, really,

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:90%
isn't it to--

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.562 align:middle line:84%
>>JIM VIEIRA: Well,
to wield it, yes.

00:25:36.562 --> 00:25:39.913 align:middle line:90%
You can certainly make it.

00:25:39.913 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:84%
You find these all around
the mound sites in the US,

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.046 align:middle line:84%
but you find them
all around the world.

00:25:44.046 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago, Oxford
scientists in South Africa,

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.990 align:middle line:84%
they found four giant
stone axes similar in size

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:84%
to this mixed with 10,000
normal size artifacts.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.770 align:middle line:10%
And the question is, are these
ceremonial objects or are

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:10%
they wielded by an
enormously huge person?

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:90%
So I can't wield this myself.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fairly tough guy.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I lift millions of pounds
of stone in my career.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's just out of the range
of a normal human to lift.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just not--

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:16.877 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: It's not possible.

00:26:16.877 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:10%
>>JIM VIEIRA: --to
swing or to-- yeah.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:10%
So it begs the question, is it--

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:10%
well, I would say that
what's interesting

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.150 align:middle line:10%
is that so many
of these accounts

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:10%
have giant skeletons reported
found with giant implements.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:10%
Even in the Smithsonian
ethnology report.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.740 align:middle line:10%
You find it over and over again.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:10%
So an orthodox
archaeologist would say

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.320 align:middle line:10%
this is a ceremonial object.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, well,
all around the world,

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:84%
cultures have made these
oversized artifacts along

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:90%
with normal sized artifacts.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:90%
And is that a coincidence?

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a good question.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:90%
I know Jim.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:84%
He's a good partner of yours
and he does great work.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But you look at
something like that.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what the heck is it?

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: I know.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:05.950 align:middle line:90%
I know, it's remarkable.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:84%
We were so lucky to
get our hands on that.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:90%
it was ridiculously big.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It had been used as well.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So this has been
used as an axe head.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:90%
I think it was this big.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And we calculated, it must be
someone at least 9 foot tall

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:84%
just to even managed
to lift it and use it

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.965 align:middle line:90%
as any kind of tool or weapon.

00:27:22.965 --> 00:27:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or a
block or something.

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And all around
this area, we have

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.450 align:middle line:90%
evidence of wars of the giants.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:84%
This is compiled by people like
Ross Hamilton, Vine Deloria Jr,

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.170 align:middle line:84%
where they've actually
found, there's

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.380 align:middle line:84%
actually reports of
hundreds of giants' bodies

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:84%
shoved into one area
with all these weapons

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.470 align:middle line:90%
and other such things.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's a remarkable story.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And even today,
artifacts and bones

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:90%
are still being uncovered.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it a
controversy worldwide

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.575 align:middle line:84%
where all this is not
being disclosed to us?

00:27:55.575 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: I think so.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, all over the planet we've
dug up accounts everywhere.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, almost every
country on the planet.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.030 align:middle line:84%
It's really North America
where it's been more suppressed

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:90%
than anywhere else.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.055 align:middle line:84%
Partly due to certain
people at the Smithsonian.

00:28:09.055 --> 00:28:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
they afraid of?

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:11.888 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: This is
the big question.

00:28:11.888 --> 00:28:13.460 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:84%
We're compelled to sort of
seek the truth in this matter.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But there was a certain
gentleman called Ales Hrdlicka,

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and he came in the early
1900s to the Smithsonian.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And he had a kind
of philosophy where

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to eradicate
all evidence of giants

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.920 align:middle line:84%
and advanced civilizations
in the Americas

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.980 align:middle line:90%
before the white man as such.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I see.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.863 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: And so it was a
kind of negative agenda.

00:28:35.863 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of
formed the problem

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:90%
that still occurs today.

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.193 align:middle line:84%
And even in 1990, we
then had NAGPRA came in,

00:28:43.193 --> 00:28:45.110 align:middle line:84%
which is the Native
American Graves Protection

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.625 align:middle line:90%
and Repatriation Act.

00:28:46.625 --> 00:28:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And that stopped anything
that was on display,

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.965 align:middle line:84%
like things like that axe
head or any skeletons.

00:28:52.965 --> 00:28:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And we know there
were some on display.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.750 align:middle line:84%
There was even an
8 foot skeleton

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:84%
on display at the Maryland
Academy of Sciences

00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:59.720 align:middle line:90%
for many years.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.430 align:middle line:90%
These all got removed, reburied.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So all the evidence is now
pretty much disappeared.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But we have got some
leads on some more

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.310 align:middle line:84%
evidence of giants that were
going to be looking into.

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, the article
about a giant axe being

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:90%
found in North America, too.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, my gosh.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'd have to
be huge to use it, right?

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: It's ridiculous
how big you'd have to be.

00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've got other
artifacts that are being found.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.190 align:middle line:84%
There's accounts of
extremely large bronze armor.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Other aspects of
proof of this is

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.190 align:middle line:84%
that even in the Smithsonian's
own annual reports,

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.630 align:middle line:84%
not only do they mention
huge artifacts like we

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:84%
saw in the video, they
talk about 7 to 8 foot

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.920 align:middle line:84%
tall skeletons being found at
their own archaeological digs

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and published in the
Smithsonian annual reports.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they try
and dismiss it,

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.390 align:middle line:84%
even though it's
in their own books.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.360 align:middle line:84%
We bought the books
from the late 1800s,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.750 align:middle line:84%
these huge, great, massive
kind of chunky books.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.030 align:middle line:90%
And they're in there.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.220 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing to read through
these old documents written

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:84%
by the Smithsonian
archaeologists,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:90%
and yet they deny it afterwards.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.220 align:middle line:90%
And so this baffles us.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And you get the same thing in
many different other academic

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:13.100 align:middle line:84%
journals where it's all
there on the record--

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.890 align:middle line:84%
this is why we called the
book "Giants on Record--"

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:90%
and then they dismiss and deny.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they mismeasured it.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.580 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know how to
run a tape around a skull.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure an archaeologist
or a professor

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:84%
knows how to run a
tape around a skull.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
difficult. So it's a lot

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.260 align:middle line:84%
of questions as to why they
wanted to cover this up.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have they
discovered, Hugh, in Siberia?

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Well, one
of the big leads

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.770 align:middle line:84%
about where these
giants came from

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:44.750 align:middle line:84%
is the idea of
this Denisovan DNA.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And this has been found in North
American tribes up to about 3%

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.760 align:middle line:84%
DNA in some, especially the
northern areas of North America

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.840 align:middle line:90%
and Canada.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.950 align:middle line:84%
But the Denisovans
come from Siberia

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.400 align:middle line:90%
near the Altai mountains.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And Denisova cave
is a spot where,

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.020 align:middle line:84%
because of the conditions there,
the cold conditions, things

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.850 align:middle line:84%
got preserved in
multiple layers going

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.700 align:middle line:90%
down up to about 200,000 years.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:84%
They found evidence of
these very large humans.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:18.480 align:middle line:84%
We know that because the
finger bones, the tooth,

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and the recently
discovered skull fragment

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:84%
are much bigger
than they should be.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:84%
The tooth itself is
twice the chewing size

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:90%
of a normal human being.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like that, almost.

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:28.423 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, it's pretty big.

00:31:28.423 --> 00:31:31.235 align:middle line:84%
And so that alone, we
feature that in the book that

00:31:31.235 --> 00:31:32.295 align:middle line:90%
came out in 2015.

00:31:32.295 --> 00:31:33.920 align:middle line:84%
There's people Andrew
Collins and Gregg

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Little with a whole book coming
out about these Denisovans.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And we think that their
migration, because we know they

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:46.160 align:middle line:84%
got up there to up to
about 40,000 years ago.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.560 align:middle line:84%
But their migration may have
spread into the Americas.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.750 align:middle line:84%
It might have spread in
different parts of the world.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence is really
being pushed forward

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that these guys were
the giants and they

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.750 align:middle line:90%
develop things like astronomy.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.000 align:middle line:84%
We know they had highly
advanced technology

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.850 align:middle line:84%
because they were creating
these amazing green stone

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:07.450 align:middle line:84%
bracelets with drilling
technology and smoothing.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is at least
40,000 years ago,

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.090 align:middle line:84%
long before the time of
Gobekli Tepe, for instance.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
kind of question

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.840 align:middle line:90%
why is this all coming out now?

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.238 align:middle line:84%
And where else did
these Denisovans go?

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:90%
And who really were they?

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Where they really
the giants of legend?

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Were they the ones
we-- that the giants

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:84%
we know of around
the world came from?

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.138 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or the Nephilim
from the Bible, right?

00:32:29.138 --> 00:32:30.013 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:30.013 --> 00:32:30.990 align:middle line:90%
It could be connected.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:35.285 align:middle line:84%
It could have come originally
from the Siberian region

00:32:35.285 --> 00:32:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and spread into the Bible lands.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: LA Marzulli writes
a lot about Watchers,

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.950 align:middle line:90%
the Anunnaki as well.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Might they have had
anything to do with this?

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: I believe so, yeah.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.900 align:middle line:84%
If you look, and I've
read all the translations

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.380 align:middle line:84%
of these early books of the
Bible and Book of Enoch,

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:90%
the Book of Giants and so forth.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it sounds like
a matter of fact history

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.400 align:middle line:90%
of what was going on.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.540 align:middle line:90%
These so-called Watchers.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:84%
They kind of emerged
out of nowhere.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.940 align:middle line:90%
They came down from the sky.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.602 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wouldn't you have loved
to have been there to witness

00:33:06.602 --> 00:33:07.034 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:33:07.034 --> 00:33:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And they arrived down into
the so-called Garden of Eden.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And they talked-- and one of the
best translations of all this

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.460 align:middle line:90%
is by Christian O'Brien.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.820 align:middle line:90%
I've read all the Sitchin stuff.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.487 align:middle line:84%
But O'Brien, he's
done a slightly more

00:33:22.487 --> 00:33:23.320 align:middle line:90%
refined translation.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And he believes that they
were developing agriculture

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.100 align:middle line:90%
10,000 to 15,000 years ago.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
original giants.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:36.713 align:middle line:84%
And then when the third
wave of Watchers came down,

00:33:36.713 --> 00:33:39.130 align:middle line:84%
they bred with the human women,
the Nephilim were created,

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and they were the
ones who really

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.850 align:middle line:84%
got into the megalithic
construction.

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:44.642 align:middle line:84%
This is just an idea
that's being developed

00:33:44.642 --> 00:33:45.988 align:middle line:90%
by various researchers.

00:33:45.988 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's
something in there.

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something going on.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But where did they
originally come from?

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the big question.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's the mystery.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the mystery.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:54.940 align:middle line:90%
What is the Serpent Elite?

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: These
are another aspect

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:90%
of these megalithic builders.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:01.120 align:middle line:90%
We have the giants in one case.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.400 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
this kind of elite

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.980 align:middle line:84%
who we find evidence of carved
in stone all around the world.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.659 align:middle line:84%
And the first place
we really find this

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.969 align:middle line:84%
is Gobekli Tepe in
Southeast Turkey which

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:15.190 align:middle line:90%
is nearly 12,000 years old.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.817 align:middle line:90%
Although when we spoke--

00:34:16.817 --> 00:34:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe more.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:18.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Maybe more.

00:34:18.525 --> 00:34:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And we think this
could be reality

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.230 align:middle line:84%
because when Klaus Schmidt
spoke to us before he died,

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:27.439 align:middle line:84%
he admitted he believed that
it could be up to 14,000 years

00:34:27.439 --> 00:34:28.239 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.322 align:middle line:84%
So this is before the time
of the great cataclysm.

00:34:30.322 --> 00:34:32.043 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could it be
a million years old?

00:34:32.043 --> 00:34:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: I don't
know about that.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.480 align:middle line:90%
But who knows?

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Michael Cremo writes that--

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Much older

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: And so we find all
these carvings of serpents

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:42.030 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
We find them all over the world.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.449 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
question what was this.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And there are these traditions
of these great teachers going

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.969 align:middle line:84%
way back in time
right to the time

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.280 align:middle line:90%
of the Anunnaki, the Watchers.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.747 align:middle line:90%
Enki was related to a serpent.

00:34:56.747 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Zecharia Sitchin
writes a lot about Enki.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:34:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: And his symbol was
a staff with a serpent coiling

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.260 align:middle line:84%
around it before the
Caduceans became--

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was he the first
serpent that we know of?

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:08.848 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: He was
the first serpent.

00:35:08.848 --> 00:35:11.950 align:middle line:84%
He was also thought to be the
serpent in the Garden of Eden

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:90%
with Adam and Eve.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The devil--

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Given the knowledge.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.890 align:middle line:90%
- >>NOORY: Basically.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.057 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Potentially, yeah.

00:35:16.057 --> 00:35:19.942 align:middle line:84%
And so, but that's been
misconstrued as being negative.

00:35:19.942 --> 00:35:22.150 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it was to do
with knowledge and sharing

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.277 align:middle line:90%
this high knowledge and wisdom.

00:35:24.277 --> 00:35:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And then it spread from
there through people

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:31.233 align:middle line:84%
like the Grigori, the Anunnaki,
the Watchers, and the Nephilim.

00:35:31.233 --> 00:35:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's when
it spread around the world

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.390 align:middle line:84%
when their cataclysm happened--
when the Great Flood happened.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And they were keeping
this knowledge alive.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think there were
two groups, really.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:84%
The serpents and the
Nephilim or the giants.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And they split up,
split off, and spread

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.740 align:middle line:90%
and created these sites.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of went through
different migrations

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:56.220 align:middle line:90%
and different breeding patterns.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.130 align:middle line:84%
But these traditions maintained
themselves, harking back

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:90%
to this kind of Golden Era.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:07.690 align:middle line:84%
On the Gaia show "Deep
Space," they talk about Enki.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:10%
>>EXPERT 1: Anunnaki,
or the Anunnak gods

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:10%
as they were known
in the Sumerian times

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:10%
and from the Sumerian
texts and the clay tablets,

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.600 align:middle line:10%
were beings from
another planet who

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.720 align:middle line:10%
came to Earth in search
for gold, apparently.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.530 align:middle line:10%
That's what seems to be the main
thread of the Anunnaki story.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:27.220 align:middle line:10%
So whatever perception
people may have Anunnaki

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.510 align:middle line:10%
or the Anunnak gods is a
broad perspective, I believe.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:33.350 align:middle line:10%
Different people have
different views on it.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.250 align:middle line:10%
They clearly played a very
important role in the situation

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.950 align:middle line:10%
we seem to find ourselves in
today and this world of ours.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:42.710 align:middle line:10%
They had a very big role to
play in cloning activities

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:43.510 align:middle line:10%
on this planet.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.350 align:middle line:10%
Different animals,
different species,

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.340 align:middle line:10%
including our human
race which seems

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.620 align:middle line:10%
to be one of the projects
they undertook here--

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.820 align:middle line:10%
to clone a new species.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.820 align:middle line:10%
>>EXPERT 2: The most authentic
of the creation stories

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.010 align:middle line:10%
that we have specifically
say that that's

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.760 align:middle line:10%
exactly what human beings were
bioengineered to do-- to be

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:10%
slaves for the ER society.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.490 align:middle line:10%
They were designed to
get agriculture going

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:09.680 align:middle line:10%
and they were designed
then to build structures

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.810 align:middle line:10%
for the use of the gods.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:13.740 align:middle line:10%
Zecharia Sitchin takes
it a step further.

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.890 align:middle line:10%
He looks in to maybe
they were intended

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.930 align:middle line:10%
to do gold mining also.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:22.610 align:middle line:10%
So yes, you can say that if you
take those myths seriously--

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:25.790 align:middle line:10%
and I use the myth
word cautiously

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:31.040 align:middle line:10%
because some of the stories that
we find in ancient Mesopotamia

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.470 align:middle line:10%
have been acknowledged
by archeology.

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:35.690 align:middle line:10%
For example, the fact
that agriculture did

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.520 align:middle line:10%
start in that very region.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.490 align:middle line:10%
That Gobekli Tepe seems to be
our first shrine which started

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:42.290 align:middle line:10%
where agriculture started.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:10%
So we can maybe take
some of that seriously.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.620 align:middle line:10%
But they said that that's why
humans were designed-- what

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.620 align:middle line:10%
they were designed to do
was to be the slave race

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.290 align:middle line:10%
to get those things built
and get all that going.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some incredible
experts, Hugh.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.720 align:middle line:84%
The serpent itself-- what
did it symbolize to you?

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: To me it symbolizes
a couple of things.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.760 align:middle line:84%
One of them is this
secret knowledge

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.543 align:middle line:84%
that was passed down from
these very early times

00:38:11.543 --> 00:38:12.960 align:middle line:84%
like we're seeing
this video, what

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.990 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking about from
the Anunnaki, the Watchers.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And also, as it developed,
one of their key principles

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.370 align:middle line:84%
they were working with, even
back in the very beginning

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:28.290 align:middle line:84%
of time, the human timeline,
is agriculture and fertility.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And this was a manipulation
of the Earth energies.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:90%
The telluric currents.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.803 align:middle line:90%
The magnetic field.

00:38:33.803 --> 00:38:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is why they were
building these sites.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:40.150 align:middle line:84%
This is why they were
developing agriculture,

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.630 align:middle line:84%
their societies
in specific areas

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.820 align:middle line:84%
where they could manipulate
this Earth energy.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was a secret
tradition and it

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.170 align:middle line:84%
was a survival
tradition, where they

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.540 align:middle line:84%
would be able to work
with these energies.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
symbol of the serpent

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.520 align:middle line:84%
is the sinuous movement
of the Earth energies

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.530 align:middle line:84%
just like they moved
through the land.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the high
wisdom and the knowledge,

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:90%
the megalithic construction.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:84%
What is now being hidden
inside secret societies.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.355 align:middle line:90%
This is what it was all about.

00:39:09.355 --> 00:39:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Isn't the symbol for
pharmacology the serpent

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.440 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.482 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, well, we
have the caduceus, which

00:39:15.482 --> 00:39:19.980 align:middle line:84%
is almost the symbol of Enki,
is staff with the serpent going

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.780 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.322 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The serpent
going around it.

00:39:22.322 --> 00:39:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: It is the original
design of the symbol of Enki.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And then they developed that.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And many of these so-called
Watchers or Anunnaki

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and so forth from
the earliest times--

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.730 align:middle line:84%
not only were they kind
of priestly elites,

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.830 align:middle line:84%
they were healers and they
were conductors as well.

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.610 align:middle line:84%
This is what Christian O'Brien
has been putting forward

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:42.532 align:middle line:90%
in his research.

00:39:42.532 --> 00:39:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go to
South America for a moment

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and talk about the
myth of Quetzalcoatl

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.670 align:middle line:90%
and also the Viracocha.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: We have these separate
traditions, specifically

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.880 align:middle line:84%
plume serpents, that go way,
way back to the mists of time.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Plume serpents.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: And these are unusual,
slightly different features,

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:04.260 align:middle line:90%
different ideas.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But we have, for example, in
Central America and Mexico

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:11.910 align:middle line:84%
along the Gulf Coast, we have
Quetzalcoatl. or Kukulcan.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.580 align:middle line:84%
He arrived on a so-called
raft of serpents

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.780 align:middle line:90%
with a group of helpers.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did not look like the
people of that indigenous area

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:19.290 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: No.

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:84%
They were tall,
supposedly fair-skinned.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.697 align:middle line:90%
So perhaps they came from--

00:40:24.697 --> 00:40:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: White hair.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.447 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah, clear.

00:40:26.447 --> 00:40:28.970 align:middle line:90%
And bright blue eyes.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:31.020 align:middle line:84%
They came onto the land
and they were very kind.

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.420 align:middle line:84%
They would teach the
arts and sciences

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.193 align:middle line:84%
of agriculture, construction,
even things like vegetarianism.

00:40:37.193 --> 00:40:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were thought
of as Gods, weren't they?

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.193 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: They were.

00:40:40.193 --> 00:40:41.220 align:middle line:90%
They were seen as gods.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And they spent over 20 years
or about 20 years in the land

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.750 align:middle line:84%
bringing this peace and
prosperity and knowledge,

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe, of this fertility
and building so they could grow

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.910 align:middle line:90%
crops and things like this.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.080 align:middle line:90%
As well as calendars.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:84%
They introduced the
ancient calendars

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.250 align:middle line:84%
that became what's known
as the Mayan calendar.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They were way
ahead of their time.

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:01.687 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Way ahead
of their time.

00:41:01.687 --> 00:41:03.980 align:middle line:84%
We get a similar situation
down in South America

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:84%
with Viracocha who
emerged from Lake Titicaca

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.950 align:middle line:84%
onto the Island of the Sun and
built the megalithic temples

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:13.440 align:middle line:84%
along the so-called Path of
Viracocha, which is actually

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.340 align:middle line:84%
a leyline that goes from
Northwest to Southeast

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.700 align:middle line:84%
across the land through
Cuzco and other sites.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But he, interestingly
created a race of giants

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:29.100 align:middle line:84%
from mud or stone or earth
to build these temples.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And they got out of
hand, out of control,

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and he had to destroy them with
a flood, much like the Nephilim

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:37.770 align:middle line:90%
of ancient Bible land.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Noah

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting the
same kind of stories.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think there
are connections,

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.370 align:middle line:84%
because in South America,
there was something discovered

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.950 align:middle line:84%
called the fuente
magma bowl back

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.010 align:middle line:84%
in the late 1950s,
early 1960s, which

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.870 align:middle line:84%
has Sumerian writing
on it which goes

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.220 align:middle line:90%
back several thousand years.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.220 align:middle line:90%
And so there are connections.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And it may be the proof that
indeed the people, the serpents

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:03.630 align:middle line:84%
from the Bible lands, made
their way over to South

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:04.810 align:middle line:90%
America in deep prehistory.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's very possible.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.225 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the significance,
Hugh, of your work.

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Well,
I just think what

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at is just
trying to understand

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.370 align:middle line:90%
who these people were.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Trying to get into the mindset
of who they could have been.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Not only the giants,
which fascinates me

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:22.990 align:middle line:84%
because it's this missing
chapter in human history,

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:25.960 align:middle line:84%
but also the secret aspects
of these megalithic sites

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:84%
which I believe were built and
designed by the serpent people

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.730 align:middle line:84%
with the giants assisting
them with the stonework

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and their megalithic
masonry techniques.

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:39.910 align:middle line:84%
There were traditions, like with
the cyclops of ancient Greece.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.100 align:middle line:90%
And they were metallurgists.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.520 align:middle line:90%
They were stone workers.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.710 align:middle line:84%
They were masters
of their trade.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Why would they be so strong
in traditions like this?

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just think this lost
energy science of the ancients

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.510 align:middle line:84%
is something else that
needs to be addressed

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:56.970 align:middle line:84%
because the fact is,
some of these sites

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.192 align:middle line:84%
still work today even
in this ruinous state.

00:42:59.192 --> 00:43:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
don;t know how or why.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.560 align:middle line:10%
So if we were to rebuild some
of these sites or experiment,

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.770 align:middle line:10%
we know there are fiberglass
pyramids being built in Russia.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.750 align:middle line:10%
People are doing these tests
and are getting amazing results.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got this
solution to world problems.

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:17.550 align:middle line:10%
The abundance of crops
and agriculture and health

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:22.860 align:middle line:10%
and vitality could be
why we're in such a state

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.870 align:middle line:10%
now-- because we're not building
with these geomantic principles

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:26.670 align:middle line:10%
anymore.

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.250 align:middle line:10%
We're building just
chaotic cities and towns.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:30.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's harmful to our health.

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.780 align:middle line:84%
We have what's called
geopathic stress.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the ancients
had an understanding

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.680 align:middle line:84%
of how to harmonize the
landscape, the enchantment

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.580 align:middle line:90%
of the landscape.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need to
get back into that mindset

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.030 align:middle line:90%
of the ancients.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.712 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we could, it could
change the face of this planet.

00:43:44.712 --> 00:43:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: I believe
it could, yeah.

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
very, very good point.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think hopefully
with the work I'm doing--

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and there's many other
researchers who are doing

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:54.290 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:56.580 align:middle line:84%
we're pushing forward
and trying to bring back

00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:84%
this knowledge that's been
hidden, that's been suppressed,

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and bring it back
out into the open.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, don't stop.

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Don't stop.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Hugh, thanks for being
on Beyond Belief.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWMAN: Thanks
so much, George.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.500 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.610 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fascinating research,
these megalithic structures.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:14.100 align:middle line:10%
What they were built
for, how they were built,

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.960 align:middle line:10%
who built them.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Will we get the answer?

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, we will with people like
Hugh Newman investigating.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
