>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:10%
Our very special guest,
Richard Estep is with us.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.460 align:middle line:10%
Now Richard is
paranormal author who

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:10%
has written more than a dozen
books detailing its most

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:10%
harrowing investigations.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Richard has also co-founded
the Boulder County Paranormal

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Research Group with his wife,
Laura, and that was in 1999.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And he has also appeared on
a number of television shows,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.390 align:middle line:84%
"Haunted Hospitals" and
"Paranormal 911" on the Travel

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Channel.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Richard, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD ESTEP: Thank
you for having me, George.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in all of this?

00:00:57.112 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:10%
>>ESTEP: Well, as a young kid,
I grew up in a haunted house

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.695 align:middle line:10%
that my grandparents owned.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ooh.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:10%
>>ESTEP: And that
fascinated me, you know?

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:10%
There were no TV shows
back in those days.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:10%
There were no "Ghost
Hunters," "Ghost Adventures"

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:10%
kind of shows.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:10%
And you had to go to books.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:10%
You had to haunt your library,
if you'll pardon the pun,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:10%
in order to get your ghost fix.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.797 align:middle line:90%
And I was that kid.

00:01:14.797 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it stuck with
you forever, didn't it?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Forever.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And came with me when I moved
from the US-- excuse me,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.305 align:middle line:90%
the UK to the US in 1999.

00:01:22.305 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What caused
that move for you?

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: I worked for a
local company here, IBM,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.167 align:middle line:90%
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just a
small, little company.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Yeah, a
small, little company.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you never forgot
the paranormal, did you?

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: You know, it got into
my blood at a very young age.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And all kids love ghost stories,
but I never outgrew that love.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And I spent years in the UK
investigating and learning

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.140 align:middle line:84%
the technique for researching
claims of the paranormal.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And there were so
many great places here

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
to bring that to.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.272 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it that
makes a house haunted?

00:01:52.272 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Oh, that's a
great question, isn't it?

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking, in
my experience, George,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
there are three
types of haunting.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
You've got haunted
places, haunted objects,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:90%
and haunted people.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So it might be somebody
that lives in the house.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
It might be the house itself, or
the ground that it's built on.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or the ground.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Or an
object that has been

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
brought into the
house, and sometimes

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:90%
a combination of all three.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you ever want
to live atop a cemetery?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: You know, isn't
America one big cemetery?

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.065 align:middle line:84%
Isn't every country one
big cemetery, essentially?

00:02:21.065 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Having come from the
London area in the past,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.000 align:middle line:84%
London is built upon
generations of Londoners.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's built on
plague pits dating back

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.540 align:middle line:90%
to the Black Death.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So in a kind of
real sense, we all

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.930 align:middle line:90%
do live on top of a cemetery.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.888 align:middle line:90%
That's what society is.

00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:36.013 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you like to
live in a haunted house,

00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:90%
knowing somebody died there?

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: I mean, I have.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
I've spent time living in
several haunted locations,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and one of them at least
belonged to a serial killer.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The murders took
place in the house.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:84%
That was Fox Hollow
Farm in Indiana.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.105 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And it's not always
the most pleasant of things,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:84%
but yeah, I'm OK with
that kind of background.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't think I'd want
to live in a house like that.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Too much energy.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.645 align:middle line:90%
Negative energy there.

00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: But you
know, there are people

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
that bring positive energies
to places like that.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:90%
And I like the idea.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Energy, after all, is
what this is all about.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I like the idea that you
can convert a negative

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:90%
into a positive.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you go to
these haunted locations,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
are people calling you, saying,
hey, this house may be haunted,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:90%
come investigate it?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.333 align:middle line:90%
Or do you already know about it?

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.667 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Well, much like
yourself, George, I'm a writer,

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and I'm always
interested in a story.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:90%
A human story.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.928 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And so I
generally will be

00:03:28.928 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
interested in the
lives of those that

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:84%
have lived at the location and
the strange things that occur

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:90%
while people are living there.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I always look at.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
What's the story
to be told here,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and how can I add a
chapter of my own?

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing
work that you do.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:90%
You like it.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: I love it.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:90%
It's my passion.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Most people go on vacation
and they'll take a cruise

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.232 align:middle line:84%
or go sit on the
beach, you know?

00:03:50.232 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm fortunate I have an
understanding wife that

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.080 align:middle line:84%
lets me go live in
an old abandoned

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:90%
hospital for a week or a jail.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I go to jail--

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.408 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of jail time
as a paranormal investigator.

00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are jails haunted too?

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.533 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Enormously.

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:84%
When you think
about it, the amount

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.623 align:middle line:84%
of negative energy
you get in a jail--

00:04:05.623 --> 00:04:06.582 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it's huge.

00:04:06.582 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: --the amount of
despair, the amount of anger,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:90%
the amount of hatred.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
It would amaze me if
some kind of psychic scar

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:90%
wasn't left over from that.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.505 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you, Rich?

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:19.178 align:middle line:90%
What pushes you into this area?

00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: I think
like everybody else,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I've always had this
fascination of what

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:90%
happens to us after we die.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all want to know,
and we'll all find out one day.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.075 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or we won't.

00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Or we won't.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Good point.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:90%
But to that, I want to--

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted to have
a look behind the veil

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:90%
to see what's in the next room.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:84%
It's that curiosity
that drives me.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got an
investigator, Jeff Belanger,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
a great guy who's talked
about traveling to a haunted

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:90%
location.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And a master
storyteller too, is Jeff.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at one of his stories.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.492 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.492 --> 00:04:50.950 align:middle line:10%
>>JEFF BELANGER:
If you want to say

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:10%
there's no such thing
as ghosts, that's fine.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:10%
I don't personally believe that.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle line:10%
But at the same time,
the stories are real.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:10%
The history's real.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:10%
And in a lot of
respects, George,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:10%
ghosts are history
demanding to be remembered.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:10%
To talk about ghosts,
to talk about hauntings

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:10%
is to talk about our past,
to connect with our past,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:10%
with our ancestors,
with our history.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.315 align:middle line:10%
All of that stuff goes into
making us who we are today.

00:05:11.315 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:10%
And what better
way to explore it

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:10%
than with these great stories?

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.855 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You have a
passion for this stuff.

00:05:15.855 --> 00:05:17.105 align:middle line:10%
>>BELANGER: I love this stuff.

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:10%
It's so much fun.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:10%
You know, when I travel, I
want to see haunted places.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:10%
I want to become part
of those stories.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:10%
You know, you hear these things,
you see them on television,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.310 align:middle line:10%
you hear them on
"Coast to Coast,"

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:10%
and you want to see them for
yourselves, because maybe,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:10%
just maybe you're going
to have that experience,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:10%
that once-in-a-lifetime event
that makes you say, whoa.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:10%
There's more to this
than meets the eye.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why are these
places, Jeff, haunted?

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what is creating
this kind of energy

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.630 align:middle line:10%
where these spirits,
entities, whatever they may be

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:10%
hang around?

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.608 align:middle line:10%
>>BELANGER: That's the
million dollar question.

00:05:48.608 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] If I knew
for sure, I think

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:10%
there's as many reasons for
ghosts as there are ghosts.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:10%
In some respects, there's
a tragedy that took place.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:10%
And people talk
about that tragedy.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.590 align:middle line:10%
We relive it.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:10%
We give energy to it the
more we say, oh, this

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:10%
is where there was a
murder or a suicide

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:10%
or an unfortunate death.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:10%
And so that's often the
backstory of a haunting.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:10%
But not always.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.132 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it's just
like a movie that

00:06:09.132 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:10%
replays over and over again.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:10%
It's just the past
that just almost

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.605 align:middle line:10%
gets imprinted on a location.

00:06:13.605 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:10%
We might call it the
stone tape theory.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:10%
But there's so many different
theories to what's the reasons.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:10%
To me, it's simply a place
is haunted when people

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:10%
have experiences, when
they talk about it,

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:10%
and it gets a reputation.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, if things happen often,
it's an active haunting.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.932 align:middle line:10%
If it's years in
between, not so much.

00:06:31.932 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's like you.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.220 align:middle line:90%
He's excited about what he does.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And Jeff makes some
very salient points there,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and he talked about some of the
things like murder and suicide.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
But I would also add that
positive hauntings occur

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
very commonly too, when somebody
loves a place a great deal,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.307 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the old
lady and gentleman

00:06:50.307 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:84%
that bought their dream home and
they lived there for 50 years

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and were blissfully happy there,
raised a family, they pass on.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Either they leave something
of themselves behind

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
or they come back and
visit, or so it seems.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Now the truth is, unfortunately,
those kind of stories

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.880 align:middle line:84%
aren't great for headlines
and they're not popular.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Scary sells.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But they're every bit as
common, if not more so,

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:84%
than some of the darker stuff,
and that's a wonderful thing.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've got a house that
was built in 1926 in St. Louis,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and for a couple of years my
granddaughter lived there.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And I go back and forth between
St. Louis and Los Angeles.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And she would always say, Papa,
I see a little old man in here

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:90%
sometimes at night.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, come on, Ari.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen a
little old man there,

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and I've been there
for 12, 13 years.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And then my daughter spent
the night there one night.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Dad,
did anybody ever

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.760 align:middle line:84%
tell you about some kind of
little old man in this house?

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And she had not talked to
my granddaughter about that.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.200 align:middle line:90%
It was her aunt.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:90%
And I said, uh, yeah.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And she described the same
kind of entity or being.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.405 align:middle line:84%
Something's here,
obviously, right?

00:08:04.405 --> 00:08:05.205 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:08:05.205 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps a former resident
of the home, you know?

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Someone that was
happy there, someone

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that went through the same
routine over and over again.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:84%
As Jeff said, sometimes you get
these less active hauntings,

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost as if it's an
after echo of the person that

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:90%
lived there, you know?

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:84%
We get this glimpse
into the past.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't mean it's intelligent.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean there
is literally somebody

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:84%
there that she could
communicate with any more

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
than you could communicate
with a picture on your TV set.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's just replaying
itself over and over

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
until that energy finally
Peters out and goes away.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.915 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do
they wander around?

00:08:36.915 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Why do they stay in the house?

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Is it because they like
the place and they need it?

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:90%
Don't they know they're dead?

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: In the case of
an intelligent haunting,

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're drawn
there or they stay there

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:90%
for some kind of purpose.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:84%
The earliest haunting that
I'm aware of on record

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
takes us back to
ancient Rome, and it

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
was a house that was haunted
by the classic clanking chains

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:84%
kind of ghost that
was trying to--

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Scrooge.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:90%
Scrooge.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Very, very
similar to that, yeah.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:84%
But was trying to
indicate that its body had

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:90%
been buried in the yard.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And once the body
was uncovered--

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:84%
the ghost would walk
out into the yard

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and residents of the
home were terrified.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
They would never
follow this apparition.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Indicated that if they
dug in a certain spot,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.400 align:middle line:84%
they would find the body
of the murdered man.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the purpose in that
case was some kind of closure.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And we
often see that there

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.740 align:middle line:84%
is that kind of aha
moment in some hauntings.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Many seem to just want
acknowledgment, George.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
But others are no more
aware of us than--

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I should say, they can't
interact with us, you know?

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I flip on my TV, I
see you on my screen,

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:84%
you're not actually
in my living room.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:90%
It's an image of you.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think many
ghosts are that way.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.438 align:middle line:90%
They're a natural phenomenon.

00:09:49.438 --> 00:09:50.938 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: If someone
believes they're

00:09:50.938 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:10%
living in a haunted
house and they need

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.615 align:middle line:10%
some help, what do they do?

00:09:54.615 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Well, the first thing
I really like to tell people is,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.650 align:middle line:90%
don't be afraid.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Do not live in fear, OK?

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we are afraid
of the unknown.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But what I recommend
that you do is start

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
to keep a log of what strange
things happen at what times

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
of the day, because a reputable
paranormal investigator will

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:84%
come in and will
look for patterns.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Do things always occur at
a certain time of the day

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:90%
or at night?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I investigated one
case, for example,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.110 align:middle line:84%
where we found that the
reason the house was starting

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.428 align:middle line:84%
to act strangely was that
they were on the main flight

00:10:24.428 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:84%
path to Denver
International Airport.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And we were able to
correlate these strange sounds

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.010 align:middle line:84%
inside the house
with flight patterns

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:84%
overhead, heavy aircraft
coming in to land.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I
recommend contacting

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
a reputable investigator,
but giving them

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:90%
some data to work with.

part of the allure for

I became that ghost guy

that I would have other EMTs
and paramedics and then nurses

00:13:52.143 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and doctors, you know, oh,
you've got a ghost story.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Tell that ghost guy when
he brings a patient in.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.180 align:middle line:84%

hearing these stories from so

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.807 align:middle line:90%
many medical professionals.

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:02.640 align:middle line:84%

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.003 align:middle line:84%
you've met many people
in the medical field.

00:14:06.003 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're very close
to death, and we're

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:84%
very close to those
extremes of emotion.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, this
is a huge phenomenon

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.843 align:middle line:90%
within the medical community.

00:14:14.843 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And many of them did not
want to be identified

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:84%
when they shared their stories,
which makes me more impressed.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.490 align:middle line:84%
These weren't people that
were seeking to become famous.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.610 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted to say, this
strange thing happened to me.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, but
then I don't want

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.478 align:middle line:84%
to be associated
with this publicly.

00:14:30.478 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a call
from a police officer

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
on the radio show one day, and
they were the first responders.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
They got there before
even the EMTs got there.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And the call was that somebody
was dying of a heart attack.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Get to this house.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.225 align:middle line:84%
So they got there
before the EMTs.

00:14:45.225 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:90%
They get to the door.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.058 align:middle line:90%
They knock on the door.

00:14:47.058 --> 00:14:51.110 align:middle line:84%
A little man opens the door for
them and kind of shows them in.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And immediately on the
floor on his stomach

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.630 align:middle line:84%
is somebody who obviously
is in distress or dying.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:90%
They get to him.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:90%
He's dead.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.740 align:middle line:90%
They turn him over.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the little old man who
opened the door to let them in.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And this was a police officer
who's calling the program,

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.152 align:middle line:90%
and he's dead serious.

00:15:15.152 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Has nothing to
gain by making this up,

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.110 align:middle line:90%

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.170 align:middle line:84%

run in the same way

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.790 align:middle line:84%
that sergeants
make the army run.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.590 align:middle line:84%
They'll tell you
what they think.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are a little
more circumspect,

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:84%
but many doctors have
come to me over the years,

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and they've said, you know, I
have a scientific background.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
this kind of hooey.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:90%
But this one time--

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And they go on and
tell me this incredible--

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, but how
do you explain that, doc?

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.847 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And they say,
well, one of those things.

00:15:50.847 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they
still don't believe.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Right.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Or they don't think about it.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
examine this too closely,

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:84%
because as you're well aware
and your viewers are well

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:84%
aware, if you start looking
into phenomena like this,

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
you realize the world is much
broader and stranger than most

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
people are comfortable
with acknowledging.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:84%
In the "Hospital" series, the
"Haunted Hospitals," what story

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.852 align:middle line:84%
rings out for you that you
just will never forget?

00:16:16.852 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Oh, that is
a terrific question.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It's one that my friend Kimm
Anderson brought to the show.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Kimm runs a haunted
house in Tooele, Utah.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And he does this for
the local children.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So this town has a community
of kids that really don't

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.488 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of options as--

00:16:35.488 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they want to go to
haunted houses for fun, right?

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Well, when
I say haunted house,

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean the kind of
Halloween attraction

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.887 align:middle line:90%
where you go to scare people.

00:16:42.887 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And so these kids work
in the haunted house.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And so he bought
the local hospital

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:84%
when it shut down and
turned it into a haunt.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.327 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And the people
that left, they just

00:16:53.327 --> 00:16:54.410 align:middle line:90%
closed the doors and left.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
They left the beds, they
left the X-ray machines.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They just
got out of there.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: They just
literally locked the doors

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and walked out because
a newer hospital

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:90%
had opened in the neighborhood.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't long before he
started running this place,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and people started
saying things like,

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:84%
we loved your haunted house,
but the doctor in the emergency

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.490 align:middle line:90%
department seemed really angry.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Like, really inappropriately
angry with us.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And he would have to say,
I didn't put a doctor

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.345 align:middle line:90%
in the emergency department.

00:17:18.345 --> 00:17:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And then they would start
talking about a little girl who

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.250 align:middle line:90%
was seen in the hallways.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And they would say,
she's a little young

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.268 align:middle line:84%
to be working in a place
like this, don't you think?

00:17:28.268 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this
was a little girl

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.780 align:middle line:84%
that had died in the
hospital many years before.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And nine months of the
year, George, this hospital

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:90%
is just shut down.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:90%
It's abandoned.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:90%
It's quiet.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Then around September,
people start coming in

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:84%
for the Halloween
season, and they're all

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:84%
coming in with the
intent of getting scared.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of energy
that this brings in I think

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.947 align:middle line:84%
allows the spirits of
the hospital to manifest.

00:17:49.947 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: So I always
spend Halloween week

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:90%
locked in that hospital.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.402 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing the same this year.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:90%
that they turned into a movie.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.990 align:middle line:84%
The exorcism occurred
in St. Louis, Missouri,

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
at a hospital called
the Alexian Brothers

Hospital, which is no more.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But in that room where
they had the exorcism,

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:84%
they decided, the hospital,
as it was closing down,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
to sell off the furniture
that was in that room.

The bed, the little bureau,
and stuff like that.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.500 align:middle line:90%

is that paramedics, EMTs,

all trained to keep
their heads in a crisis.

these apparitions that

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.490 align:middle line:90%
are so scary to so many people?

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: I think that,
again, we fear the unknown.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
these sorts of phenomena,

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
you can watch as many movies
as you like, read as many books

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:90%
as you like.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
You never truly believe
until it happens to you.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, deep down
at a visceral level,

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:84%
you don't truly believe this
stuff until it happens to you.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So those that do
see apparitions,

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:84%
it rocks the foundation
of their world.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:84%
It changes the way they look
at everything, fundamentally.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And for some, it's a
source of great fear.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.353 align:middle line:84%
But once that fear goes away,
many of these folks I talk to,

00:23:04.353 --> 00:23:06.020 align:middle line:84%
they'll tell me their
life is actually--

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.700 align:middle line:90%
their worldview is broadened.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's been your
experience with the folks you--

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing too.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:90%

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: It does.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And again, you know, you
can believe in many things,

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
but until there's
that visceral gut

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:22.340 align:middle line:84%
punch of it happening to
you, you won't truly believe.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:90%

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, you know,
don't quote me on this.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I figured
you would believe me.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had an EMT
caller a couple years ago

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:90%
who was driving in her car.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.040 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't on duty.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Came across an accident and
saw a body outside of the car.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was a single
car accident.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:90%
And she jumped out, and she's--

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, her cell
phone's in her car.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:90%
She's looking at the body.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
She sees somebody standing
on the side of the road,

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:84%
screaming at him,
going, call 911, please.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Call 911.

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.160 align:middle line:84%
She realized again
that was the body.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
He'd already died and was
ghostly, standing on the side,

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.550 align:middle line:90%
just watching.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.675 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: I wrote a book
called "Haunted Healthcare"

00:24:45.675 --> 00:24:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and talked to a nurse that was
involved with a resuscitation

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.500 align:middle line:84%
in which a-- it's
a very sad story--

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.295 align:middle line:84%
the driver of a car had
hit a family of four and--

00:24:55.295 --> 00:24:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, god.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.918 align:middle line:90%
And he had been killed.

00:24:57.918 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
The driver had been killed,
as had members of the family.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And as the nurses,
physicians, and technicians

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
in the ED, the
Emergency Department,

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.310 align:middle line:84%
were resuscitating one
of the family members,

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:84%
some but not all of them noticed
a gentleman standing back

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.100 align:middle line:84%
against the far wall
of the emergency room.

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There he was.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.018 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: And that's it.

00:25:18.018 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So they all assumed, maybe this
is just a family member that

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.520 align:middle line:90%
came in or was in the car.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.630 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to you later.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.692 align:middle line:90%
We're working here.

00:25:24.692 --> 00:25:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was only
later they realized

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:84%
it was the driver of the car
that hit the family whose

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.520 align:middle line:84%
body was in the room
next door and had just

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.450 align:middle line:90%
been pronounced dead.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.910 align:middle line:90%
That's just real stuff.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:35.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And what fascinates me is,
why do only half of the people

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.470 align:middle line:84%
in the room notice this
guy, and why do half not?

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Because we still don't know
how people see ghosts, George.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: I'm actually
of the opinion

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:90%
that we don't see them at all.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.275 align:middle line:84%
I think we perceive them
by some other means.

00:25:51.275 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people are
more sensitive than others

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.698 align:middle line:90%
and they pick up on this.

00:25:54.698 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
How many books do
you have out there?

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: It's 20-something now.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm embarrassed to give you--

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 20-some books?

00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:90%
How are you so prolific?

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: I love to write.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.830 align:middle line:90%
I write every day.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't sleep well unless I've
written about thousand words.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.855 align:middle line:84%
But the secret is it doesn't
feel like work to me, you know?

00:26:11.855 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm living these adventures
in haunted locations,

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.052 align:middle line:84%
and then I get to come and
just recall them for people

00:26:18.052 --> 00:26:19.010 align:middle line:90%
that want to read them.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
all haunted-related?

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Until this year, yeah.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:84%
They've all been
haunted-related.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I just finished my first
non-paranormal book,

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
which is a big 150,000-word
overview of some

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:90%
of the world's serial killers.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And my newest
contracted project is

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:90%
a history of the US military.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:38.780 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: No ghosts there.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe I'll sneak one in.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So the subject matter,
the hauntings that you go on

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:90%
then turn into books primarily?

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I like to move into a
haunted location if possible,

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.060 align:middle line:84%
spend several days
there around the clock.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
It's my belief--
and I learned this

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:84%
back in fire academy
many years ago.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Firefighters will tell you,
the enemy is not the fire,

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:90%
it's the building.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:84%
The building is
what'll kill you.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.040 align:middle line:90%
It's your battleground.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:03.957 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:27:03.957 --> 00:27:06.665 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: So firefighters
study construction.

00:27:06.665 --> 00:27:09.040 align:middle line:84%
We're interested in the way
air moves through a building.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.545 align:middle line:84%
We're interested in
how buildings behave.

00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:11.837 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What the floor's like.

00:27:11.837 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Exactly, yeah.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:84%
The camber of the floor,
the way things are laid out.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a good
24 hours in a place

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.473 align:middle line:84%
to understand a
structure, you know?

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:22.890 align:middle line:84%
We've got some hot
days right now.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:90%
It's June.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So buildings like this will heat
up today, and then tonight when

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:90%
it cools, they'll contract.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:29.460 align:middle line:90%
They'll creak.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Phantom footsteps on
the floor above you,

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.480 align:middle line:84%
except it's just the
house contracting.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So I like to do that
for my first 24 hours,

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:37.920 align:middle line:90%
just get to know the building.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Then we have a
baseline to start testing

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.630 align:middle line:90%
some of these anomalous claims.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if it's not the
house contracting, but actually

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.680 align:middle line:90%
footsteps?

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: That's why
we're really there.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I would tell you
frankly that 90%

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.700 align:middle line:84%
of my time as a paranormal
investigator is wasted.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.250 align:middle line:84%
I spend 90% of my time
waiting for 10% to happen.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: You know?

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But that 10%
makes it worth waiting for.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And that
honestly parallels my time

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.750 align:middle line:84%
in the fire service and
in emergency medicine.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:84%
90% of what we do is
not a true emergency.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But the 10% that is
makes it rewarding work,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.150 align:middle line:90%
more rewarding work.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you get a call
sometimes and you just

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.205 align:middle line:84%
get there and go,
why did they call us?

00:28:19.205 --> 00:28:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: You know,
I'll tell you.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Most paramedics do.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.420 align:middle line:84%
But the way to look at
this, and the reason

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.835 align:middle line:84%
that I've done this
for 17 years now

00:28:26.835 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and will hopefully go
on to do it much longer

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.570 align:middle line:84%
is that there is no such
thing as an unimportant call.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:84%
It might not be an
emergency to me--

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But it may not be
important to you.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: But it
may-- yeah, exactly.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But it becomes
important, because I

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:84%
would say the most important
thing I ever do in medicine

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.432 align:middle line:90%
is hold a lonely person's hand.

00:28:44.432 --> 00:28:45.890 align:middle line:84%
They call us because
it's the worst

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.240 align:middle line:90%
day they're ever going to have.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
privilege of trying

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:53.330 align:middle line:84%
to make that better, or at
least suck a little bit less.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.517 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they ever follow
up and thank you and find you?

00:28:56.517 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: I'll be
shopping in the store

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.083 align:middle line:84%
and someone will come
up to me and say hello.

00:29:01.083 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And it will take me
a moment to realize,

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.190 align:middle line:84%
the last time I saw them they
were significantly unwell.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:90%
It does happen.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Medicine is a rewarding job.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.030 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think of serial killers?

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: I think they're are
a lot more prevalent than we

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:90%
give credit for.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The FBI says
there are many wandering

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.405 align:middle line:90%
this planet right now.

00:29:20.405 --> 00:29:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Yeah, and the
smart ones, of course,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.867 align:middle line:90%
don't get caught.

00:29:23.867 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's the ones
that get away with it

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.585 align:middle line:84%
that are perhaps the most
interesting and alarming.

00:29:28.585 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Recently,
I had a chance

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.360 align:middle line:84%
to interview a
conspiracy researcher,

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Olav Phillips, about
the Zodiac killer.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.765 align:middle line:84%
And he had some astounding
things to tell us.

00:29:38.765 --> 00:29:41.612 align:middle line:10%
What other strange occurrences
when you were investigating?

00:29:41.612 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:10%
>>OLAV PHILLIPS:
We had flashlights

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.020 align:middle line:10%
that would turn on and off.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:10%
We actually got to a
point where we had set up

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.280 align:middle line:10%
a series of flashlights, and
we could ask him questions

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.040 align:middle line:10%
and get him to turn the
flashlights on and off.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.532 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And you
felt his presence?

00:29:56.532 --> 00:29:58.740 align:middle line:10%
>> PHILLIPS: The temperature--
once he became active,

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.528 align:middle line:10%
the temperature in the place
dropped by at least 15 degrees.

00:30:01.528 --> 00:30:03.570 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Of all the suspects
that are out there--

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:10%
and like I said, there's
a handful of them--

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:10%
would you say that he might
have been the biggest suspect?

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.650 align:middle line:10%
>> PHILLIPS: Listening to
him talk on the SB7, I mean,

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:10%
it's very pointed.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.440 align:middle line:10%
He says, I am the Zodiac.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.290 align:middle line:10%
He was very clear.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:10%
And all the communications
that we had through the SB7

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:10%
were in other ways
that were very clear.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:10%
His intent was very clear.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:10%
When I was in that building--

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:10%
and it's not a big building.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:10%
But when I was in
that building--

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And that
building's still there?

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:35.000 align:middle line:10%
>> PHILLIPS: The
building's still there.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.670 align:middle line:10%
Yep.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.370 align:middle line:10%
And the newspaper's
still in the building.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.287 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Did it scare
you when you were there?

00:30:39.287 --> 00:30:40.273 align:middle line:10%
>> PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:30:40.273 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And you
don't get scared.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:42.650 align:middle line:10%
>> PHILLIPS: No.

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:46.350 align:middle line:10%
More than any haunted
location I've ever been to,

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:47.610 align:middle line:10%
you could just feel it.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Evil.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.450 align:middle line:10%
>> PHILLIPS: You could
feel the malevolence.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Pure evil.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:10%
>> PHILLIPS: And when
he was doing things,

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.120 align:middle line:10%
he was messing with you.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.490 align:middle line:10%
And you knew that he
was messing with you.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.870 align:middle line:10%
You knew that he was
there and he wanted--

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.037 align:middle line:10%
he was after you.

00:31:05.037 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you feel pure evil,
Richard, sometimes when you're

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.070 align:middle line:90%
in these situations?

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: You know, I didn't
used to see it that way, George.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But I've worked a number
of cases in which I

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:90%
start to question that.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps the most recent one--

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and I can kind of report a
similar experience to Olav--

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:84%
was in the Villisca Ax
Murder House in Iowa,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.580 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the books
I'm finishing this year.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not familiar
with those murders,

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.350 align:middle line:84%
this is the story that
actually knocked the Titanic

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:84%
off the front pages
of US newspapers.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Somebody--

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a huge story.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: It was massive.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Person or persons--
there is a debate--

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:43.440 align:middle line:84%
unknown walked into a house in
this tiny town, Villisca, Iowa,

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and took the family's
own ax from the woodpile.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It's believed the killer
was hiding in the barn.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Broke in after the
family had gone to bed,

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.270 align:middle line:84%
murdered the parents in their
bed, and then six children

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.445 align:middle line:90%
also, all with this ax.

00:31:57.445 --> 00:31:59.070 align:middle line:84%
The Villisca Ax Murder
House is kind of

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.768 align:middle line:84%
unique in that most
scenes of murders

00:32:01.768 --> 00:32:02.810 align:middle line:90%
like that are demolished.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.720 align:middle line:90%
They're pulled down.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But that house stands pretty
much today as it was then.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What a horrible story.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: It is a
horrible story, and there

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.030 align:middle line:84%
is a theory that's
quite well regarded,

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.160 align:middle line:84%
the man from the
train theory, which

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:19.140 align:middle line:84%
posits that this was a hobo
riding the rails across the US.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And in those days, police
departments and jurisdictions

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.130 align:middle line:90%
didn't talk to one another.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.390 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't have computers.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Right.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So the concept of
a serial killer

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:28.590 align:middle line:90%
really wasn't well known then.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But there were a series of very
similar murders, all of them

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.090 align:middle line:84%
very close to railroad
tracks, heading

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.370 align:middle line:84%
across the US, and one of
them kind of local to us

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:90%
here in Colorado Springs.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Always the family killed
with their own hatchet.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Always every reflective
surface-- windows,

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.060 align:middle line:84%
mirrors inside the
house-- covered up.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Always an assault upon the
most attractive female member

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.570 align:middle line:90%
of the house.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.687 align:middle line:84%
The parallels are
very well regarded.

00:32:51.687 --> 00:32:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But most of those
properties are gone.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Villisca, you can
still visit today,

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and I spent several days
and nights researching that.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And there is something
about that house

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.400 align:middle line:90%
that is not quite right.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.555 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you the
modern day Truman Capote?

00:33:06.555 --> 00:33:07.355 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:33:07.355 --> 00:33:08.800 align:middle line:84%
This sounds like
"In Cold Blood."

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: I would
not be so arrogant

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:84%
as to presume to be at
his standard of writing.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But I find that the story
of Villisca fascinates me.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:84%
You go to the cemetery
in town, and all eight

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.270 align:middle line:90%
of those poor victims are--

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.235 align:middle line:84%
their graves are in one
long, continuous plot.

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
a horrible story.

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Yeah, and nobody has
ever answered for that crime.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.772 align:middle line:84%
They did not catch
any perpetrator.

00:33:29.772 --> 00:33:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would that
person still be alive

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.200 align:middle line:90%
or they'd be dead by now?

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Not right-- no.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.090 align:middle line:84%
No, they would not
be alive any longer.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.050 align:middle line:84%
This was back in
the early 1900s,

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.260 align:middle line:90%
so they got away with it.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
theories about-- just as

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.430 align:middle line:90%
with the Zodiac killings.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Zodiac could, I guess, be
in a nursing home right now.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He could be.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.220 align:middle line:84%
The Villisca murderer
is long dead and gone.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Or murderers.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.145 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were there other
cases similar to that

00:33:51.145 --> 00:33:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that you might have been able to
tie together with that murder?

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: With the
Villisca murders?

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, there were several.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you
plot them out--

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.820 align:middle line:84%
there is a great
book I recommend

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.500 align:middle line:84%
called "The Man From
the Train," which

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.950 align:middle line:90%
lays all of this stuff out.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:06.120 align:middle line:84%
It was written by a
baseball statistician

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.040 align:middle line:84%
of all things whose hobby
was looking at stats

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.165 align:middle line:84%
and then realized, there's
a pattern here emerging.

00:34:11.165 --> 00:34:12.498 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's something here.

00:34:12.498 --> 00:34:14.469 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: These ax murders
spread across the US,

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.280 align:middle line:90%
tracking railroad.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So this hobo, as they would
call them, jumped on the train,

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:25.570 align:middle line:84%
went to a city, did his heinous
deeds, jumped on a train

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.056 align:middle line:84%
again, went to another city
and did it all over again.

00:34:28.056 --> 00:34:29.139 align:middle line:90%
And they never caught him.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:29.939 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Right.

00:34:29.939 --> 00:34:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And it scarred the
town of Villisca.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for the longest time,
people believed it was a local.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.143 align:middle line:84%
And so there were stories
of whole families--

00:34:38.143 --> 00:34:40.060 align:middle line:84%
so you would get together
with your neighbors,

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.449 align:middle line:84%
because they feared
this would happen again.

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet they
were petrified.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Right.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the fathers
would take it in turns

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.715 align:middle line:84%
to sit up at night
with a shotgun.

00:34:46.715 --> 00:34:48.340 align:middle line:84%
You would have two
families in a house.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.962 align:middle line:84%
They would sleep in shifts,
two hours on, two hours off.

00:34:50.962 --> 00:34:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Dad would sit up with a
shotgun, waiting for somebody

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:54.159 align:middle line:90%
to break in.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:84%
They never understood
that this was

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:84%
a stranger that came in, struck
one night, and then moved on.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's the
target date for this book?

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.063 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: This book will be
out in November of this year.

00:35:03.063 --> 00:35:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I have one more visit to
pay to Villisca, which I'll

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.540 align:middle line:90%
be doing at the end of July.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it feel
creepy when you're there?

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: It absolutely does.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And I recorded the
last time I was there.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I was with two other
grown men in the house,

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and we recorded the sound
of children laughing.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Laughing.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Laughing.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not crying.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: No.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:23.923 align:middle line:90%
Giggling, laughing children.

00:35:23.923 --> 00:35:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That freaks me out.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Freaked me out.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Children sounds
of ghosts freak me out.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.670 align:middle line:90%
They're kids.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.437 align:middle line:90%
But they just sound eerie.

00:35:33.437 --> 00:35:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Definitely, I
would agree with you.

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And we had similar unusual
phenomena with flashlights.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is an old
technique with Maglites,

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.820 align:middle line:84%
those magnetic flashlights
where you unscrew them

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.170 align:middle line:90%
to a certain level.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.630 align:middle line:84%
That's been pretty
effectively debunked.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's proven that as the current
passes through the flashlight,

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.287 align:middle line:84%
it will expand and
contract, and therefore you

00:35:52.287 --> 00:35:53.120 align:middle line:90%
get that flickering.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So I don't put much
stock in Maglites,

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.740 align:middle line:84%
but the electronic
LED flashlights,

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.590 align:middle line:84%
which have an On/Off button,
we were getting those switching

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.150 align:middle line:84%
themselves off and on in the
Villisca Ax Murder House,

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and that's a whole different
level of phenomenon

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.810 align:middle line:90%
that you can't explain.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What entity might
have been doing that?

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.973 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Well, here's the thing.

00:36:08.973 --> 00:36:10.650 align:middle line:84%
The killer didn't
die in the house.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.020 align:middle line:84%
The only people that
died in the house--

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point--

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Were the
innocents that lived there.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So a theory that I have,
one that we don't really

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.740 align:middle line:84%
give too much thought to,
is paranormal enthusiasts

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:25.060 align:middle line:84%
such as myself, people that go
to all of these locations, many

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.630 align:middle line:90%
of them go to Villisca.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes we take
along attachments with us.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:34.210 align:middle line:84%
I think in the same way that you
can dirt into somebody's house

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.520 align:middle line:84%
if you go visit, you don't
wipe your feet properly--

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You bring something in.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
much of this activity

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:42.670 align:middle line:84%
may be unrelated to what
took place at the house.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There seems to be a lot
of sadness connected to it too.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: There is.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And sleeping in that house
is not a pleasant experience.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.333 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've done that?

00:36:49.333 --> 00:36:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: I have.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
If you go upstairs to
the master bedroom--

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and it's an open plan bedroom
at the top of the stairs--

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.640 align:middle line:84%
there are a series of
nicks on the ceiling.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a moment
before you realize that was

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:90%
from the back swing of the ax.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they kept
these things intact?

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: It's in the
ceiling of the house.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.495 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:07.495 --> 00:37:08.763 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fix the ceiling.

00:37:08.763 --> 00:37:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: But you know, then
you're changing history,

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and I think there's a lot to be
said for preserving something

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:15.265 align:middle line:84%
like this for
future generations.

00:37:15.265 --> 00:37:17.598 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's why they
have kept it the way it is.

00:37:17.598 --> 00:37:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: It's not the kind
of place you enjoy visiting,

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.590 align:middle line:90%
but it has its lessons.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Small house?

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.185 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Very, very small house.

00:37:25.185 --> 00:37:27.838 align:middle line:84%
I usually take two or no more
than three people with me

00:37:27.838 --> 00:37:29.130 align:middle line:90%
when I investigate in Villisca.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think they let
him in, or did he break in?

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Well, here's the thing.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.535 align:middle line:84%
One theory suggests that
he was hiding in the barn,

00:37:37.535 --> 00:37:39.660 align:middle line:84%
watching the family come
and go throughout the day.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Then they went to church.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So one theory says that he broke
in while they were at church,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:84%
waited in the attic, and then
came out when they were asleep.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Another says that he broke in
through a downstairs window,

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:54.420 align:middle line:84%
taking their ax
from the woodpile

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.860 align:middle line:90%
after they'd all gone to bed.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.007 align:middle line:84%
And a third theory says
that he had an accomplice.

00:37:59.007 --> 00:38:00.090 align:middle line:90%
But I will tell you this--

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.632 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now if he
had an accomplice,

00:38:01.632 --> 00:38:03.570 align:middle line:84%
this person traveled
with him all the time.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:05.438 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Exactly.

00:38:05.438 --> 00:38:06.480 align:middle line:90%
But I will tell you this.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.670 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to be
silent in that house.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Those old wooden balloon
frame buildings creak.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.470 align:middle line:84%
You cannot climb that
staircase quietly.

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: So it's a
mystery to me how

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:20.520 align:middle line:84%
he was able to do what
he did without waking

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.640 align:middle line:90%
the whole family up.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And whatever he
did, he had to do fast.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.870 align:middle line:84%
The screams alone would
wake up the other ones

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:28.670 align:middle line:90%
and they'd run out.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And then spent the
whole night in the house

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:31.720 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So the best guess is the
killings occurred sometime

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:36.560 align:middle line:84%
after midnight, and that he
left sometime before dawn.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So he was in the house
for several hours--

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With all
the dead bodies.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.085 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: --with all
of the dead bodies.

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:43.020 align:middle line:90%
And even cooked himself food.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Mm-hmm.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly a sick person.

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Absolutely.

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:50.287 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What creates
someone like that?

00:38:50.287 --> 00:38:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Well, this is the
great debate, isn't it?

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.657 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: It's the whole
nature versus nurture.

00:38:54.657 --> 00:38:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Are some people
just wired wrong?

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Are some people just born evil?

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:00.792 align:middle line:90%
Or is it a--

00:39:00.792 --> 00:39:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Something
happened to him.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Or is there an event
that happens which twists

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.770 align:middle line:90%
somebody, that corrupts them?

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Abused as a child
or something horrible.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: And I researched
so many serial killers

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.160 align:middle line:90%
for this book.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.640 align:middle line:84%
There are many defining
characteristics in childhood

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.345 align:middle line:90%
that they have in common.

00:39:16.345 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them-- the male serial
killers-- because they're

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.780 align:middle line:90%
predominantly male.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.580 align:middle line:90%
There are few--

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Most are.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.030 align:middle line:84%
There are a few, but some
female serial killers.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But many of them are
mommy's boys, you know?

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.720 align:middle line:90%
They were--

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like Ted Bundy.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:84%
They were doted upon by their
mothers to an unusual degree.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:36.780 align:middle line:90%
So there is that.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Early incidences of bedwetting
that go on late into childhood

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.240 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes adulthood.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.520 align:middle line:84%
But also a fundamental
lack of empathy, and I

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.830 align:middle line:84%
think that's to me the
defining characteristic.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:52.100 align:middle line:84%
To do what they do, you cannot
regard your victim as a person.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.493 align:middle line:90%
They dehumanize people.

00:39:53.493 --> 00:39:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They have to.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's the only way
for them to do what they do.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.200 align:middle line:84%
The way you and I might
carve up our lunch,

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.190 align:middle line:90%
they carve up people.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they ever
have real relationships?

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: I think
many of them become

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.700 align:middle line:84%
very good at faking
real relationships,

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.470 align:middle line:84%
but you also see those
that have this dual life.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:15.630 align:middle line:84%
When I investigated the haunting
of Fox Hollow Farm in Indiana,

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:18.680 align:middle line:84%
which was home of the I-70
strangler, Herb Baumeister,

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.190 align:middle line:84%
he murdered up to
19 men in that house

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and buried the bodies in
the woods behind the house.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.150 align:middle line:84%
He was a family man who I was
told by so many locals doted

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:30.220 align:middle line:90%
on his kids.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And they said, he'd give
you the shirt off his back.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.920 align:middle line:90%
He was the nicest guy, you know?

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.430 align:middle line:84%
He would help you with anything,
donate to charity, you name it.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like that
BTK killer in Wichita--

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:41.330 align:middle line:90%
was it--

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Yeah.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Dennis Rader, I believe.

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Well known
in his church.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.163 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Family would
have no idea he did this.

00:40:48.163 --> 00:40:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: It's
almost as if they're

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.383 align:middle line:84%
able to seal off that
aspect of their personality.

00:40:53.383 --> 00:40:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
you're forced

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.588 align:middle line:84%
to wonder, well, which is the
real mask, and which is them?

00:40:57.588 --> 00:40:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But they don't see it?

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.073 align:middle line:90%
The family doesn't see anything?

00:41:01.073 --> 00:41:03.740 align:middle line:10%
>>ESTEP: Well, you know, I mean,
looking at the Fox Hollow case,

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.860 align:middle line:10%
I have a lot of sympathy
for the killer's wife.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.710 align:middle line:10%
People said she must have known.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:10%
And he waited until
she would take weekends

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.550 align:middle line:10%
away with the children at
the lake to do the murders.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.020 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.870 align:middle line:10%
>>ESTEP: Most people, if your
spouse is acting strangely,

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:19.745 align:middle line:10%
yeah, you might have
some concerns, you know?

00:41:19.745 --> 00:41:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're having an affair.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have a problem, a
gambling problem or something.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.305 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A job problem.

00:41:24.305 --> 00:41:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ESTEP: Nobody ever thinks--

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're serial killers.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: --they're
serial killers.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants to think that.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.788 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: But also,
why would you?

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I have a lot of
sympathy for the families.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
track your work, Richard?

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Where do they find you?

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ESTEP: Well, George,
