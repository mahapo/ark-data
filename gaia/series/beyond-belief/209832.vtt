>>GEORGE NOORY: Were you born
with these mystic healing

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.140 align:middle line:90%
abilities?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SONJA GRACE: I've
been able to see

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.750 align:middle line:84%
all levels of the astral plane
since I was a little kid.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
time traveler as well?

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: When I
experience time travel,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:84%
it is a total physical
body experience.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We have moved into
the fifth dimension,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:90%
so it's a much higher frequency.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
It's much more intense,
and we as a species

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
have never navigated this
kind of energy before.

>>NOORY: Well, welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.070 align:middle line:10%
Sonja Grace with us, author,
mystic healer, spirit traveler.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.920 align:middle line:10%
She works with clients
from around the world,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:10%
but you do it in a
different way, don't you?

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: I do, George.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:10%
It's so good to see you.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You too.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: I work on
people long distance,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:10%
but time and space is
not the same for me

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.310 align:middle line:10%
as it is for most people.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:10%
So if someone's in Australia
clear around the other side

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:10%
of the globe from
me, I can still

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.503 align:middle line:10%
put myself in front of them
and work on them as if they

00:01:15.503 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:10%
were right here in the room.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do you do that?

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I always
have the funny story,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
because I was a classical
ballerina and danced

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.990 align:middle line:84%
professionally for years,
that when you train and you

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
learn how to do turns,
you have to count,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:90%
of course, your music.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And I always joke that
in the count of eight,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:84%
how many Chaine turns can you
get in that count of eight?

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And so you're literally
learning through movement

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:84%
how to change time because
you're arriving sooner

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:90%
or you're arriving later.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So I basically as a child and
growing up in a dance career,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I learned a different way of
moving through time and space.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you born with
these mystic healing abilities?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, I was.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
My earliest memories are of
my guide standing next to me,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:90%
having interaction with me.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.327 align:middle line:90%
They're high angelic beings.

00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you a
little girl at the time?

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, I was a baby.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:84%
My earliest memory
was two years old.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.133 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was working on
our animals on the farm

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.353 align:middle line:90%
that I lived on at five--

00:02:22.353 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's where
got your practice.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: At five years
old, I was trying

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:90%
to dissolve tumors on our dog.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And did you succeed?

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, I did.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you know
what you were doing?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, I did.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And my childhood was
really challenging

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:90%
because I was seeing everything.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
I could see just
like I do today.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
See it, hear it, feel it, smell
it, and weirdly taste things

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And I have this constant
barrage of spiritual beings

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and ghosts and people coming
through, and it was tough.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my childhood-- thank
god I grew up on a farm

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
because then I had the Earth
and the grounding of being

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:90%
in that environment.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had
a way to escape.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you a
time traveler as well?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.477 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about that.

00:03:11.477 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:90%
What is time travel to you?

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, time
travel to me is

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:84%
different than what most people
in the spiritual community

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:90%
would understand.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
The understanding is
astral projection,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.430 align:middle line:84%
and that's not
what happens to me.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I go into a very deep
state of meditation.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And George, I've been meditating
and teaching meditation

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:84%
for 41 years now, so
I have a completely

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:84%
different relationship
to that experience.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
one when you started?

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: So I had an
experience at one point,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe, I don't know,
25, 30 years ago where

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:84%
I went into
meditation, and my body

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
started to dissolve like
little grains of sand.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a
teleportation device.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, it just dissolved.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Like I became one with
everything in the room.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that point that
my guides held their hand out

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And I took their
hand, and we went up.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And we went up and
up and up all the way

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the universe.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're doing
this on a regular basis now?

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, no.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I spirit travel when
I'm asked by my guides

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:84%
to look at something or share
information with people.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.933 align:middle line:84%
I don't just go, OK, I'm
going to go here today.

00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You don't do that--

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Plus I'm working
so hard with clients.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you do
that if you wanted to?

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I'm so busy.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you do it
at will if you wanted to?

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: If I ask
my guides, would you

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
take me to Stonehenge or
wherever, they will comply.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time,
it's their suggestion

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.363 align:middle line:90%
of where they want me to be.

00:04:54.363 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are some of the
requirements for time travel

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.300 align:middle line:90%
that you must be able to do?

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: George, honestly,
I think that time travel

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and what happened to me was
a result of years of practice

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:90%
and being in meditation.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
it's something

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:90%
for everyone to be able to do.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful that I can do it,
but there's a lot of danger

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:90%
out there too.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And I've been to
different places

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
around the world in
different time periods

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that I've looked at my
guides and said, get me out

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.958 align:middle line:90%
of here because it's scary.

00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is scary sometimes.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia
program, "Healing Matrix,"

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Julia Mossbridge talks about
one very important component

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.035 align:middle line:90%
to time travel.

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:10%
>>JULIA MOSSBRIDGE: Yes, I
think not only is it related.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:10%
I think it's related in two
ways that are really important.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
It's related in one way on
the application side, which

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
is if you're going to--
let's say we invent

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:90%
actual physical time travel.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:84%
That also includes
mental time travel.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So the whole shebang, like
the science fiction version

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.837 align:middle line:84%
where you take your self,
your body, and your memories,

00:05:54.837 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and your personality
somewhere else in time.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.845 align:middle line:90%
Let's say we invent that.

00:05:57.845 --> 00:05:58.645 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE MORTER: Yeah.

00:05:58.645 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSSBRIDGE: So assume
it's not impossible.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:90%
In a world such as we live--

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
in which we live today,
in this world, doing that

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
is going to cause
all sorts of problems

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:84%
because it's an
egoic world that's

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:84%
driven by a lot of fear
and scarcity, et cetera.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And so you could see the
problems that would emerge.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And so if you also have people
understanding more and more

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:84%
around the world that there's
this unconditional love

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and connection with
oneself over time,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:90%
that is the most powerful thing.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:84%
More powerful than
hate or anything else.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:84%
If you have both of
those understandings,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
then this time
travel peace will be

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.057 align:middle line:84%
used for something that will
be beneficial to humanity, not

00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:84%
just the person who's
using it, right?

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that's an
application side,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:84%
but then there's a
technical side, which

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:84%
is in terms of discovering
physical time travel along

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:84%
with mental time travel
and really operationalizing

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.898 align:middle line:84%
that in a process
that really works,

00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I think you're
actually going to need

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.710 align:middle line:84%
some insights from the
consciousness side that says,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:84%
yes, consciousness is actually
this nonlocal primary thing,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:90%
force, field, whatever it is.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
mathematically scientifically

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
technically true about how
that works that we don't quite

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.553 align:middle line:84%
know yet that that's going to
give us information about how

00:07:21.553 --> 00:07:22.470 align:middle line:90%
to do the time travel.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think in both the
application and the technology,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
I think you need
that connection.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MORTER: And how fascinating
that unconditional love

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.720 align:middle line:90%
is the melding ingredient.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is
required for the most

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
effective and efficient
use of time travel.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting because it
is also the most important

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.730 align:middle line:84%
ingredient when someone
is truly attempting

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to access higher levels of
their own consciousness.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:84%
This quality of
unconditional love.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a vibrational frequency
that is bridging the world, so

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:90%
to speak.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You and Julia make
it sound easy to time travel.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I
wouldn't call it easy

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
because I do experience the
cold, I experience wind,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:90%
I experience the elements.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.207 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times before I go, I
put a coat on because I know--

00:08:12.207 --> 00:08:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Because I know
I may be going someplace

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.245 align:middle line:90%
where it's really cold.

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.703 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And when I
come back, George,

00:08:18.703 --> 00:08:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I think I've only been longed
for maybe 20 30 minutes,

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.645 align:middle line:84%
and the clock is like
four hours later.

00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hours later.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.062 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: So I have
to be careful when

00:08:28.062 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I go because I work
with clients all day

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:90%
long doing healing work.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I can't take a half an hour
break because my guides want

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:90%
to take me somewhere.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I've got to
have time available.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you ever
miss the past much?

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: The past is mostly
where I have time travelled to.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I am not a person to readily
run off into the future,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:84%
although a lot of people want
to know about what's going

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:90%
to happen in the future, right?

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: We all want to know.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.648 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We all want to know.

00:08:58.648 --> 00:09:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: But when
we look to the past,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
we can figure that
out very easily.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.176 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you alter
the past, and can you?

00:09:07.176 --> 00:09:07.976 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No.

00:09:07.976 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You cannot.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
just witness things

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
that are happening but
you can't get involved?

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Correct.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm just witnessing it.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could you alter
it if you wanted to?

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, well, first
of all, I wouldn't do that

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:90%
because that's not--

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not you.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: That's not my style.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.015 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some people would.

00:09:24.015 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I know, I know.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's a dangerous landscape
that we live in spiritually

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.748 align:middle line:84%
because there's good intentions,
there's bad intentions.

00:09:33.748 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
There's people who know
what they're doing,

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
there's people who don't
know what they're doing.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So as the world goes
through the centuries,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:90%
that's always been the case.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that what
was said about having

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.940 align:middle line:84%
this incredible
compassion and heart space

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.630 align:middle line:84%
is what allowed me in my
meditation to experience

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.820 align:middle line:90%
dissolving into nothing.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And once that
happened, then it's

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.547 align:middle line:84%
continued to happen
over the years.

00:10:02.547 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over again.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And I think I
want to keep going back

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:84%
to a really deep
meditation practice is

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
what is going to help all of
us to get where we need to be.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the Third,
Fourth, and Fifth Worlds?

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.765 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, according
to Hopi and the Hopi--

00:10:21.765 --> 00:10:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Native
American Hopi prophecy.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, tradition, yes.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle line:84%
There's four worlds that
we have lived in so far.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On this planet?

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:84%
The First World started
back when Earth was created.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: OK.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.410 align:middle line:84%
There were people that were
created in that First World

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.520 align:middle line:90%
by Grandmother Spider.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:90%
She's called [NON-ENGLISH].

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Grandmother Spider?

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Grandmother Spider
created the first people.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:49.837 align:middle line:90%
And when those people--

00:10:49.837 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is this like God?

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, no, the
God according to Hopi

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
is the Maasaw, and he
was the only one that

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:90%
was on Earth at the beginning.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And he had a torch,
because there was no light,

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and Grandmother
Spider was there.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
She created the
twins, the two twins

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that hold up the
Earth so that they

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:90%
could keep the poles balanced.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So that's world one.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: That's in
the First World.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:90%
So the people were created.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.280 align:middle line:84%
During that creation
there were the Hopi gods,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and through the
sun lighting up--

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:90%
which is Dawa, the sun--

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
there were rays of
light that came.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And on those rays of light
were these beings, really tall.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:84%
14 feet tall, blond
hair, blue eyes--

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Giants?

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Pleiadians.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadians are gods.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:90%
They're not aliens.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So the Pleiadians came
during this First World,

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and they helped they
worked with the Hopi gods.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:90%
So then the First World ended.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:84%
There was fire-- that's what
took it to its final end.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:84%
The Second World was created,
and that was even more--

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
like the people learned
songs, and they stood up,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:90%
and they started to dance.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And there was an evolutionary
process of the Hopi people.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:90%
That ended in floods.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Then the third World
happened, and the Third World

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:90%
was even more advanced.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And this was a time
where the people started

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:84%
to bring in not only the
ceremonies but put all of it

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did something
dramatic happened

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:90%
during the Third World?

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: The Third World ended
when the comets hit the Earth

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:90%
12,800 BC.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis, Lemuria, Aztlán.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wiped out everything.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: All of
them fell, correct.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the significance

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:84%
of what is called the kivas for
the Hopis and Pueblo people?

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: The kivas
are the round chambers

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:90%
that are built underground.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They're all over Chaco
Canyon, the four corners.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.163 align:middle line:84%
There's kivas in
ancient ruins site.

00:12:52.163 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
their purposes, Sonja?

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They're for
the people to practice,

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:90%
to pray, and to do ceremony in.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were they very
spiritual, these people?

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Very spiritual,
very connected.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:90%
In fact, the ancient people--

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I was really thinking
about this when

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.526 align:middle line:90%
I made the film "Hisatsinom."

00:13:14.526 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
The people were so
connected to the Earth.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:90%
They were so present, George.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a
phone in their hand.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a
television running.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.060 align:middle line:90%
They were so present.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And so anything that
they experienced

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:90%
was like right there.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:90%
It was immediate.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They had their
act together, didn't they?

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the Great Migration?

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, the
Great Migration

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the end
of the Third World.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:90%
There were floods.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Some people went underground.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.200 align:middle line:84%
The Ant People, the Savarak,
took them underground.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Some people went up.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians took
some people up,

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and some people migrated
North, South, East,

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:90%
West, in all directions.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your film,
"Spirit Traveler,"

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the ancient
people of the Southwest

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and the stories of
their Great Migration.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Stories of migration
are an intricate part

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.660 align:middle line:90%
of Pueblo cultures.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.890 align:middle line:84%
When the Third World
ended, great civilizations

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:90%
like Atlantis and Lemuria fell.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:10%
The area known as Aztlán, now
marked on the map as Cancun,

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.710 align:middle line:10%
Mexico, was the hub of
Indigenous people from all over

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:10%
North and South America.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:10%
Some of the ancient
people migrated

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:10%
before the comets hit
the Earth in 12,800 BC

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:10%
and started the long
trek North and South.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Some were washed away
in the Great Flood,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:90%
and some were taken underground.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
The emergence from the
Sipapu in the Grand Canyon

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.330 align:middle line:84%
was the indication that the
Fourth World was beginning.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
When it was safe to
emerge, the people

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.685 align:middle line:84%
climbed out of the Sipapu
into the Grand Canyon.

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The direction of
where people migrated

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:90%
was according to the clans.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Each clan was
reliant on signs that

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.740 align:middle line:90%
led them to their destination.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Pictographs of bear paws,
birds, and other clan deities

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:90%
cover the migration trail.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:84%
It was the highly initiated
men who carved the stories

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:90%
into the walls of the Canyon.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:84%
In essence, the migration
of the Fourth World

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:84%
looks like a basket with trails
woven throughout the Southwest.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:84%
What is recorded in
pictographs and petroglyphs

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.160 align:middle line:84%
is reflecting the times of what
was important to the people.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Depictions of gods and spiritual
deities, spirals, plans,

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and migration patterns are
found throughout the Southwest.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Handprints that cover the
walls show how many people

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.690 align:middle line:84%
are living there,
marking initiations

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:90%
and rites of passage.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is
there a Fifth World?

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And what is that?

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, that's
where we're headed.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're not there yet.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.425 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: We're
not there yet, no.

00:15:58.425 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is why in the
spiritual community,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:84%
so many people are
rushing to kind of get

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual groove on
because everybody feels it.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what religion or
what spiritual practice you're

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:90%
in, everybody is feeling this.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
We've got people buying
property all over the world.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Crazy traveling, moving.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.890 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of changes
that people internally feel,

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's because we're
coming to the end

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:90%
of this phase of humanity.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that a good thing?

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, yeah,
of course, of course.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:84%
This isn't about, oh no,
it's all coming to an end

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:90%
and we all have to be scared.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this is
not end times prophecy?

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.073 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, no, no.

00:16:38.073 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:84%
This is about transition and
evolution of our species.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So when the Fourth
World ends, yeah, there

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:84%
might be some Earth events
that mark that time--

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Still could be.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: But the Fifth
World will begin.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And our children, our
grandchildren, they're

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.430 align:middle line:84%
the ones that will herald
the next phase of humanity.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will there
be a Sixth World?

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.615 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I believe there will.

00:17:01.615 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Then it goes on and on.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I really
believe, George,

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that we are so
multidimensional, that we

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
have all these different
dimensions that we're

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:90%
experiencing.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Timelines, my god,
timelines have

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:84%
literally almost disintegrated
the boundaries between them.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching people
experience things

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:84%
from different times and
different time periods,

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and they don't understand
what's happening,

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's because we have moved
into the Fifth Dimension.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's a much higher frequency.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:84%
It's much more intense,
and we as a species

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:84%
have never navigated this
kind of energy before.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonja, how did
the ancients know this?

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:90%
How did they get this knowledge?

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They were not
blocked and confused

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:84%
by all of the things that we
have blocking and confusing us

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you just look at
it on an electromagnetic--

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.117 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, we're
confused just about every--

00:17:59.117 --> 00:18:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Level-- well,
we've got 5G going.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.820 align:middle line:84%
We've got all kinds of
weird energies coming in.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.610 align:middle line:90%
We've got phones in our hands.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.390 align:middle line:84%
We have all of this
technology that's fantastic,

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:90%
but it is taking people offline.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.635 align:middle line:84%
They're not listening to their
inner truth, their inner voice.

00:18:18.635 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
your motivation

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:90%
behind "Spirit Traveler?"

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I wanted to
show people the natural world.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to connect people back
to what the Hopi people knew

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:90%
and what they still know today.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to show people
how these ancient sites can

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
connect us to what's going
to happen in the future.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who were the Ant
People in Hopi prophecy?

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: The Ant People
were the ones who

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:90%
helped the people underground.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.820 align:middle line:84%
They created tunnels
all over the world

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.283 align:middle line:90%
and took the people into safety.

00:18:53.283 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they there now?

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.062 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big is
the civilization?

00:18:58.062 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well,
there's quite a few,

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.747 align:middle line:84%
but they live way
underground, so--

00:19:01.747 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In caverns?

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, caverns, tunnels.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.688 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
they do for light?

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: They have lamps.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm kidding.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They might.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:90%
They might.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: No, there is a
source of light that comes in,

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.860 align:middle line:10%
and these beings have
been here on Earth

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:10%
since the beginning of Earth.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:84%
They came from the same part of
the universe as the Hopi gods,

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:90%
as the Egyptian gods.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:90%
They're dialed in to all of it.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How far advanced were
they then compared to us today?

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they didn't have
computers, as you said.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have that
kind of technology,

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:84%
but they had something
else, didn't they?

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: They did.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe through their
spiritual practice

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and what they connected to,
they were much more advanced,

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.490 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't
take it where we've

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:90%
taken it through technology.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:84%
They took it into their
actual spiritual practice.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where did
aliens fit in with this?

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.123 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, aliens.

00:20:03.123 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they out there?

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They've been a part
of our human development

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
since 20 million years ago
when our species arrived.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there is an amazing
connection to alien influence

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:90%
and where humans are at today.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:84%
In my film, I do talk
about the alien influence.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Did they interact much
with the ancients?

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, they did.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, George,
there's a story

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that I was told about Hopi,
where a long time ago,

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to say
like in the 1800s,

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.360 align:middle line:84%
there were stories passed
through the families of aliens.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking probably
Greys or small Greys,

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:50.122 align:middle line:84%
walking with people in the
villages holding their hands.

00:20:50.122 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're comfortable.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: There's all kinds
of stories like that.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where were their craft?

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well,
there's canyons there,

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and there's reports
of the crafts landing

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:90%
in these canyons.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Even my dad out there
saw a round spaceship

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:84%
like a flying saucer
with a globe on top,

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and it was right at
the end of the road.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And him and a friend, they
were about 10 and 12 years old,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.630 align:middle line:84%
laid on top of the ridge
watching this thing,

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and then they got really
scared and they ran home.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does Sedona
possess some kind

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:26.130 align:middle line:90%
of magical or mystical feeling?

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Sedona is like any
land on any reservation.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that live there.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:84%
There are energies
that live there.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And some of these things, we're
not supposed to tamper with.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:90%
We're not supposed to go near--

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's taboo--

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.228 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --so to speak.

00:21:46.228 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah,
because out at Hopi,

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't go to
Sedona to find these things.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:84%
We respect them and
leave them alone

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:90%
because they're very powerful.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a lot of the
spiritual community searching

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to go
find these energies.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But like in any
part of the world,

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.787 align:middle line:84%
you can also run into
some danger doing that.

00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:84%
How did you get
interested in this, Sonja?

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
That's not a field that you
wake up in the morning and say,

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to become a mystic
healer or I'm going to do this.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I had my
experiences through childhood,

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.830 align:middle line:84%
seeing all the ghosts
and spiritual beings

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and angels and demigods
coming into my house.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But as a dancer, I
kept finding myself

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:90%
going between those two worlds.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I'd be ready to go out
on stage, and there

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.998 align:middle line:84%
would be some ghost of that
theater standing there.

00:22:44.998 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I should have
you a little dance for us.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: But yeah, right?

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.082 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet you could do it.

00:22:49.082 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, no.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But there's such a time
where you reach a point

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.380 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
deny it any longer,

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:90%
and that's what happened to me.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
I could not deny the
gifts that I had and I

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.100 align:middle line:84%
had to do something about it or
I believe I would not be here.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How extensive have
you searched out and traveled

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:90%
in these areas?

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I've gone all the
way out into the universe.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:90%
I've--

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, I've spirit
traveled to some different

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:90%
places--

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like through
remote viewing?

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, actually
through time travel.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:90%
I've been taken--

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:27.743 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Physically?

00:23:27.743 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Physically
by my guides.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And remember, George, when
I experience time travel,

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:84%
it is a total physical
body experience.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not my mind or
astral projecting.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
get into that mode?

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I go into meditation.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I go into a very
deep meditation.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I do my grounding
meditation, and then my body

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:90%
starts to dissolve.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it
astral projection?

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: No, it's not.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And then my guides hold their
hands out, and they take me.

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And when I go, it is my
etheric body, my soul body

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:90%
that's going with them.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Out-of-body experiences
and astral projections

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:90%
are somewhat different.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.530 align:middle line:84%
They talk about it on
Gaia's program, "Microdose."

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:15.330 align:middle line:90%

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.497 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: Another experiment
by Janet Lee Mitchell

00:24:17.497 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:10%
and Karlis Osis studied
clairvoyant Ingo Swann

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:24.930 align:middle line:10%
and revealed that he
correctly identified eight out

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:10%
of eight target observations
while out of body.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.420 align:middle line:84%
The probability of this
occurring by chance

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:90%
was 1 in 40,000.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
In the general population,
about 1 in 10 people

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:84%
have claimed to have an
out-of-body experience

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.290 align:middle line:90%
at one point in their lives.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.330 align:middle line:84%
This experience of
leaving the body

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is called an Out-Of-Body
experience or OBE,

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:84%
which is sometimes described
as a separation of one's

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:84%
astral form from
their physical body.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:84%
This experience is
commonly referred

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.795 align:middle line:90%
to as astral projection.

00:24:56.795 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:10%
>>JASON QUITT: Once
I'm out of my body,

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:10%
there's no such thing
as time or space.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:10%
So we can jump
through timelines,

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.510 align:middle line:10%
we could jump
through dimensions,

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:10%
and there's many different
levels of experience

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.295 align:middle line:10%
in those realms.

00:25:08.295 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: But besides
having an experience where

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:14.280 align:middle line:84%
you can fly anywhere
or any time you want,

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the
other benefits you

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:90%
can get from this practice?

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:84%
According to a survey, 86% of
399 out-of-body participants

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.553 align:middle line:84%
had a greater
awareness of reality.

00:25:26.553 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM BUHLMAN: Your
whole reality changes.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Your perception of
reality changes.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.290 align:middle line:10%
What's important to you
changes, and your emphasis

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:10%
through life changes.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:10%
Your trajectory in life
changes because you're

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.385 align:middle line:10%
no longer obsessed with
the acquisition of things.

00:25:41.385 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Out-of-body
experiences,

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
as mystical as they might
seem, have scientific evidence

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.290 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that they
might be very real.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.230 align:middle line:84%
There are many claimed
benefits of the practice,

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:84%
but what seems to be universal
across all astral travel

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:84%
is learning more about your
personal human experience

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and the world that we
live in and beyond.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BUHLMAN: The old concepts
of body, mind, spirit

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.440 align:middle line:90%
are primitive and inaccurate.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.170 align:middle line:90%
We are multidimensional beings.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:84%
We exist on many
different dimensions.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you have an
out-of-body experience,

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:84%
you're shifting
your consciousness

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:84%
into an energy body that
is already an aspect of us,

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.912 align:middle line:90%
of all of us.

00:26:22.912 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Astral travel is a tool to
awaken ourselves so fully that

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:84%
we develop deeper connection
to our multidimensionality.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
We learn about ourselves
and our purpose,

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and we can take what
we learn from it

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and then put it into
service in this world.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the real difference

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:84%
between astral projection
and time travel?

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, as we saw in
the clip, astral traveler,

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:84%
astral projection is a way
to explore the universe

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.020 align:middle line:90%
and explore different things.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I always urge caution to
people because there's things

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
out there that you
don't want to run into--

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:90%
aliens, entities.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.730 align:middle line:84%
All of it exists in
the astral plane.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It is a very common use
of astral projecting.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:84%
In time travel I experience,
a whole body kind

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
of gone experience, where
my body is just a shell,

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and my soul is what leaves
and goes to those places.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.810 align:middle line:84%
That's even more
dangerous, and of course, I

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:84%
don't go without a whole lot
of protection with my guides.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if
you can't get back?

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I'm going
to try to call you.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Long distance.

00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: George,
come and get me.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.138 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, is that
conceivable, I mean,

00:27:39.138 --> 00:27:41.510 align:middle line:84%
that you time travel
and you can't get back?

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.123 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: That's why I'm so
careful about doing this.

00:27:44.123 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So it could happen.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And that's why I don't
promote that everybody learn

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.598 align:middle line:84%
how to astral project, because
even though it's a great tool--

00:27:53.598 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They may not be ready.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They may not be ready,
and that's a really big point.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:03.120 align:middle line:84%
When I time travel, like I
said to you, I'm very careful.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I only go where my guides
take me, and I am protected.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm protected.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a
difference between aliens,

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.490 align:middle line:90%
demigods, angels?

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yes, there
is a difference.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So in the astral
plane, that space that

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:84%
exists between us here and
heaven, the spirit realm,

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:84%
everything exists from
angels and demigods,

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:90%
which are the closest to God.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And then on down the line, you
have aliens, you have entities,

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:84%
you have demons,
smarmy, creepy things.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: So you have
everything that exists.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've been able to see all
levels of the astral plane

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:84%
since I was a little kid,
born with that ability.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So my experience
now is when I work,

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's been this since I
started working as a healer,

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.040 align:middle line:90%
I only work with angels.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I work and talk
with the demigods,

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.970 align:middle line:84%
but I don't interact with
entities or aliens or that kind

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:10.640 align:middle line:84%
of thing because their vibration
is not conducive to help me

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.860 align:middle line:90%
in helping people to heal.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they evil?

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: No, I think
aliens are like humans

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:90%
in that they have an agenda.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:84%
They come here for
water, they come here

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.370 align:middle line:90%
for natural resources--

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Minerals.

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They come
here for tissue sample

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:84%
because they want to
repopulate their species

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:90%
by making some kind of hybrid.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:90%
So they've got an agenda.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:90%
We have an agenda.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Humans are famous for
having an agenda, right?

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
communicating with aliens

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.750 align:middle line:84%
is very tricky because they
want something from humans.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And are you
prepared to give that up?

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Not at all, no.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:90%
I have very clear boundaries.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Me and aliens, huh-uh,
no, there's a boundary.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.350 align:middle line:90%
You're over there, I'm here.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.733 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do
you live these days?

00:30:00.733 --> 00:30:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: In Arizona.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.712 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On a reservation?

00:30:03.712 --> 00:30:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: We're just a couple
of hours from the reservation.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why are you there?

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.345 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I'm
married to a Hopi man.

00:30:09.345 --> 00:30:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, are you?

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And Shawn and our families
are on the reservation

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:90%
so we're close--

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does he still
practice the Hopi tradition?

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, he does.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
great point, George.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So many people who saw
"Dances with Wolves"

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.870 align:middle line:84%
believed that Native Americans
ended when that movie was over.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: And that's not true.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.903 align:middle line:84%
Native people are
alive and well.

00:30:31.903 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
wonderful people.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And the
ceremonies are going on,

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and everybody still
practices their traditions.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted people
to really hear

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that because I feel
that a lot of times,

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:84%
their cultures and their
practices are disregarded.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.070 align:middle line:90%
And they're not gone.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.870 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
believers, the Hopis,

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.560 align:middle line:90%
in extraterrestrial life?

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Very much.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: UFOs, do
things like that happen?

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Do you see things out there?

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:03.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:84%
There's these plasma
balls, these light balls--

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Orbs?

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, that
have been seen.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I get videos sent to me all
the time from friends of mine

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.430 align:middle line:84%
out there, and they
flicker, and then they move

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and really erratic
kind of movement,

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.230 align:middle line:90%
and there's groupings of them.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.210 align:middle line:90%
There's big ones, small ones.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:24.170 align:middle line:90%
They're incredible.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's so magical
about the reservations?

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: They're
happening more and more.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, because I
believe that in Hopi prophecy,

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.830 align:middle line:84%
as they say, there will
be a fair-haired man,

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:43.410 align:middle line:84%
white man coming from the
East carrying a tablet that is

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:44.685 align:middle line:90%
a part of their prophecy--

00:31:44.685 --> 00:31:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like Moses.

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Right.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people have
interpreted that prophecy

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.490 align:middle line:84%
as being a white guy coming
from the East with a tablet,

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:54.600 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It sounds like it.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It's not.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:57.660 align:middle line:90%
It's the Pleiadians.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.180 align:middle line:84%
They are going to be
the ones to come back,

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and they are very much
a part of Hopi culture.

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
they so important?

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Because
they helped develop

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.020 align:middle line:84%
all these different
societies around the world.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:14.520 align:middle line:84%
They helped develop
Tiwanaku, Stonehenge.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.110 align:middle line:84%
They've been a part
of Hopi culture.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.352 align:middle line:84%
They've been a part of so
many different cultures.

00:32:18.352 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they're friendly?

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: The Pleiadians
are demigods.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.215 align:middle line:84%
They have come to help
humans over and over again.

00:32:26.215 --> 00:32:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do they
look like, Sonja?

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.757 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: They're tall.

00:32:28.757 --> 00:32:31.470 align:middle line:90%
They're like 14 feet high.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Blond, white hair, blue,
blue eyes, very fair skin.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big are their
craft if they're 14 feet high?

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I don't think
all aliens travel

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:90%
in the way of craft.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I think many times, they're
able to use gateways.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:52.680 align:middle line:84%
In Tiwanaku, there is
a gateway to the sun.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiadians showed me how
they came and travelled through

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.930 align:middle line:90%
that gateway to the people.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So that wasn't by craft,
that was through a wormhole,

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.715 align:middle line:90%
some kind of energy--

00:33:06.715 --> 00:33:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like
dimensional shifts.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Sure, sure.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or something like that.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Sure.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you learned
much from the Pleiadians?

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I have.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:84%
They've really told me on
all of my spirit travels

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:84%
that I've run into them and had
a chance to talk with them how

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.660 align:middle line:84%
they developed a place, why they
developed it, the ceremonies

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.160 align:middle line:90%
that they taught the people.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.670 align:middle line:84%
There's so much that they
have given to the human race.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.890 align:middle line:90%
And they want no credit.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:40.320 align:middle line:84%
They're not here to somehow
brag about what they've done.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.480 align:middle line:90%
They help us and then they go.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What
extraterrestrial species--

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.860 align:middle line:84%
maybe it is the
Pleiadians-- that still

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:90%
play an important role for us?

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.280 align:middle line:90%
Is it just them?

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It's the Pleiadians.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
extraterrestrials

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.180 align:middle line:90%
that are wanting to take over.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.755 align:middle line:84%
The Reptilians are always
trying to take over.

00:34:01.755 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
The Greys, they've
come in many times

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and tried various
ways to step in.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:84%
There's new aliens, new
groups coming in all the time,

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to influence
humans to do their agenda.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting now on
Gaia's "Initiation" show,

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:24.816 align:middle line:84%
Matias de Stefano talks about
humanity's guiding forces.

00:34:24.816 --> 00:34:27.600 align:middle line:10%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: So the
purpose of Pleiadian people

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:32.340 align:middle line:10%
is like being those high masters
and guides in the matter that

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:37.920 align:middle line:10%
tells us why we are here and
what we can do to improve

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.300 align:middle line:10%
ourselves, what we can
do to enlight ourselves

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.840 align:middle line:10%
to understand reality.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.739 align:middle line:84%
How we can transform matter
and time in every reality

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:50.949 align:middle line:90%
that we have created.

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:55.830 align:middle line:10%
So they are the guides of the
spiritual world in the material

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.730 align:middle line:10%
world.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Arcturian
people are the ones

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.150 align:middle line:84%
taking care of the
matter of the structures.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:09.090 align:middle line:84%
They are like the doctors and
the scientists of the galaxy.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:12.030 align:middle line:10%
They were the ones
trying to bring

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:18.030 align:middle line:10%
all these enlightened concepts
of spiral and understanding

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:22.200 align:middle line:10%
the importance of these
spiritual patterns

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.600 align:middle line:10%
to the physical ones and
put them all together.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:30.150 align:middle line:10%
So they discover how
spirituality moves through DNA,

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.180 align:middle line:10%
through evolution,
and they evolve

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:38.730 align:middle line:10%
in their own planets trying
to take much power as possible

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:44.540 align:middle line:10%
from the spiritual world
through the physical bodies.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:49.100 align:middle line:10%
So both of them are
kind of the same

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.860 align:middle line:10%
looking in different
perspectives.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:56.270 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians has the goal
to bring Heaven on Earth,

00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and the Arctruians has the goal
to bring that Earth to Heaven.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:10%
But it's not a goal that they
want to leave the material

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:13.190 align:middle line:10%
world, but they want to create
a physical world that is exactly

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.980 align:middle line:10%
the same as the ethereal one.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So improving this reality,
improving the matter in order

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:24.680 align:middle line:84%
to create civilizations
and create beings

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:29.270 align:middle line:84%
aligned with the light that
is within the structures

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:84%
of the three
dimensional realities.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, he
echoes, Sonja, many

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:84%
of the things you've said
on this program today.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And that the
influence that humans

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:84%
have had throughout
time, whether it's

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:48.510 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiadians or other
demigods, is immense.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:49.310 align:middle line:90%
It's immense.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And if we look to the past
and we look at the gods

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that the people worshiped,
just in one culture,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.300 align:middle line:84%
there's little figurines,
deities, all these things.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It reveals to us the
massive amount of influence

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.870 align:middle line:90%
that people have had.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could wave
a magic wand over this world

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.670 align:middle line:84%
we're in now, what
would you try to fix?

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: I would want
to instill in people

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that even though we're
here in this Fourth World

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and we're watching the end of
this phase of humanity happen,

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I would want to instill in
people the very image that's

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.760 align:middle line:84%
on those rocks, those
ancient sites that I visited,

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.500 align:middle line:90%
which is the spiral.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.230 align:middle line:90%
The spiral is about eternity.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:44.640 align:middle line:84%
It's our journey as we
walk that spiral to God.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important
that we have hope.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.450 align:middle line:84%
If we lose our hope
because we're feeling like,

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:54.570 align:middle line:84%
oh, my representatives
aren't doing their job

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:58.290 align:middle line:84%
or the gas prices
are too high or some

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:00.630 align:middle line:84%
hopelessness that
people can get,

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.610 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to
have a hard time.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:05.220 align:middle line:84%
We must keep our
energy up, and we

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.570 align:middle line:84%
must keep our energy filled
with hope because that's

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.210 align:middle line:84%
what keeps our species
going, and that's

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:16.800 align:middle line:84%
what keeps us connected
as we walk that spiral.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So as you look
down the tunnel of light,

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is it hopeful for
us for the future?

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes, it's very hopeful.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:27.900 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have some trials.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have some
times that will be tough,

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and it will bring us
all closer together,

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.317 align:middle line:84%
which is what's happened
over history, right?

00:38:36.317 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.692 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: We've seen
it over and over.

00:38:38.692 --> 00:38:40.770 align:middle line:84%
If we could just
look to the past,

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:84%
we will learn about how to
manage and help ourselves

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.170 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're
into technology too.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't you have a new app out?

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I do.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.508 align:middle line:84%
My app is called
Spirit Traveler.

00:38:52.508 --> 00:38:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does it do?

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: It's taking
people into the Pyramid.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And inside the pyramid,
they're discovered--

00:38:59.170 --> 00:38:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Literally.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Literally.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.190 align:middle line:90%
It's totally 3D.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.470 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: They're discovering
the physical, mental, emotional,

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual bodies, and
they can access and learn

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.990 align:middle line:10%
about what is their liver,
what is their pancreas, what

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:16.830 align:middle line:10%
is the soul body, what is
the amygdala in the brain?

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:19.870 align:middle line:84%
There's meditations,
there's all kinds of things.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:20.710 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
next for you, Sonja?

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Well, I'll
be out there working

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.945 align:middle line:84%
day in and day out with all
my clients and helping people.

00:39:27.945 --> 00:39:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You love humanity.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I do.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.253 align:middle line:90%
I do, and I love you, George.

00:39:31.253 --> 00:39:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sonja, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Thank you so much.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.300 align:middle line:84%
I really love being
here with you.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You've touched a
lot of lives over the years,

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:40.830 align:middle line:10%
and she'll continue
to touch lives

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.560 align:middle line:10%
because she is a mystic healer.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.610 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.790 align:middle line:90%
