00:00:17.758 --> 00:00:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Linda Backman back with
us, a psychologist and hypnotic

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.160 align:middle line:10%
regression therapist,
who has literally

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:10%
guided thousands of
clients to understand

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.220 align:middle line:10%
their souls, past lives,
and time between lives.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Linda, welcome back
to the program.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA BACKMAN:
Thank you, George.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be back.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Well, thank you.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:90%
That's good to be well.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in doing what you do?

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: I had an
experience about 30 years ago.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:10%
I was not into this
work before that.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:10%
I had an experience through
the death of a colleague.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:10%
I had a colleague die.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:10%
And a very long
story made short,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.415 align:middle line:10%
I could sense him talking
to me from the other side.

00:00:57.415 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was strange.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was real.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
It felt real, but I'd never
experienced that before.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
He also started showing
me scenes of past lives.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, either
I need my own psychologist,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
or there's something
real about this.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, I discovered
in talking to my husband

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
that my husband had always
believed in past lives.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:90%
We had never talked about that.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So I just hopped on the
journey of what can I

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:90%
read, what can I learn.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And 30 years later, I've
been guiding regression

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.168 align:middle line:90%
for about 27, 28 years.

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has there
been anything that

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.340 align:middle line:90%
has shocked you along the way?

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes I mean, I think
that some things that are not

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:84%
new to me now but
were new to me then,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
which I'm assuming we'll
talk about, today, souls that

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:84%
don't necessarily incarnate
on Earth, souls that

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:90%
come from the angelic realm.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, that
was maybe not shocking,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.090 align:middle line:90%
but new information.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Surprising.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now you mix your
psychological and spiritual

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:90%
So what is psycho spiritual?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.747 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Psycho spiritual
basically means--

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, obviously,
means who are we

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:84%
as a soul, why are we here, why
did we come into body, where

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:90%
do we come from.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
The psychological
piece is, how do we

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
understand why our
life is the way it is

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and cope with it more
effectively based

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:90%
on who we are as a soul.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fantastic.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Now how do you access the
information that you go out

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:90%
and get?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
technically I use hypnosis.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
You used that when you
introduce me, a lot of people

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:90%
misunderstand hypnosis.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
They think hypnosis
means you can

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:90%
made to do embarrassing things.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
You can lose
control of yourself.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:90%
Hypnosis is purely relaxation.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
So I guide the client simply
into a more relaxed state.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:84%
They become more
intuitively open.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:84%
We through brain research
that when we relax--

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle line:84%
we know through EEG
and brain scan research

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that when we relax, our right
hemisphere of our brain, which

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
is where our intuitive
capabilities are held,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
the right hemisphere
of our brain

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:84%
becomes more lit
up on a brain scan.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:90%
So we simply are more open.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had heard that there
are different types of souls.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Originally, I only thought
there was one soul.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:90%
We have what we have.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But there are more than
one different types.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Correct.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a soul is
a soul is a soul.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But there are souls that are
designed to, you might say,

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.210 align:middle line:84%
incarnate and
evolve differently.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So there are three
types of souls.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I've learned this through
client after client.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Trial and error?

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Not so
much trial and error,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:84%
but the information that
automatically comes forward

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:90%
in a regression.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.100 align:middle line:84%
When I'm not giving the
information to the client,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:90%
they're giving it to me.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So, some of us are
Earth-based souls.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:84%
People mistake, sometimes, and
think I'm saying Earth-bound.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that number
one, Earth-based?

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: That probably
what's most common, yeah,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
in that sense of
being number one.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So an Earth-based
soul is a soul that

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
was designed to incarnate
and evolve in body on Earth,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:84%
usually, hundreds, if not
a thousand or more lives

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, growing and
evolving, tripping

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.793 align:middle line:90%
and falling in human life.

00:04:34.793 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:90%
That's an Earth-based.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's one.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.557 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's one.

00:04:37.557 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the second?

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Second one is
an interplanetary soul.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:90%
People can exchange that term.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Starseed means the same.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:90%
ET means the same.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%
That's a soul that evolves
somewhere other than Earth,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:84%
evolves in an advanced culture
somewhere in the universe, star

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:90%
system, planet.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's a soul
that comes to Earth

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
to aid humanity because they
come from an evolved culture.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So the term I was given
through regression

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:90%
is interplanetary soul.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
The only reason those souls
come into body on Earth

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:84%
is because they come from
an evolved perspective.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.323 align:middle line:90%
They come to help us here.

00:05:17.323 --> 00:05:18.615 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, that's number two.

00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's number two.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Number three-- there
are only three.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Number three is an angelic soul.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
An angelic soul comes
from the angelic realm.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:84%
That realm of soul
supports the divine.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Call it the source.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Call it great spirit.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:90%
People can use their term.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
The angelic, I'd like to
call it a cadre of souls.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Angelic souls carry the
energy of the high frequency

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:90%
we think of as source.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:84%
That's basically a love
and compassion energy.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So their signature energy,
their reason for coming to Earth

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.420 align:middle line:84%
is to aid a more acceptance,
a greater peace, love,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.615 align:middle line:90%
compassion, perspective.

00:06:00.615 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now these different
types of souls, Linda,

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
that you have,
these one of three,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:90%
when do we know what we have?

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.260 align:middle line:90%
When we die?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Or can we find out
when we're still alive?

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Oh, yeah, again,
a great question, George.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of my clients, before they
come for regression already

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:90%
either know or have a sense of--

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, I don't
come from here.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, Linda,
when I was a child,

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated with
staring out at the night sky.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated with the
movement of the planets.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I knew I came from
somewhere out there.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:90%
I hear that sometimes.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Other clients come
for regression,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and they learn through the
regression their, what I call,

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:90%
soul origin.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:90%
They learn that.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what is
important of the three?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Is there one more
important than the other?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Absolutely not.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:90%
They are equally important.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Their role on Earth can
be somewhat different,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:84%
but they're not better
than each other.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
They're not more
evolved than each other.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
The value of understanding
am I Earth-based,

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
am I interplanetary,
am I angelic

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:90%
is to understand our self.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:90%
So why do I feel so different?

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.592 align:middle line:84%
Why do I have these
unique qualities?

00:07:21.592 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have
a client of yours

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.530 align:middle line:84%
who has talked about how her
life has been transformed.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The process of regression
with Linda has been absolutely

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.640 align:middle line:84%
transformational for me
and very eye opening.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Going back through
time and experiencing

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:84%
how certain events in the past,
which were very challenging,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
had a lesson hidden and how
that lesson shows up today

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:90%
in my life has been priceless.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:84%
The ability to
understand and identify

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
patterns of thinking, patterns
of behavior that trace back

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:84%
through lifetimes, and that
still show up in my life today,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:84%
holding me back, is
powerful information

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
that I can use right now to
be more effective as a leader,

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
as a professional, as
a mother, as a friend.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And the most important part
for me, my favorite part,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:84%
has been to trace and experience
where my soul is coming from.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
It gave me clarity on and answer
really the questions that I had

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:90%
on why am I feeling this way?

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Why am I feeling inadequate
or that I don't belong truly

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:90%
where I am.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It gave me the
information that I needed.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:90%
It gave me a sense of relief.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:90%
It gave me a sense of peace.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:90%
I experienced joy.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:84%
It really ignited
a new energy in me.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And Linda, through her process,
she's absolutely professional,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:84%
caring, and I felt
at every single step

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:90%
that I was being taken care of.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:90%
And that I was in good hands.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you got
high grades on that.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: This is a lovely
woman, fascinating woman.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You changed her life.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, and
it and it gave her

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
a sense of understanding
herself, as well as accepting

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.560 align:middle line:90%
the drive that she has.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.110 align:middle line:84%
She's a woman that
supports Latinas,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and she has spent years
working in the corporate world,

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
but she's doing, writing
about helping Latinas

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:84%
embrace their skills, their
capabilities, and why they're

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But she now understands herself
more effectively, which I love.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did she come
to you in the first place?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: She had
learned about my work.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:90%
People come to me.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I think the most common question
that people that they carry

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and that they bring when
they come for a regression

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:90%
is, why am I here?

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.510 align:middle line:90%
What are my intentions?

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Why is my life sometimes
been challenging?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Why did I have
difficult parents?

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
confused, aren't they?

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Totally.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In many cases.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you try to put
them back in perspective.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:84%
I think what I love,
George, once upon a time,

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
years ago, I was a
conventional psychologist.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:90%
I liked doing that work.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I felt a different
kind of responsibility.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I felt a little bit more
weight on my shoulders

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.230 align:middle line:90%
in general psychology.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:84%
My job, in many ways,
is a facilitator.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I facilitate the regression,
and the information

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:90%
comes through the client.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't give them
the information.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.685 align:middle line:84%
I simply support them to
access the information.

00:10:26.685 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda, are you
surprised, sometimes,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
at what you hear
from the client?

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: I would say yes.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:84%
At this stage of
my working life--

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.383 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've heard it all?

00:10:37.383 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: It would take
a lot to surprise me.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But I have clients on
spaceships, spacecraft.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
They can describe
the craft in detail.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:84%
They can describe the
role of various souls

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:84%
on the craft and the purpose
of functioning on a spacecraft.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Today, I find that fascinating.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.467 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I would have thought
that was extremely strange.

00:10:59.467 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Did they ever talk about moments
in hell or anything like that?

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Honestly, in,
again, about 27 years

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:84%
of guiding regression, I have
never had a client describe

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.430 align:middle line:90%
a place that would be hell.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I think if there is
hellacious experience,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:90%
it's here in body on Earth.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now after
sessions with your clients,

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.070 align:middle line:90%
how did they feel?

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Initially, they
feel a little bit, I might say,

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:90%
like a deer in the headlights.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Initially, when we
close the regression

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and then I take time to
process the session with them,

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot to absorb.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:44.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to sift
through and pick through.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:84%
But they discover
things like, oh, here's

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
why I have these feelings
about this friend.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:84%
This friend was my
spouse, and my spouse

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:90%
died early in our marriage.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
wondered why I was

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.100 align:middle line:90%
afraid of losing this friend.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:90%
That's just one example.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So they receive, usually,
so much information,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
both past life and
soul level information

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that it takes a while
to pick through it,

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.288 align:middle line:84%
and I assist them to absorb
it and find understanding.

00:12:18.288 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The first type of
soul that you just mentioned

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:90%
was the Earth-based soul.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.735 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what is that?

00:12:24.735 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So an
Earth-based soul

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:90%
is designed to come to Earth.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:84%
An Earth-based
soul begins almost

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:84%
like a kindergartner,
if you will,

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:84%
a kindergarten level soul
just learning the basics,

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:84%
just like what a child
learns in school.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.073 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: From
ground zero, right?

00:12:42.073 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: From ground zero.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:84%
There are also--
I'll add, people

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:90%
might find this interesting.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
There is a soul nursery
in the higher realm.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:84%
There is a prep
place, if you will,

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.390 align:middle line:84%
where Earth-based souls are
prepared to come to Earth

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:90%
before they come to Earth.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they generally
have different human traits

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and personalities?

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Souls
have a signature,

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:90%
I call it, a soul archetype.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.478 align:middle line:90%
There are seven.

00:13:09.478 --> 00:13:11.020 align:middle line:84%
I've learned this
through regression.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:90%
There are seven soul archetypes.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And so, we come--

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:84%
when our soul is new, we
carry a signature orientation

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
to life, one of
seven archetypes.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is the goal then
to stay an Earth-based soul

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
or to move on into
something else?

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: If we're
an Earth-based soul,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:84%
we're always an
Earth-based soul.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.412 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is what it is.

00:13:37.412 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It Is what it is.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:84%
There are some of the
earliest Earth-based souls

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:90%
that continue to incarnate.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:84%
One I've learned a
fair amount about

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
is one we might
call the Moses soul.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not teaching
religion when I say this.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
The Moses soul is the soul
that was the soul of Moses.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:84%
That soul has been
coming to Earth long

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.380 align:middle line:90%
before the time of Moses.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
That soul continues
to incarnate on Earth

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.665 align:middle line:90%
to affect change in humanity.

00:14:10.665 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you
have many people

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:90%
with the same kind of soul?

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:84%
You can have-- a soul can
incarnate in more than one body

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:26.470 align:middle line:84%
That's only an advanced
soul, and that's only--

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fair
to say that's almost

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.660 align:middle line:90%
only an Earth-based soul.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you
die, does the soul

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:90%
separate from the body?

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.398 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
where does it go?

00:14:38.398 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So when we're born
we have a fractal, a portion,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:84%
a slice of the pie, if
you will, of our soul.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:84%
We bring a percentage
of our soul energy

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.780 align:middle line:90%
into our body at birth.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what causes us
to live and breathe.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
The remainder is
our higher self.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
The remainder is our soul in the
higher realm called the higher

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
When we die, that
slice of our soul

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:90%
automatically exits the body.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It's on autopilot,
you might say.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Many of us who've been
around a loved one,

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:84%
who's passing or has passed,
will feel that shift.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
That slice of soul returns
to the higher self.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:84%
That's tied to the
regression that I do.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.570 align:middle line:84%
We follow that journey
at the end of a past life

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:90%
in the regression.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who decides what the
soul does, how it reincarnates,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:90%
how it incarnates?

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: We always
have spiritual guides.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:42.018 align:middle line:84%
We are never without a guiding
force from the higher realms.

00:15:42.018 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
these guides, Linda.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So an Earth-based
soul, an interplanetary soul,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:53.170 align:middle line:84%
an angelic soul always has
a lead or a senior guide.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.262 align:middle line:84%
That guide is a soul
in the higher realm.

00:15:56.262 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's just
like a guardian angel?

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, perfect term.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Perfect term.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.370 align:middle line:90%
They assist us.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, we sense them.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I have some clients
who will say,

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, I've been
talking to Bernadette,

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:90%
my guide, since I was 12.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Others of us-- other clients
will say, I sense a guide,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:90%
but I don't have a--

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a human image.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a name.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:90%
I just sense guidance.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Either is perfectly legitimate.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of
my favorite poems

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
is Footprints in the
Sand, and it basically

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:84%
is about an individual
who thinks that God

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.070 align:middle line:90%
has forsaken him, has left him.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about how
he walks in the sand,

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:84%
but only sees one
set of footprints.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:90%
And he thinks they're his.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:90%
God, where are you?

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:90%
You've left me.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, God comes and
talks to him and says--

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:90%
and I'm paraphrasing the poem--

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:90%
those are my footprints.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.170 align:middle line:90%
I carried you.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen in real life?

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: You
bring up some really

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.910 align:middle line:84%
important and interesting
topics, like what is God?

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Are we guided by God and
those sorts of things.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:90%
I do have clients.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:84%
At times, they're
usually angelic souls

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
who feel direct communication
from the divine,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.680 align:middle line:90%
and they use their own term.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:84%
I have one client I've
regressed more than once.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:90%
She's an angelic soul.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:84%
She refers to speaking with
the great divine director.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The man in charge.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, exactly.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.797 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
they're not hallucinating?

00:17:39.797 --> 00:17:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Great question.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:84%
When I trained
people in regression,

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I train people to what I like
to call corroborating evidence.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So when we've guided this type
of regression over and over,

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:84%
we learn about colors
in the higher realm

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and what those colors mean, what
the frequency of those colors

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:90%
mean.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:84%
We learn about what are
the indications when

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:84%
a client crosses over
from a past life,

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:84%
from the ending of a past
life in the regression.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
What are the indications
they're an interplanetary soul?

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So the regression therapist
has to be educated, almost

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:84%
like a semi-encyclopedia
in your brain about soul,

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:84%
so that as the therapist, I look
for pieces that fit together.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't share those with the
client during the regression.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You do not.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Because I
want their regression

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:90%
to be spontaneous and clean.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: OK, without
any influence.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do people who
have done bad things still

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
have these spirit
guides that help them?

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Oh, yes.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I would say, no matter
what we've done--

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.090 align:middle line:84%
someone, there was
infidelity, let's

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:84%
just say, in a past
life or a current life.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Our guide never leaves us.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Our guide is benevolent,
not judgmental.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not their job
to be judgmental.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.580 align:middle line:84%
It's their job to be
supportive and guide us

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:90%
toward more effective behavior.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if somebody like
Ted Bundy, a serial killer,

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
who would help that
person spiritually?

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that brings up
the notion of free will.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So a Ted Bundy, a
Hitler, a Saddam Hussein,

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:29.620 align:middle line:84%
that is human free will
choice to behave in those

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:90%
nefarious ways.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And our guides are not happy
with that kind of behavior.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they
failed, the guides?

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: The
guides haven't failed

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
because the guides do what
they can to, if you will,

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.405 align:middle line:84%
guide or direct that soul
to behave differently.

00:19:45.405 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But obviously, with
a Ted Bundy or somebody else,

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.317 align:middle line:84%
they're not doing what
they're supposed to do.

00:19:51.317 --> 00:19:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's correct.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is the unique
quality of Earth incarnation

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:84%
is that we have a
plan, but I like

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.980 align:middle line:84%
to say we can go off script
because we can use free will.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:84%
When we cross over
from that lifetime,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
we are met with a panel
of senior teachers.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And they ask us to own up
to what we did or didn't do.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:84%
If we own up to it, we're dealt
with somewhat differently.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.430 align:middle line:84%
If we try to pull the wool
over the eyes of that team

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:26.600 align:middle line:84%
of advanced souls, call them
ascended masters, if you want,

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
they are not happy
with that at all.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda,
how many past lives

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:90%
do most Earth-bound souls have?

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Probably,
George, hundreds, if not

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:90%
more than a thousand.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.238 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That many?

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And it
depends on where we

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:90%
are in our evolutionary path.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.750 align:middle line:84%
If you think about a
10-point scale of evolution,

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:84%
if we're a three or
a four, we probably

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:90%
have maybe 200 lives, 300 lives.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.940 align:middle line:84%
If we're an advanced
soul coming into body,

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're, let's just say, a
7 or an 8 on a scale of 10,

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
we probably have
hundreds of lives.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they similar lives?

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Do they all die the same?

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Do they do different things
or same things in life?

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes and no.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:10%
The yes and no is because
of this archetypal energy

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:10%
that we carry as a soul,
we have an orientation.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:84%
In certain ways, we might
be a teacher of types.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.990 align:middle line:84%
We might be someone
more behind the scenes,

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:84%
supportive of others, that
our soul nature shows up

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, no,
we don't die the same.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
clients and discovering

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.950 align:middle line:84%
many of their lives,
and they certainly

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:90%
don't all die from a disease.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.020 align:middle line:84%
They don't always
die from old age.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.333 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
ways that we can pass.

00:21:54.333 --> 00:21:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The second type
of soul you mentioned

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:90%
was the interplanetary soul.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.520 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So the
woman you heard

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:84%
speak, the client of mine,
she's an interplanetary soul.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I just call it an IP
soul to make it easy.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Interplanetary souls aren't
used to being in body on Earth,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.910 align:middle line:84%
so they're not used
to these human bodies

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and how these physical
bodies function.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
They're also not used
to human ways of life.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they into
the ET souls and bodies?

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, they could
be called ET souls.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:90%
The same term would fit.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:84%
When I regressed them,
and they learn they're

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:39.970 align:middle line:90%
an IP or an ET soul, we learn--

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about one
from just the other day.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.460 align:middle line:84%
They often go to
their home location

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
in the higher realm that is
always an advanced location,

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:84%
but they may have an
unusual type of body.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:84%
They may have an
insect-like body.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Praying mantis
type, that kind of thing?

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly I
believe mantis beings are

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.960 align:middle line:84%
very, very real and
not dangerous to us

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:84%
because I've had many clients
describe their IP home location

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:90%
form as like a mantis.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What determines
if you're an earthbound

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.410 align:middle line:90%
soul or an interplanetary soul?

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: People ask me
that, and my understanding--

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes, I have
to say to clients, well,

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.190 align:middle line:84%
that might be
above my pay grade.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Nothing's
above your pay grade.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So my
sense, George, is

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.610 align:middle line:84%
that there's a higher
realm process that

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:47.090 align:middle line:84%
decides on creating
new Earth-based souls,

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:52.460 align:middle line:84%
new interplanetary
souls, new angelic souls.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.410 align:middle line:84%
An important understanding about
IP souls, interplanetary souls,

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:84%
is that they may struggle
with health issues.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Because they've not
been in these bodies,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.950 align:middle line:84%
they may struggle
with digestive issues.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there similarities
with interplanetary souls?

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
If you had 10 of
them in human bodies,

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
would they all have
traits the same?

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: If I had 10 IP souls
in a room, probably, 7 to 8

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.920 align:middle line:84%
of those 10 have some
health issue they struggle.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:90%
That's remarkable.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Serious, not serious?

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Serious,
not serious, but more--

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:84%
they usually have
some advanced skill,

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:84%
whether it's an artistic skill,
a music skill, a type of work,

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
a left brain skill, a numbers
skill, and a technology skill.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:84%
They always are
advanced in some way.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.470 align:middle line:84%
I say to them when they
discover in a regression,

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:84%
if that's the way they discover
their IP, I say to them,

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:84%
there's only one
reason you're in body.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It's because you come from a
place of advanced way of life,

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and you're bringing those
skills to Earth to aid Earth.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:18.350 align:middle line:84%
But at times, they struggle
with all kinds of issues,

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:84%
from health issues
to emotional issues.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.750 align:middle line:84%
They need to know
who they are so

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that they know why they're
here, so that they can immerse

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:90%
themselves in accepting that.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who puts them here?

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Advanced souls,
advanced interplanetary souls

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.430 align:middle line:90%
who--

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:84%
actually, let me add a piece
because I think it's important.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Through regression, I have
never come across a client that

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:90%
came into body and was coerced.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So when we say puts
them here, who helps

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:84%
them decide whether
to come and why?

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Those are guides.

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Do they come because
they've been forced?

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:01.343 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:01.343 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:90%
I've never found that.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.093 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not at all.

00:26:03.093 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Linda had a client during
a regression, who dies

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.180 align:middle line:84%
in a past life and travels back
to where his soul came from.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:90%
It's truly amazing.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.960 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Your soul has
stepped out of your body

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:10%
as it naturally does.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:10%
Remember you've experienced
this many, many times.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:10%
You're moving into a place
of expanded awareness, as you

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:30.670 align:middle line:10%
become aware that you are
looking at your body as opposed

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:10%
to being in your body.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:10%
Does that feel correct?

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes it looks very
much like before.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Very good.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:10%
So you're now in touch
with your soul level.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm blue.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:90%
It feels like a stretchy light.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:53.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm moving from a dark
night with all the stars

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:10%
toward a round opening of light

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: OK, good.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.590 align:middle line:10%
>> It has ripples in it
in the sides of the walls,

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:10%
like a stretchy tube.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.760 align:middle line:10%
It's dark with lots of stars.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:16.570 align:middle line:10%
It feels like I've
gone through something,

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.720 align:middle line:10%
and then I'm just there.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: You're just where?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:10%
>> In this very vast place.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm just floating there.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.330 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: How do
you feel where you

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.480 align:middle line:10%
are in this vast place,
where you're floating.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.800 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel safe.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm just not sure what
I'm supposed to do.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: OK.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:10%
Take your time.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:10%
You'll be shown or guided.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> There's another
body coming toward me.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a very warm energy.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.860 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: So see what
this energy wants to do.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.410 align:middle line:10%
>> It wants me to follow it.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:56.210 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: OK.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:10%


00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:10%
>> We seem to be going
toward like a Milky Way.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.420 align:middle line:10%
Beautiful.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a large
round table of light,

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:84%
with other lights
swirling in it.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:10%
They're my friends,
to welcome me back.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:22.575 align:middle line:10%
I'm asking them what else?

00:28:22.575 --> 00:28:23.375 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:10%


00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:29.330 align:middle line:10%
>> You're always provided
for, one of them said.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:10%
Remember who you are.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you got
that information from him,

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.300 align:middle line:90%
was he hypnotically regressed?

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, this is
part of his regression.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when he
comes out of the hypnosis,

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:84%
does he remember
what he said, or does

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.350 align:middle line:90%
he have to watch this video?

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: For the
most part, yes,

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.810 align:middle line:84%
the client remembers
what they've said.

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I record all sessions, and the
client receives the recording.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:84%
They may forget
little small details,

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.610 align:middle line:84%
but the client is basically
aware of what's happening

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:90%
and what they're saying.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he think he was
an extraterrestrial soul?

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:05.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Well, this client--

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and I love that we're using
this particular client.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:90%
This client is an angelic soul.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:84%
In the regression,
this client learns

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:15.950 align:middle line:90%
he is from the angelic realm.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:90%
So he's not--

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He did not
know that before that.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: He did not.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it important
for us to know what type of soul

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.040 align:middle line:90%
you are?

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Because it helps
us understand our nature.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It helps us understand our
attitudes, our feelings.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:36.010 align:middle line:84%
An angelic soul,
in particular, may

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:84%
struggle with human stress,
human opposition, one human

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.800 align:middle line:84%
not treating the other in
the most benevolent way.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:51.010 align:middle line:84%
That's a particular
struggle for an angelic soul

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:84%
because they come
from a realm that is

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.910 align:middle line:90%
pure love and pure compassion.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So when they know
that, they can ease off

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
being so upset by human behavior
that always isn't so kind.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda, what brings
an interplanetary soul down

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.340 align:middle line:90%
to good old planet Earth?

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Because
that interplanetary

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:14.590 align:middle line:84%
soul has agreed to
come to Earth to help

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:19.510 align:middle line:84%
aid Earth in understanding
humanity and advancing

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.498 align:middle line:90%
humanity.

00:30:20.498 --> 00:30:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that their mission?

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.530 align:middle line:84%
The woman that we listened
to, the interplanetary soul

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:84%
that we've listened
to, she's come

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.520 align:middle line:84%
to support women
of a culture where

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:84%
the culture hasn't taught
those women to let their skills

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.280 align:middle line:90%
shine.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.855 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of her
mission in this current life.

00:30:42.855 --> 00:30:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So as
human beings, they

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:48.283 align:middle line:84%
must be pretty enlightened
at the same time.

00:30:48.283 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It's interesting.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they're enlightened.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes,
an interplanetary

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.430 align:middle line:84%
soul because they know
they're different,

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:57.050 align:middle line:90%
they may not understand it.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.580 align:middle line:90%
But they know they're different.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, sometimes, they struggle
with living their mission.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:07.870 align:middle line:84%
They struggle with coming
forward with their wisdom

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:11.330 align:middle line:84%
because they just haven't
been on Earth many times.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the
three souls, we've

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.170 align:middle line:84%
talked about-- we'll get into
angelic in a second here.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Which one would
you prefer to be?

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
I know what I am.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.477 align:middle line:84%
But so, you're saying,
probably, if I had a choice--

00:31:23.477 --> 00:31:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you're angelic.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:25.732 align:middle line:90%
That's my guess.

00:31:25.732 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Actually, I'm not.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're not?

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I'm an
Earth-based soul.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You are?

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: I am.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:31.540 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you glad you are?

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think
the answer is yes.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm an Earth-based soul.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot about
my own past lives.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I know I've been coming to
Earth for a very long time,

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:84%
so it makes it somewhat easier
for me to function on Earth.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think that people who
are spiritually oriented,

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:59.580 align:middle line:84%
at times, struggle with
life, struggle with humanity.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Because, often, spiritual
people desire for humanity

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to operate more effectively,
from a place of higher

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.710 align:middle line:90%
integrity.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:84%
As an Earth-based soul,
I just have a fair amount

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.060 align:middle line:90%
of Earth experience.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So does that make it easy for
me to live every day of my life?

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Of course, not.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.990 align:middle line:90%
But easier.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.865 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, I'm an
Earth-based soul.

00:32:20.865 --> 00:32:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're
this Earth-based soul,

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:27.240 align:middle line:84%
whether you're Earth-based,
angelic, or interplanetary,

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:84%
how does it affect
you on this planet?

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So I'll speak
about interplanetary souls,

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll speak
about angelics.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Interplanetary souls
often struggle.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:84%
They just struggle with
the way of life of humans,

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's not to say that there
aren't humans of capability

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.480 align:middle line:90%
and integrity and kindness.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.470 align:middle line:90%
There certainly are.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We know there are.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: But
interplanetary souls, this

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.740 align:middle line:90%
is not their home location.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.980 align:middle line:90%
This is not familiar territory.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So they might have
health issues.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.890 align:middle line:84%
They might have
these, sometimes,

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:08.610 align:middle line:90%
complicating digestive issues.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:10.860 align:middle line:90%
And yet, we need them.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:90%
They need to be here.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.530 align:middle line:90%
We need their wisdom.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:90%
We need their perspective.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you meet someone,
can you tell what type of soul

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:84%
they are, just merely
by talking to them?

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Often, yes,
if I have enough time

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.290 align:middle line:84%
to learn about their
life history a bit,

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:33.850 align:middle line:84%
to learn about their
relationships, their health,

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:84%
their attitude about
their current life.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Often, yes, I can tell,
simply because I've

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:84%
listened to so many clients that
are all three types of souls.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:47.358 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can one of these souls
switch to another type of soul?

00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Good question.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.442 align:middle line:90%
People ask me that a lot.

00:33:49.442 --> 00:33:50.430 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can't.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.140 align:middle line:90%
You are what you are.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: You are
what you are, totally.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Until the end of time.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes,
except, maybe, I'll

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.370 align:middle line:84%
add-- this is
probably important.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:02.160 align:middle line:84%
You are what you are, yes,
until the end of time.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:84%
An Earth-based soul
that is experienced,

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.580 align:middle line:84%
usually, has a few
interplanetary past lives.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So part of the reason I
understand IPs, if you will,

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:84%
is because I have had
a small number of lives

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.010 align:middle line:90%
not on this planet.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:23.668 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, I've
come here over and over.

00:34:23.668 --> 00:34:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've been anchored
to good old planet Earth.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's right.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk
about angelic souls,

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.620 align:middle line:90%
what creates them.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, there
is a divine force

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:35.020 align:middle line:90%
that coordinates Earth.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.409 align:middle line:84%
My understanding of that divine
force, we can call it God.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.929 align:middle line:90%
We can call it the source.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah has a beautiful
word, Shekinah.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.889 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
about source that

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:54.310 align:middle line:84%
is a group soul of approximately
four highly advanced souls, who

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:middle line:90%
do what they can to guide Earth.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.990 align:middle line:90%
They can't come down here and--

00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Meddle.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: They don't
have that ability.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.550 align:middle line:90%
They can only guide.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
group of souls that

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.840 align:middle line:84%
make up the angelic
realm, who support--

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.290 align:middle line:84%
you might call them
ambassadors of source.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:17.020 align:middle line:90%
They carry source energy.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:84%
The angelic realm is
led by the archangels.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.540 align:middle line:84%
There are more than
four archangels.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
We think about the four
classic archangels--

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Michael, Gabriel,
Raphael, and Uriel.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.150 align:middle line:84%
There are more than
four, and then there

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.420 align:middle line:84%
are other angelic souls that
make up the angelic realm.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.700 align:middle line:84%
When they agree
to come to Earth,

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and they don't come
often, many of those souls

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.830 align:middle line:90%
don't ever come to Earth.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:44.230 align:middle line:84%
But they come to
Earth to bring--

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:84%
the easiest way to put it in the
words are a little bit hollow.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:50.615 align:middle line:84%
They bring a love and
compassion perspective.

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: That is who
they are as people.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
that wonderful movie,

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:56.050 align:middle line:84%
"It's a Wonderful Life"
with Jimmy Stewart?

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Angel Clarence
comes down to save his life.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Is there that kind of influence?

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.152 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:36:05.152 --> 00:36:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, that's
another great question.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:09.980 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is
that thousands of years

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:15.590 align:middle line:84%
ago, souls could-- even
angelic souls, materialize

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:84%
in an adult body and
then dematerialize.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I've been told many
times in regression,

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:23.310 align:middle line:90%
that no longer happens.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So if an angelic soul is
going to come into body,

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.050 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
born as an infant.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll also just add--

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.460 align:middle line:84%
people may find this
interesting-- at least two

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.160 align:middle line:84%
of the archangels,
Michael and Gabriel,

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:84%
incarnate even now
in human bodies.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:46.400 align:middle line:84%
That's come up a number of
times with regression clients.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So there
may be people walking

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:54.710 align:middle line:84%
around today who have the
incarnate soul of an archangel?

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That is correct.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And you know, I'm
pretty discerning, I think.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:04.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't just buy.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Someone comes for a
regression, and they

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:11.120 align:middle line:84%
say, well, I know I'm
archangel Gabriel or whatever.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I need for the regression to
contain a lot of information,

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.640 align:middle line:90%
to have a flow.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And again., I have my own
ways of fitting information

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.800 align:middle line:84%
together to see if one
piece of the regression

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.050 align:middle line:84%
supports another piece
of the regression.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But the answer,
honestly, is yes.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Michael and
archangel Gabriel do incarnate

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.610 align:middle line:90%
as everyday average people.

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:40.875 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:37:40.875 --> 00:37:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Can they incarnate in many
people at the same time?

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, because
they're so advanced.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, they can
manage more than one

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.120 align:middle line:90%
concurrent incarnation.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they want
our betterment, I assume?

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: That's the
only reason they come.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They come, again, to assist
humanity to progress.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had your choice
of being one of the three,

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.820 align:middle line:84%
what kind of soul
would you pick?

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think
if I had my choice,

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.410 align:middle line:90%
I'd probably be an angelic soul.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.710 align:middle line:84%
The angelic souls that I know,
and I know some quite well.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I've regressed them
more than once.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:23.220 align:middle line:84%
The man we heard, speaking
in the regression,

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.320 align:middle line:90%
is an angelic soul.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.690 align:middle line:84%
They have this
core of acceptance,

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:32.280 align:middle line:84%
this core of lack
of judgment that I

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:90%
don't find in many people.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:37.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a depth of caring
and non-judgment

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:90%
that is almost indescribable.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a love
for people, isn't it?

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.138 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unconditional?

00:38:43.138 --> 00:38:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, they're
beautiful individuals.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there many on
this planet, percentage-wise?

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: No, and my
understanding is there might be

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:55.240 align:middle line:90%
2% of the human population--

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it?

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: --who
are angelic souls.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not very common.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.202 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the highest percent?

00:39:01.202 --> 00:39:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Earth-based souls.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Earth-based.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:04.630 align:middle line:90%
They are what they are.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: They
are what they are.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You believe in
extraterrestrial life, Linda?

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.222 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Absolutely.

00:39:09.222 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they going through
the same thing we're going?

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Seeking, looking, trying
to find out who they are,

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:16.720 align:middle line:90%
where they came from?

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, I
think that there are so

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.210 align:middle line:84%
many locations in
the higher realm

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and the celestial
realm of ET souls

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.730 align:middle line:84%
or IP souls, however
we want to term,

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.720 align:middle line:90%
that each culture's different.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.200 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, I think they
are seeking to advance,

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.165 align:middle line:84%
seeking to grow, seeking
to aid the universe.

00:39:40.165 --> 00:39:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I learn about things
like what we might call

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.980 align:middle line:90%
a council in the higher realm.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So there is an interplanetary
council in the higher realm.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:57.430 align:middle line:84%
It's made up of souls from
various IP or ET locations,

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and it is almost like
a parliament of sorts,

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:06.680 align:middle line:84%
where these IP souls are
working together to aid Earth.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Teamwork.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Teamwork, absolutely.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the divine force?

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that the God force?

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does it do?

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It strives.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:23.680 align:middle line:84%
That force strives to help
humanity grow and advance.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:30.040 align:middle line:84%
They strive to help us deal
with inappropriate behavior.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:34.250 align:middle line:84%
We have political situations
right now all over the world,

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:38.800 align:middle line:84%
whether you think of
the Sudan or Ukraine.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.960 align:middle line:84%
It strives to aid what
I like to call nefarious

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:49.600 align:middle line:84%
behavior, free will, nefarious
behavior of certain humans.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.610 align:middle line:84%
It strives to help us alter
that, to move beyond that,

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:58.870 align:middle line:84%
to supersede that
or grow beyond that.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the
three types of souls,

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:84%
are they all equal in
terms of importance,

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:07.000 align:middle line:84%
or is one more important
than the other?

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely all equal.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.710 align:middle line:90%
All equally important.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:15.250 align:middle line:84%
All can be equally evolved,
depending on where they are

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:16.780 align:middle line:90%
in their evolutionary process.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.050 align:middle line:84%
But one is not better
than the other.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:24.070 align:middle line:84%
You've listened to a couple
of clients, where one is IP,

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.940 align:middle line:90%
and the other is angelic.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:84%
If you were to
meet these people,

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.450 align:middle line:90%
they're just average people.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But no, they're all
of equal importance.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.508 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you ever
had a client come to you

00:41:35.508 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:84%
that is totally troubled,
and then by the time

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:43.210 align:middle line:84%
your sessions are done,
they feel wonderful again?

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I guess
I would say, yes,

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I've had clients come who are
troubled with relationship

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.600 align:middle line:84%
issues, troubled with health
issues, monetary issues.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Once they have their
regression and we

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.490 align:middle line:84%
work with the content
of the regression--

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't
say that it's like

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.810 align:middle line:84%
You know instantaneously,
but explanations come forward

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:07.480 align:middle line:90%
about health issues.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Why did I have that mother
that behaved that way, that

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:12.640 align:middle line:90%
sibling that behaved that way?

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It gives them insight
that they often

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.410 align:middle line:90%
don't gain in another manner.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how can
an individual pinpoint

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:24.250 align:middle line:90%
the type of soul they may be?

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: To some
extent, that's my job.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.740 align:middle line:84%
That's my job to keep
asking questions.

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.020 align:middle line:84%
You can hear me asking
questions in these--

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.990 align:middle line:84%
particularly the
man the recording,

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:37.670 align:middle line:90%
I keep pushing for information.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I ask questions, I make
them as open-ended as possible.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't say, so are
you an angelic soul?

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I say, so where does
your soul come from?

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:54.670 align:middle line:90%
I look for defining features.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:58.300 align:middle line:84%
A fascinating piece about
regression with angelic souls

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:03.250 align:middle line:84%
is, often, when that soul
crosses over in the regression,

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:06.520 align:middle line:84%
moving beyond the death
scene of the past life,

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:11.650 align:middle line:84%
the soul describes their
soul energy with wings.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:15.890 align:middle line:84%
They have wings, which, in
the beginning, surprised me.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, I began
to realize, that's

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:24.320 align:middle line:84%
the higher realms signal to me
and to the client that client

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.860 align:middle line:90%
is usually an angelic soul.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
your next evolution?

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.370 align:middle line:90%
What's next for you?

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:35.550 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: I'm excited
about an upcoming trip.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:36.780 align:middle line:10%
I have a bucket list.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.760 align:middle line:10%
I haven't satisfied
that bucket list.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm co-leading, co-teaching,
taking a group to Egypt

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.310 align:middle line:84%
to study the ancient wisdom,
to study the ancient dynasties,

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and working with
an Egyptologist.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:53.280 align:middle line:90%
My father was born in Cairo.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.840 align:middle line:90%
God rest his soul.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Not Egyptian, but that's
where he popped, and he came.

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:00.122 align:middle line:90%
How do people find you?

00:44:00.122 --> 00:44:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: They can find
me through my website.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:02.880 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which is?

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:05.790 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: ravenheartcenter.com.

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:06.640 align:middle line:10%

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.440 align:middle line:90%

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda, thank you

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.260 align:middle line:90%

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Thank you.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind
of soul are you?

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Are you Earth-based?

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.930 align:middle line:10%
Are you interplanetary?

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:20.610 align:middle line:10%
Are you angelic?

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.270 align:middle line:10%
One day, you'll find out, and
it could change your life.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:26.520 align:middle line:84%
