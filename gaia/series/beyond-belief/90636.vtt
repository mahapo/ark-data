00:00:05.147 --> 00:00:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MICAH HANKS: We are
faced with a phenomena

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.240 align:middle line:84%
that neither history nor
science can fully explain.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Ever since the end of
the Second World War,

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.650 align:middle line:84%
reports of strange,
unidentified flying objects

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.200 align:middle line:90%
have occurred in our skies.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.270 align:middle line:90%
But what are they?

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And even more
strangely, many of them

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.130 align:middle line:84%
are described as resembling
rockets or missiles.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Are these secret wartime
technologies being tested,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.830 align:middle line:84%
or is there something
else going on?

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:84%
They were first referred to
during the 1940s as ghost

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:84%
rockets, and I believe they
may still be seen in our skies

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:90%
even today.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
You won't believe
this one, so stay

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.714 align:middle line:84%
tuned as "Beyond Belief" with
George Noory starts right now.

00:00:38.714 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.695 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:52.695 --> 00:01:00.374 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.374 --> 00:01:01.790 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY:
Right now, indeed,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:10%
and welcome to "Beyond
Belief" is the author

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:10%
of "The Ghost
Rockets," Micah Hanks.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Micah, welcome back.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.393 align:middle line:84%
MICAH HANKS: George,
always good to be here.

00:01:09.393 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This has been a strange
phenomenon, ghost rockets,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know
if they're man-made.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if people are
looking at UFOs in the sky.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:90%
What have you uncovered so far?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:10%
>>HANKS: Well,
first, I would like

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:10%
to open this discussion
with, you know,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.636 align:middle line:10%
a bit of discussion
of terminology.

00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
ghost rockets,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.385 align:middle line:84%
that's a direct
reference to what

00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:84%
was occurring in the
skies over Scandinavia

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:84%
immediately after
the Second World War.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But I borrow that term, being
familiar to UFO researchers,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.380 align:middle line:90%
to discuss a broader phenomenon.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.671 align:middle line:84%
And as I discuss in my book,
"The Ghost Rockets," there

00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
are still reports of
unexplained missile incidents--

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:84%
torpedo-like objects, rockets,
sometimes flying dangerously

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:84%
close to aircraft-- that
are seen in our skies today.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very
perplexing discussion.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
I think it involves
national security interests.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, these things are by
definition unidentified flying

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.070 align:middle line:90%
objects.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And very specifically, narrowing
my focus with this book,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.028 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at
the ones that seem

00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
to represent some sort of a
military type rocket or missile

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:90%
kind of technology.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't believe the
number of reports I've found.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
under guidance?

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.467 align:middle line:84%
Or are they just
shooting off somewhere?

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Some of these, I would
argue, if they're manufactured

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.097 align:middle line:84%
and obviously some sort
of a technological object,

00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
that they are under
some sort of a guidance.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of them seem to kind of
veer along, change direction,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
and do things that
are-- they're pretty

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:84%
unusual for typical
missile and rocket reports.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, when we're
talking about drones,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
this is a big
discussion these days.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, huge.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.289 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Everybody's
talking about drones.

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.456 align:middle line:84%
My local television station
contacted me a while ago

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:39.122 align:middle line:84%
and said, you know,
we see your website.

00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:90%
You talk about this.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:10%
We want to talk about drones
over Asheville, North Carolina.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:10%
And it's just everyone
talking about it.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.739 align:middle line:10%
But again, my
listeners-- I've got

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:10%
a lot of listeners, as you do,
who have worked in government,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.940 align:middle line:10%
people who are in the
know, aerospace, defense,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.292 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of things, technology.

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:54.875 align:middle line:84%
When I talk with
these people, they'll

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:84%
often say, again, there
are known types of drones.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.866 align:middle line:84%
There are corridors by which
many are supposed to be flying.

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
You're not just going to
see a drone just anywhere.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking about
drones almost colliding

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.089 align:middle line:84%
with aircraft, it begins
to be a bit of a problem.

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure does.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.296 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: And so a
lot of the cases

00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:13.342 align:middle line:84%
I look at are reports
by pilots and the like.

00:03:13.342 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's clearly some
sort of a strange phenomena.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Some of these things aren't
just rockets and missiles--

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
rocket-like
technologies but that

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
seem to be something
really far out.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that a little more.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.576 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back to
the Scandinavian case that

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
kicked all of this
into high gear.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.867 align:middle line:90%
What was that case?

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Well, a series of
sightings over Scandinavia

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.539 align:middle line:84%
in the summer of 1946--
we're talking about a wave.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A year before Roswell.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah-- predating the
modern UFO era beginning

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:84%
with Kenneth Arnold over Mount
Rainier, Roswell, New Mexico.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Those are two interesting
cases unto themselves.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
But with the ghost
rockets, we have a number

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
of very unique, singular
things that happen.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
Swedish government

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.102 align:middle line:84%
put together a panel
that was literally

00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:84%
probing to try and
understand this, which hence

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
was the first government
group to study UFOs

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:90%
in modern history.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
They were observing some
sort of a phenomenon,

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and interestingly, the
determination they came to

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.537 align:middle line:84%
was almost identical to
that of the Condon Committee

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:07.620 align:middle line:90%
a couple of decades later.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was that while there
were hundreds of observations--

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.470 align:middle line:84%
on certain days
that summer, there

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:84%
had been hundreds of
reports throughout parts

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:90%
of Scandinavia in single days.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
But the determination
at the end was

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.644 align:middle line:84%
that we couldn't account
for a physical technology.

00:04:20.644 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:90%
We didn't find any shrapnel.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have any really
reliable photographs.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.069 align:middle line:84%
People said they were seeing
something, whatever it was.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:84%
With our current
level of technology,

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.276 align:middle line:84%
we weren't able to
document it, and they

00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:31.910 align:middle line:84%
had to say that it
was mostly probably

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
mass hysteria, although
some members of that panel

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
decades later would actually
confirm for Swedish researchers

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:84%
that we did believe,
many of us on the panel--

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mass hysteria?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: They didn't agree
with that completely.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Some members of the
panel, they said--

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were
people seeing?

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: People
were seeing rockets.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.516 align:middle line:90%
People were seeing missiles.

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
People were seeing things
crashing into lakes.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:84%
People were seeing
things that were flying

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:84%
at extremely fast rate of
speed at high altitude.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think that maybe
war nerves did play into this.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.772 align:middle line:84%
If we want to talk about mass
hysteria, right after the war,

00:04:59.772 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:90%
naturally, people are gonna--

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, that happens.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Yeah, they're
going to be concerned.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there's
always a real case

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.107 align:middle line:90%
that's the catalyst for that.

00:05:06.107 --> 00:05:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yeah.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.431 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then the
hysteria starts.

00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Question, yeah.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.576 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right?

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:10.792 align:middle line:90%
So they've seen something.

00:05:10.792 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Exactly.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's the big
question on my mind.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Question number one-- why is
it that throughout history,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.559 align:middle line:84%
every time people
say by the hundreds

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
that they're seeing
something that we chalk it up

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:90%
to mass hysteria?

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Even Carl Jung, when he was
discussing the idea that maybe

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:84%
this was a psychological
phenomena later with the radar

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
trace cases, he
had to acknowledge

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:84%
there appears to be something
physical happening here.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And unless you or I are
capable or maybe masses

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.795 align:middle line:84%
of creating, manifesting
matter, there

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
would have to be some sort
of a physical phenomenon

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.829 align:middle line:90%
and a source for it.

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that the
ghost rockets in likelihood

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
were probably clandestine
military tests

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:84%
by the Allies, maybe, that
followed the Second World War.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:90%
James Carrion--

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Remnants of Nazis?

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:90%
The war was over.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.986 align:middle line:84%
Could they have still
been doing this?

00:05:51.986 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:10%
>>HANKS: That's an
interesting question

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.920 align:middle line:10%
which gets into a
lot of murky area.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:10%
I would say, again, former
national director of MUFON,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:10%
James Carrion, has written
a book called "The Rosetta

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:10%
Deception"-- offers some
very brilliant points on this

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.160 align:middle line:10%
from a more political
perspective, rather

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160 align:middle line:10%
than my historical
interpretation with the ghost

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.842 align:middle line:10%
rockets.

00:06:07.842 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:90%
But it's still worth reading.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.466 align:middle line:84%
Those two books
together, I think,

00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:90%
give the best explanation.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But with regard to
Nazi technologies,

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
we know that the Nazi
rocket propulsion experts--

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.015 align:middle line:84%
Von Braun, of course,
Hermann Oberth--

00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:84%
they were the ones who
were innovating rocket

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:84%
technology during
the Second World War.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.531 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Thank god we got them.

00:06:23.531 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Thank god, indeed.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And it would be silly to think
that someone wasn't testing

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
that technology after the
Second World War just as well.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:90%
It's obvious.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there was a
propaganda element, just as

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Farrell and other
researchers and Richard Dolan

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
have talked about whether or not
propaganda-- media, government,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
otherwise-- had been utilized
to steer public opinion

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:84%
on those reports, and also,
maybe, with full knowledge

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.730 align:middle line:84%
that government agencies, both
in the East and in the West,

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:84%
would be looking at
those newspaper reports

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and trying to see who had the
biggest weapons, so to speak.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So this doesn't
sound like UFO cases.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Ghost rockets, to me,
sounds like some technology

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:10.684 align:middle line:84%
based on this planet by a nation
that is starting to experiment.

00:07:10.684 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: That's what I
would think, especially

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
in those early cases.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:90%
But now, let's do a 180 here.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-oh.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.677 align:middle line:90%
The twist.

00:07:16.677 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Here's the twist.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Question number two-- what
was seen the same summer

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:84%
as-- I believe he
was actually the head

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:84%
of tactical air command,
Captain Jack Puckett--

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.909 align:middle line:84%
he was flying to
McDill Air Force Base.

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I open the book with
this discussion.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
He said that something
wingless, but

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:84%
a long, rocket-shaped object,
about roughly twice the size

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
of a B29 bomber and
producing a red smoke tail

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:84%
nearly collided
with his aircraft

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:84%
as he was en route to McDill
Air Force Base that morning.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
He said this thing had two
rows of illuminated portholes

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.247 align:middle line:90%
on the side.

00:07:45.247 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're talking about
literally something out

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
of a Buck Rogers episode
here-- a real rocket flying

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:90%
through the air.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:84%
We know, as we've talked
about in the past, George,

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:84%
that it seems highly unlikely
that an alien technology would

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.276 align:middle line:84%
use rockets, in fact, maybe
impossible, to fly from point A

00:08:00.276 --> 00:08:02.650 align:middle line:84%
to point B. They're not going
to use rockets to get here.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would agree.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: But yet, there were
reports and have been reports

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.322 align:middle line:84%
and continue to be reports
of rocket-propelled

00:08:07.322 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:84%
or what seem to be
rocket-propelled

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:84%
not just missiles and rockets,
but aircraft like what

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Jack Puckett described seeing.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I might say that maybe
he had misperceived

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:84%
what he saw if it
weren't for the fact

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.431 align:middle line:84%
that there had been
other reports of a very

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:19.940 align:middle line:90%
similar kind of an aircraft.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they ever
conclude anything specifically?

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: No, but this is what's
so funny, because I often

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.862 align:middle line:84%
have been saying
in recent weeks--

00:08:26.862 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and been getting a little
flak from the UFO community

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
about it, because again, I take
a pretty hard lined approach.

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I say I think we need a new
estimate of the situation.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
We can't be beholden to an
extraterrestrial hypothesis.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:middle line:84%
We need look at quality
statistical analysis

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:90%
of the data.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But what I continue to say
is that this new estimate

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:84%
of the situation needs
to be undertaken.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
they did at the time.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.624 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was Project
Scion under the Air Force.

00:08:47.624 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And what they had said was,
based on the fact, of course,

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.980 align:middle line:84%
that at that time, we
had not as humanity

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.751 align:middle line:84%
been a space faring
civilization ourselves yet,

00:08:55.751 --> 00:08:57.625 align:middle line:84%
their estimation was
this is some technology.

00:08:57.625 --> 00:09:00.330 align:middle line:84%
It seems far enough beyond
what we know to exist.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:90%
It couldn't be ours.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.907 align:middle line:90%
Maybe this is extraterrestrial.

00:09:02.907 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to be clear, that's
what they thought at the time.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.906 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we should
look at it the same way today.

00:09:07.906 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But still, these are
high strangeness cases,

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.500 align:middle line:84%
not just rockets and
missiles-- apparently aircraft,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
apparently manned
aircraft, and something

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
that was far beyond the
known technologies of 1946.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's jump
ahead for a moment.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Just a few years ago, we
talked about a Norway spiral,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:90%
whatever that is.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people thought it
was a Russian rocket.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Other people said,
no, it was some kind

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
of incredible HAARP-like device
that created that spiral look.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yeah.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You remember that?

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:34.495 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Oh, absolutely.

00:09:34.495 --> 00:09:34.995 align:middle line:90%
Oh, god.

00:09:34.995 --> 00:09:35.875 align:middle line:90%
How can I forget?

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And Philip Plait, of course,
in Astronomy Magazine,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.115 align:middle line:84%
listed that among some
of the top UFO sightings

00:09:41.115 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
that ended up being
something after the fact.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: The official
explanation--

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he's
always out to debunk.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: He tends to be.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.579 align:middle line:84%
I think, in fairness--
I like Phillip.

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I do, too.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: I like his writing.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He calls himself
the Bad Astronomer.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yes, exactly.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's really
a good astronomer.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: He's a
great astronomer.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.495 align:middle line:84%
And as an astronomer,
he's doing exactly what

00:09:57.495 --> 00:09:58.502 align:middle line:90%
an astronomer should do.

00:09:58.502 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But in the article
that, of course,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Stanton Friedman and many
of us took issue with,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:84%
he took cases where
it was already

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
known what the phenomenon
over Norway was.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
That was a Russian
missile launch

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.555 align:middle line:84%
that went awry and,
of course, produced

00:10:08.555 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:84%
this interesting
spiral in the sky.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
It seems very clear to me
that that wasn't a UFO,

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.875 align:middle line:84%
so why use that in
a case against UFOs?

00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: It was a missile.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, huh?

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.835 align:middle line:84%
Because in my book,
again, I think

00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:84%
that, while they're
unidentified,

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.876 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these things
are missile tests.

00:10:21.876 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the
Russians ever admit it?

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: I believe that there
was an official explanation.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did they?

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Yeah, I
believe there was.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yeah, again.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting,
because this

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.374 align:middle line:90%
could go both ways, George.

00:10:29.374 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Here we had a purported
UFO that turns out

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to be a missile off the
coast of California, Southern

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.305 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:10:35.305 --> 00:10:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I think it was within a year of
that-- maybe just a few months.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We think the Chinese
did that one, don't we?

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Well,
there's the theory

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:84%
that there was a missile
launch by the Chinese.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
But again, the
official explanation

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.035 align:middle line:84%
had been that it had
been a trick of light

00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and that it was just
an aircraft coming

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:90%
from over the west coast.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.402 align:middle line:90%
Now, I don't know.

00:10:48.402 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.235 align:middle line:84%
It looked an awful lot like
a missile launch to me.

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't say that
the government might not

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
say from time to time that
something is something

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:84%
else so as to dissuade the
public from becoming concerned

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
about what would be interpreted
as an obvious show of force,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:90%
military prowess.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:84%
I would stick with the official
explanation on that one.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.877 align:middle line:84%
But we always have to
be open to question.

00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: But it's
interesting, because we've

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.810 align:middle line:84%
got UFOs that turn
out to be missiles.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:84%
We've got planes that turn
out to be-- or rockets--

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
that we think are
rockets and missiles

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.175 align:middle line:90%
and turn out to be planes.

00:11:19.175 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:84%
It just shows there's a lot
of stuff going on in the sky.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.883 align:middle line:84%
We've got to be very careful
with what we're looking at.

00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But there's, yet
again, clearly, George,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:90%
some tangible phenomena.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.877 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But these do not
sound like UFO-type cases.

00:11:30.877 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Well, it
depends on what we--

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're not
the kind of craft

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.842 align:middle line:84%
that are occupied that
we have been told about.

00:11:38.842 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Exactly.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
When we say "UFO,"
again, the original idea

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:90%
was flying saucer.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I should say
that, in likelihood, there

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.827 align:middle line:84%
may have been other things being
seen over Scandinavia in 1946.

00:11:49.827 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But the term that
was used at the time

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.035 align:middle line:84%
was "missile" or
"rocket," because this

00:11:53.035 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:90%
is what people knew.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.450 align:middle line:84%
A year later, people were
seeing flying saucers.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.215 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget, of course,
that Kenneth Arnold had

00:11:58.215 --> 00:11:59.631 align:middle line:84%
said these things,
initially, they

00:11:59.631 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:84%
looked more like
Chevron-shaped-- fixed wing

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:90%
craft or single wing craft.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like stealth
aircraft, right?

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yes, exactly.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And he described
their mode of flight

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.070 align:middle line:84%
as being erratic like saucers
skipping across water.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:90%
The press latched onto it.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.743 align:middle line:90%
They loved it.

00:12:10.743 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything seen after
that was a flying saucer.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Edward Ruppelt tried
to get away from that.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.063 align:middle line:84%
He said, let's call
these things UFOs.

00:12:16.063 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And yet, here we are, more than
50 years later, you say "UFO,"

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle line:84%
we mean-- you or I--
unidentified flying object,

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.739 align:middle line:90%
but the media says spaceship.

00:12:24.739 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Ghost rockets I don't
think are spaceships.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.738 align:middle line:84%
But they are definitely
unidentified, they're flying,

00:12:28.738 --> 00:12:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're objects,
without question.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.241 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're with
Micah Hanks, of course,

00:12:32.241 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:90%
who's a UFO Researcher.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Micah, you've also
looked at flight TWA 800.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yeah.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.926 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me about this.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And what's the connection
with the things you've done?

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.526 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: I'll tell you this.

00:12:43.526 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a subject I did
not want to write about.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sad story--
for some people

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:84%
who might not remember it,
TWA flight 800, years ago,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.370 align:middle line:84%
leaving New York,
headed for Paris.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:84%
They were in a Boeing
747-- down it went.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:90%
It exploded.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Yeah, over
Long Island Sound.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
The question-- this is
the important thing,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's imperative
to state this from the outset.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
In my book, I
don't make the case

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that it was a missile that
brought down that plane.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.832 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I look at other cases
in the weeks before and after.

00:13:17.832 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And Jim
Sanders, who wrote

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle line:84%
the book "The Downing
of TWA Flight 800,"

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
believes it was a missile
launched by us accidentally

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
that what it really
wanted to do was take down

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:84%
another plane that was going
to try to crash into the 747.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:84%
He thought there was a
terrorist activity going,

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
we were there to try to stop it,
and that the missile took down

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.977 align:middle line:90%
800 instead.

00:13:43.977 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Well, the
late Bill Donaldson

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:84%
with the Association of
Retired Aviation Professionals,

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
he had also believed that
there was-- he thought maybe

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
it was a shoulder
mounted missile launch.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
There had been a number
of speculative theories.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, actually,
a documentary

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.731 align:middle line:84%
that came out, I
believe, two summers

00:13:59.731 --> 00:14:02.549 align:middle line:84%
ago that discussed the
fact that there was indeed

00:14:02.549 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
a lot of new evidence that
seems to show that there was

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:84%
an explosion
external to the plane

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.014 align:middle line:84%
rather than originating
in the central ring--

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Impact.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Yeah, or the
center wing fuel tank,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.145 align:middle line:84%
which is the
official explanation.

00:14:12.145 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: But here's the
problem I have with it, George.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I have, like many researchers--
a good researcher, at least,

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.204 align:middle line:84%
would go and they'd download the
National Transportation Safety

00:14:19.204 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Board documents, read all
the FBI opinions on all this.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And I found that they have a
section in the official NTSB

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:29.612 align:middle line:84%
document that states notable
witness sightings-- witness

00:14:29.612 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:84%
observations of a purported
object moving toward the plane.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes, many saw that.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: There were, I've heard
by some estimates, dozens,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.354 align:middle line:90%
maybe hundreds.

00:14:38.354 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is is that
there are two or three that

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:84%
are listed among about
a dozen in the report.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.821 align:middle line:84%
These are the
notable cases, sure.

00:14:44.821 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing is
is that there were

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.861 align:middle line:84%
a number-- Paul
Angelides, I believe,

00:14:47.861 --> 00:14:49.906 align:middle line:84%
was one of the gentlemen--
a lot of people

00:14:49.906 --> 00:14:52.030 align:middle line:84%
who said there was clearly
an object seen flying up

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.020 align:middle line:90%
toward the plane.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I thought, because
I'm writing about missiles

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.413 align:middle line:84%
and rockets, I've
got to look at that.

00:14:56.413 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But what I found is
really, really incredible.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.229 align:middle line:84%
Again, the-- Bill
Donaldson and his team

00:15:02.229 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:84%
who were investigating
this-- former flight

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.342 align:middle line:84%
investigators themselves,
crash investigators-- they

00:15:06.342 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:84%
found numerous
reports in the weeks

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
leading up to and after of what
looked like missiles or rockets

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.986 align:middle line:84%
flying in that vicinity
over Long Island Sound, some

00:15:12.986 --> 00:15:15.001 align:middle line:84%
of them, George, shooting
up out of the ocean.

00:15:15.001 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:90%
And there was one that--

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.041 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Submarine-based.

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Maybe so-- one
that our friend, of course,

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Peter Davenport of the
National UFO Reporting Center--

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.880 align:middle line:84%
he got a transcript of
the audio from Lufthansa

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and also a British
Airways flight

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.739 align:middle line:84%
that were heading over Long
Island Sound leaving JFK.

00:15:27.739 --> 00:15:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And they had had a
dialogue about something

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
at about 3,000 feet
altitude above them

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.792 align:middle line:84%
and flying in the
opposite direction

00:15:33.792 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:84%
but maintaining a
horizontal flight

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.749 align:middle line:84%
path-- a green,
rocket-like object.

00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the question.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.030 align:middle line:84%
If these were rockets seen
coming up out of the base

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and flying over,
whose were they?

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Why were they in this
well-trafficked area

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:90%
off the coast of New York?

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And if there were
reports of rockets

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.220 align:middle line:84%
before and after TWA
flight 800, does that

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.017 align:middle line:84%
change the way we
look at that case?

00:15:54.017 --> 00:15:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Those are questions that--

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could have been
a horrible accident,

00:15:56.975 --> 00:15:57.850 align:middle line:90%
a tragic accident.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:58.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Very well possible.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I do know, and
I remember that night,

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
when they explained
it that way, to me, it

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.880 align:middle line:84%
sounded like a
terrorist activity.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Were you on
the air that night?

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I sure was.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.228 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Oh, boy.

00:16:07.228 --> 00:16:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I
just felt-- it was

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
in St. Louis I was
on-- that there

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:90%
was some terrorist activity.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
Bill Clinton trying

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
to temper that so
people wouldn't panic.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to kill
the aviation industry.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.988 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: No, of course.

00:16:23.988 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And even the FBI had been
open to that possibility

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:26.852 align:middle line:90%
at the outset.

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everybody did.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Everyone was
looking at the possibility

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:90%
that there was a terrorist act.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.421 align:middle line:84%
And now, of course, in
a post-9/11 America,

00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:35.760 align:middle line:84%
we know to what extent terrorist
acts can be taken against

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.390 align:middle line:84%
the United States and
with horrific effect.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.477 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is that
the American physicist who

00:16:41.477 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
was the primary--
his name escapes me,

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:84%
but he was featured in
the recent documentary.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And he appeared on
Fox News discussing

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.422 align:middle line:84%
with the FBI director at the
time some of the new evidence.

00:16:49.422 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And the FBI director,
rather than saying,

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.280 align:middle line:84%
look, that's all bunk,
there's nothing to this,

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:84%
he gets a little upset,
a little flustered, even.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I have to say
that if there are investigators

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.870 align:middle line:84%
who were involved--
FBI, NTSB, whoever,

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.570 align:middle line:84%
in this original investigation--
if they're only coming forward

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:90%
now, then they were cowards.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to shake the boat.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:84%
After the fact,
to come forward--

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was hot under
the collar, wasn't he?

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Yeah, but he said, if
they are coming forward now,

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.188 align:middle line:84%
why didn't they
say something then?

00:17:14.188 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say that
they were wrong.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:84%
He said, why are they
coming forward now?

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Which left it open
to my interpretation

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that, well, maybe people are
saying, OK, is there still

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:84%
or are there still maybe
a number of questions

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:90%
about TWA flight 800?

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:90%
I think there are.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the fact that
you have looked at that

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:84%
and you investigate
UFOs-- sounds

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:90%
like you're into mysteries.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: I'm into mysteries.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:84%
UFOs, I think, are one big
piece of the puzzle, George,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.354 align:middle line:84%
and I think a puzzle that
often takes place in our skies.

00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's an
interesting question

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:84%
we should ask about
UFOs in itself.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.754 align:middle line:84%
We see them coming from
the sky when they take off

00:17:47.754 --> 00:17:49.295 align:middle line:84%
and they fly off at
incredible speed.

00:17:49.295 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:90%
They fly off into the sky.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that they're
coming from the sky?

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that this interpretation
of the UFO phenomenon

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:84%
in the broader sense as
being extraterrestrial

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.974 align:middle line:84%
stems from our inability, the
complete escape from reality.

00:18:00.974 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where they
come from or what they are.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But with the ghost
rocket cases, again, I

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.424 align:middle line:84%
do think that we're
looking at probably

00:18:06.424 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:90%
a terrestrial phenomenon.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:84%
But who's operating these
things behind the scenes?

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some people think that
they could be time travelers,

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.575 align:middle line:90%
ours coming back.

00:18:14.575 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: I have entertained
that possibility a few times.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have?

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Yeah, maybe
not in relation

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:90%
to the ghost rocket cases.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
time travel is somehow

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.525 align:middle line:84%
related to UFOs in the broader
scope of things-- I certainly

00:18:25.525 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:84%
think that may be the
case, although I prefer

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.470 align:middle line:84%
to use the term temporally
evasive technology,

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:84%
because the way I see this
is, again, that, really, time

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
is probably a perceptual
illusion that we

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:90%
as humans perceive.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:90%
We perceive right now.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:84%
But every time I say,
George, "right now,"

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:90%
that was a second ago.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And we perceive that
the future's yet to come

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:46.535 align:middle line:84%
and we have the past that's
already been behind us.

00:18:46.535 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Stephen Hawking, of
course, says that our mind

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.030 align:middle line:90%
interprets memory, the past.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:84%
We remember the past
because our brains function

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:84%
in the same direction in
which entropy increases.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we, coming
back to the sensory idea,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.930 align:middle line:84%
are basically beholden to the
way we have evolved to operate.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.265 align:middle line:84%
But really, our physicists say
that time really may be fixed,

00:19:05.265 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and that really, past, present,
and future may all exist.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:90%
We're just operating within it.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.361 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case, what if
there's a technology that's

00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:12.862 align:middle line:84%
learned to get
around the temporal--

00:19:12.862 --> 00:19:14.027 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they come back.

00:19:14.027 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Yeah, or
they go forward.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.357 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: I spoke with
Eric Von Daniken once.

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And he had said, you know,
the original title of my book

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.647 align:middle line:84%
had been "Memories
From the Future."

00:19:22.647 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think,
such an interesting way

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:84%
to perceive the UFO phenomena--
a memory, like Hawking would

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:84%
talk about in relation to
the way we perceive memories,

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:90%
but from the future.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So there is almost
a way you could

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:84%
tie in a psychic
component to some of this.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And it all comes back to
human perception to me.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I think that a
nontemporal phenomenon-- time

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:84%
travel, maybe, for the layman--
could be a part of this.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Some say the Nazis
possessed UFO technology--

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.470 align:middle line:10%
that they stumbled
across it with perhaps

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:10%
a retrieved saucer-- and that's
why they had technology that

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:10%
was so far ahead
of everybody else,

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:10%
and had we not developed the
atomic weapon before them,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.269 align:middle line:10%
I'm convinced Hitler would have
used it all over the planet.

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yes.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:84%
I have spoken to-- I first read
about that idea, by the way,

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.957 align:middle line:90%
in Joseph Farrell's writing.

00:20:12.957 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I've got a friend who
is a historian and who

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
has looked into that
and actually discussed

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.722 align:middle line:90%
this with intelligence himself.

00:20:19.722 --> 00:20:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to everyone
I can about that.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And the direction that
that all seems to go

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.350 align:middle line:84%
is that the Nazis were
trying to do the same thing

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.367 align:middle line:84%
that the Allies were--
that anyone would

00:20:28.367 --> 00:20:29.700 align:middle line:90%
have tried to do during wartime.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.579 align:middle line:84%
They A, wanted to
win, and B, they

00:20:31.579 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
were willing to do
that at all costs.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea that there
had been a super weapon on par

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.040 align:middle line:90%
with an atomic bomb--

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They
would have used it.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: There's
some good evidence

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:84%
that there were tests
over the Baltic Sea.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.286 align:middle line:84%
There was an electromagnetic
pulse that occurred afterward

00:20:44.286 --> 00:20:47.590 align:middle line:84%
that knocked out the grid
in Germany-- specifically

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.025 align:middle line:90%
in Berlin-- that same weekend.

00:20:49.025 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And not too difficult
to knock out a grid then.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.087 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Not then,
not now, even.

00:20:53.087 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.644 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: So I think that we
have to take into consideration

00:20:56.644 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
there were incredible
technologies

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:90%
the Nazis possessed.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.797 align:middle line:84%
But if they had had things on
par with UFOs and time travel,

00:21:02.797 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
as we hear about Die Glocke
and some of these conspiracy

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.615 align:middle line:84%
theories, I have to ask,
why didn't they win the war?

00:21:07.615 --> 00:21:10.701 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's a mixture
of what we think maybe they had

00:21:10.701 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:90%
and actual technologies.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, maybe they just
didn't have it ready in time.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: I would
say this-- and this

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:84%
is part of the atrocious
aspect of Nazism in general--

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.406 align:middle line:90%
they had hatred for minorities.

00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And they, because, I think, of,
for instance, Albert Einstein's

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
heritage, wanted their
own kind of physics.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want a Jewish
perspective on physics.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to do
their own physics, which

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
may have led them to doing
some very interesting things.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.597 align:middle line:84%
And to me, they may not
have been successful,

00:21:37.597 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:84%
but they were willing
to try anything.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.555 align:middle line:84%
And they were even
willing to get

00:21:40.555 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:84%
into some of the strange
occult belief, too.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Hitler was
deeply into the occult.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.283 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Very.

00:21:45.283 --> 00:21:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He wanted that.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:84%
The Indiana Jones series,
which depict the Nazis looking

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.771 align:middle line:84%
for the Ark of the Covenant,
and things like-- that's true.

00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yeah, a lot of it is.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did that.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.216 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: They certainly did.

00:21:57.216 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were obsessed, even,
with these secret powers

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and ways that they could
turn the tides of the war.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe some
of that actually

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:84%
led them to developing or coming
at very-- at least very close

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:84%
to developing incredible
Wunderwaffen magical weapons

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:12.817 align:middle line:90%
of sorts.

00:22:12.817 --> 00:22:14.150 align:middle line:90%
I think that had been their aim.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Whether they got
there is debatable.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But I don't doubt,
George, I don't

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.650 align:middle line:84%
doubt that the idea had probably
been propagated after the war,

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
especially by the
Allies, for purpose

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.282 align:middle line:84%
of trying to convince
other intelligences

00:22:25.282 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
around the world-- and I'm
talking about specifically

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:84%
probably Russia--
that we had captured

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.980 align:middle line:84%
highly advanced
Nazi technologies.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:90%
A brief example.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:84%
A New York Times report
right after the war

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:84%
discussed seeing a saucer-like
craft hovering over the Thames

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.410 align:middle line:84%
River during the war, which
is an incredible report--

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:42.970 align:middle line:90%
a saucer?

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: And I think a
lot of people look at that

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and they say, wow, that
seems like a very valid UFO

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
report that ties
the Nazis to it.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.292 align:middle line:84%
But it seems more,
to me, more likely

00:22:50.292 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
that that would
have been something

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.333 align:middle line:84%
that we know would
have been put right

00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:84%
out in the open-- Russian
intelligence finds this

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and they think, my god, what
have the Allies captured?

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.254 align:middle line:90%
What has America got?

00:22:59.254 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
What did they get from
Germany that we didn't?

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.615 align:middle line:84%
What was going on over
there, Peenemunde,

00:23:03.615 --> 00:23:04.490 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't about?

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some of the
ghost rockets actually

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:84%
fell into that just
as well-- tests

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.043 align:middle line:84%
from things that were actually
captured, or at the very least,

00:23:11.043 --> 00:23:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the information thereafter
that was released

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
with purpose of
psychological warfare.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a really complex web we
start to see emerge with--

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.291 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's huge.

00:23:18.291 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yeah.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to ask
you about a subject I

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.400 align:middle line:90%
know you're familiar with.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much
you've researched it.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:29.530 align:middle line:84%
But the 1952 UFO flap
over Washington, DC--

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:35.760 align:middle line:84%
captured, great picture in
the newspapers at the time.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.020 align:middle line:84%
People actually
witnessed something

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.470 align:middle line:84%
hovering over the capital,
many objects over the capital,

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.560 align:middle line:90%
in 1952.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on that?

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Well, that's
an interesting case.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.805 align:middle line:84%
I know Edward Ruppelt, of
course, wrote about that.

00:23:48.805 --> 00:23:50.560 align:middle line:84%
It's often said that,
well, Ruppelt also

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:84%
recanted all his
positions on UFOs.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't think he did.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: I don't know
that he did, either.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:84%
I know that he offered
a second edition

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.787 align:middle line:90%
of that book which was very odd.

00:23:57.787 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he had Project Blue
Book at the time, did he not?

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Well, he
had at the time, yes.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And I still maintain his book,
"The Report on Unidentified

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Flying Objects," no matter
which version you read,

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is one of the best
books written on UFOs.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think so, too.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: And he talked
about that case.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
there were actually

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:84%
radar traces of those objects
hovering over Washington.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.895 align:middle line:90%
First of all, this has--

00:24:14.895 --> 00:24:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they panicked.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Yeah, they
panicked, because this

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.110 align:middle line:84%
is one of the greatest
national security threats.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
More interesting
to me, though, is

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the very
same thing actually

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:23.920 align:middle line:90%
happened the other day.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear about this?

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell me.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.473 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: There was actually
a report just the other day.

00:24:27.473 --> 00:24:29.160 align:middle line:90%
This would have been a week ago.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And there was what was described
as a nautilus-shaped white

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
object that was hovering
directly over Washington.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:90%
People took photos of it.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.555 align:middle line:10%
People who do news for my
site, gralienreport.com,

00:24:38.555 --> 00:24:40.680 align:middle line:10%
were sending me links and
saying, did you see this?

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.396 align:middle line:10%
I'm thinking, no.

00:24:41.396 --> 00:24:42.770 align:middle line:10%
The reason I didn't
see it-- I've

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.420 align:middle line:10%
got news filters set up
to look for news stories

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.524 align:middle line:10%
that say "UFO."

00:24:46.524 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
UFO was never
mentioned, but there

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:84%
were photos of a white
object believed to be maybe

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.905 align:middle line:84%
a high altitude balloon, some
sort of a secret aircraft.

00:24:52.905 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Something was--

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A drone?

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.634 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: I don't know, but it
hovered for some 45 minutes

00:24:56.634 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:90%
over Washington, DC.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.184 align:middle line:84%
NORAD said that it wasn't a
high altitude balloon test.

00:25:01.184 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the meteorological
experts who were questioned

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.370 align:middle line:84%
said there were no
weather balloons.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, after
9/11, my ability

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:84%
to be confident in
NORAD has changed a lot.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Well, maybe so,
although I think that they've

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.170 align:middle line:84%
really ramped up their--
literally, if anything is seen

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:84%
in air space, as we're told, at
least, that seems questionable,

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:90%
NORAD, they're scrambling jets.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
interesting thing.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.126 align:middle line:84%
They said that they didn't
know what this thing was.

00:25:22.126 --> 00:25:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore,
to my knowledge,

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.650 align:middle line:84%
there was no scrambling
of jets by NORAD.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:27.026 align:middle line:84%
So what was seen
over Washington?

00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:28.441 align:middle line:84%
Now, it could have
been a balloon.

00:25:28.441 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And in this modern
era-- again, I

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
look at a lot of the
ghost rocket reports

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:90%
as probably being drones.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.216 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was a drone, but
George, the military drones

00:25:35.216 --> 00:25:36.090 align:middle line:90%
aren't the only ones.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:38.465 align:middle line:84%
There are the civilian
drones just as well.

00:25:38.465 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking whoever-- if
that was somebody operating

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.027 align:middle line:84%
a drone over
Washington, DC-- last

00:25:43.027 --> 00:25:44.360 align:middle line:90%
place they should be doing that.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did we scramble?

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: I don't think we did.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.526 align:middle line:84%
And to my knowledge, there's
no official explanation

00:25:48.526 --> 00:25:50.624 align:middle line:90%
as to what was actually seen.

00:25:50.624 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:84%
But these kinds of things
happen all over the place.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.800 align:middle line:84%
There's been kind of a
wave of UFO sightings

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.100 align:middle line:84%
over Southern
California recently.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.020 align:middle line:84%
One gentleman sent
me a story of two

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:84%
what looked like huge--
bigger than Goodyear blimps--

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.940 align:middle line:84%
but huge, blimp-like
objects flying in formation,

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.180 align:middle line:90%
completely silent.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And they had beacons,
white lights,

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.610 align:middle line:84%
that were pulsing on the
front, blue sparks, he said,

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:90%
that shot out the back.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But he said the strangest
thing about these two craft.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:84%
He said, my girlfriend
and I watched them.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:90%
It was 10:30 PM.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:90%
We were in Beaumont, California.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:90%
As they flew overhead--

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Silent?

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: Silent-- and he said
that the light that illuminated

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:84%
them so that we
could see the shape

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.530 align:middle line:84%
revealed these huge craft
that seemed worn out,

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:90%
like they were older.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:28.850 align:middle line:90%
That seemed so strange to me.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.628 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: So there's so much
going on in our air space that,

00:26:31.628 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
again, is not being
officially discussed.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How much is our
technology, how much is

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:37.927 align:middle line:84%
unknown technology,
in your opinion?

00:26:37.927 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: In my opinion, I
think the majority of it

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:90%
is probably our technology.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.852 align:middle line:84%
And you read every day
about DARPA's stealth blimp

00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
or the idea that the
Defense Department's

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.726 align:middle line:84%
working on high altitude
blimps and dirigible craft.

00:26:47.726 --> 00:26:50.594 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Things we saw 10 years
ago, they're just using today.

00:26:50.594 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: They were probably
using them 10 years ago,

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.895 align:middle line:90%
maybe 20 years ago.

00:26:53.895 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:90%
That's just it.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah,
that could be, too.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.748 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: What we know
about-- I've always

00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:84%
been told by my
friends, aviation

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.130 align:middle line:84%
historians and the
like, they'll always

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
say that what you think we have
that's state of the art today

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
we had 30 years ago-- computers,
aircraft, the whole works.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee you,
there's stuff out

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:90%
there that's so beyond belief--

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that
they're working on.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I think they're working
on anti-gravity devices.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.197 align:middle line:90%
You name it, they've got it.

00:27:15.197 --> 00:27:16.613 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: They may
already have it.

00:27:16.613 --> 00:27:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But is it all
reversed engineered technology

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.254 align:middle line:90%
from a UFO?

00:27:20.254 --> 00:27:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: I don't know.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:23.737 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or are we that
smart to come up with this?

00:27:23.737 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: I would like to
say that maybe humans had

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:84%
the ability to come up
with this and to find

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:28.500 align:middle line:90%
these things ourselves.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.125 align:middle line:84%
But that is a whole
different question.

00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:84%
George, if that's the case, then
why has this information not

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:90%
been publicly available?

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:84%
How has the secret
been kept so well?

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And I talk with
different people who

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.640 align:middle line:90%
have background in government.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.306 align:middle line:84%
Colonel John Alexander
talks about this.

00:27:41.306 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
He says, I've looked
in all echelons

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:90%
of government available to me.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.505 align:middle line:90%
I find no interest in--

00:27:45.505 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no secret.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yeah.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't cover it up.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: And so sometimes,
George, just to be honest,

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:52.630 align:middle line:84%
I have to look at this as
being either something, maybe,

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.310 align:middle line:84%
that's earthly but
extra governmental.

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But that seems almost impossible
in our information age,

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.570 align:middle line:90%
in a post-Snowden release era.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's something
else going on.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:84%
The mind reels at
the possibilities.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Area 51-- what
the heck is going on there?

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.037 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: That's an interesting
story, because officially,

00:28:14.037 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:84%
it's been acknowledged
now, as a result of release

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:90%
of information--

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That it exists.

00:28:17.545 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yes.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:22.270 align:middle line:84%
The CIA, of course-- their
documentation about everything

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:27.825 align:middle line:84%
from the B2s and the U2s, the
stealth programs, basically,

00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:30.450 align:middle line:84%
spy planes and things during the
'50s, which I do think account

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of the--

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:31.808 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:28:31.808 --> 00:28:33.539 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: --a lot
of the UFO reports.

00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:35.830 align:middle line:84%
But with Area 51, maybe
there's a little more going on.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.260 align:middle line:84%
There was a story
recently, in fact,

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.426 align:middle line:84%
in the news, that was talking
about new runways that

00:28:39.426 --> 00:28:43.684 align:middle line:84%
appear on satellite
imagery of Area 51.

00:28:43.684 --> 00:28:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Coming back to
Bill Cooper-- we've

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:84%
discussed him
before in the past.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Bill Cooper had spent a lot
of time looking out there.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.501 align:middle line:84%
And he said that there were
all kinds of strange lights

00:28:50.501 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and things that appeared
in the sky over Area 51.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And then there seems
to be-- although it's

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.370 align:middle line:84%
been called into question
in the past-- what

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that at times is
some compelling information

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that guys like Robert Lazar
have brought to the table.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know most of the
UFO community says--

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.279 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's either way
off or he's really accurate.

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Let me tell you what--

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no in between.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HANKS: --what
compels me about some

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:10%
of what Robert Lazar--
what Bob Lazar has said

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.890 align:middle line:10%
is that-- there are
videos of him online.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:17.297 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people don't know this.

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:10%
And the kind of technology
he's working with right

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.735 align:middle line:10%
now-- I think he's got,
actually, a company.

00:29:21.735 --> 00:29:23.610 align:middle line:84%
He sells everything from
Geiger counters to--

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:24.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Alternative
energy and everything else

00:29:24.985 --> 00:29:25.610 align:middle line:90%
he's looking for.

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:25.716 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yeah.

00:29:25.716 --> 00:29:28.080 align:middle line:10%
And he's also, of course,
contracted from time to time

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.776 align:middle line:10%
to carry out
projects and things.

00:29:29.776 --> 00:29:31.650 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me he's got
a background in this.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:33.590 align:middle line:84%
He's still doing this
sort of thing today.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:84%
To me, his testimony seems
more than just a charlatan

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:90%
who was trying to get attention.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But that brings to mind
a couple of questions.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Was he telling the truth?

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.315 align:middle line:84%
Was he told not
to tell the truth?

00:29:44.315 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he a
misinformation person?

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.523 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: Yeah.

00:29:46.523 --> 00:29:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've been
shown with Majestic 12 that

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.021 align:middle line:90%
has happened.

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:51.770 align:middle line:84%
There people out there,
like Richard Doty,

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.603 align:middle line:84%
who have been involved
in giving information

00:29:53.603 --> 00:29:56.160 align:middle line:84%
that good, meticulous
researchers, like Robert

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.445 align:middle line:84%
Hastings, have worked
to try and disprove.

00:29:58.445 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's easy to throw
a curve ball at people.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: It really is.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
have to be careful.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HANKS: We have
to be careful not

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to become beholden to
belief, because as soon

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.840 align:middle line:84%
as we think we know
what's going to happen,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.490 align:middle line:84%
every idea is going
to be thrown out.

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Micah, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: My pleasure, George.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.458 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Appreciate it.

00:30:11.458 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Good luck in everything you
do in your continual research

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.960 align:middle line:90%
into this important field.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HANKS: I appreciate it.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.083 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's great to
know we've got people

00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:20.540 align:middle line:84%
like Micah Hanks out
there researching, getting

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.710 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom line of the
question of do UFOs exist,

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and if so, where
do they come from?

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:31.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:47.367 align:middle line:90%
