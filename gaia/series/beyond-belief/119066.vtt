00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.338 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:09.338 --> 00:00:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.260 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>>It felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.389 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:10%
Now, you know watching
this program over the years

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:10%
that we have dealt with
many psychic mediums, people

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:10%
who deal with the other side.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And we've got that again
for you on this edition

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.380 align:middle line:90%
of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
But you might want
to ask yourself,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:84%
what is an intuition
development expert?

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:90%
My gosh, what does that mean?

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, take a look.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSANNE WILSON: Hi, my
name is Susanne Wilson.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm a psychic medium,
consultant, and teacher.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:10%
As a child, I knew
I was different

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:10%
because I could tune in to
colors and energies and spirit

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.940 align:middle line:10%
around people.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But I also learned
that not everyone

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.530 align:middle line:84%
saw the world the
same way that I

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:84%
did so I learned to hide my
abilities at a very young age.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:84%
During my life, I
have pursued what

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:90%
you would call "being normal."

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.020 align:middle line:90%
I've been married over 25 years.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I have a bachelor's
degree, master's degree,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:84%
certifications-- pursued a very
successful corporate career.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:10%
But all the while, I felt
like a part of me was missing.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:10%
I would secretly go to
psychic development seminars,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:10%
study with mentors and
teachers and read books

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:10%
and very quietly on
the side do readings

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:10%
for friends and
friends of friends.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is until 2007, when
spirit got my attention.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I had a near-death
experience that

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
caused me to focus on what
was really important to me

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and that is using
the gift that I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
have to help others
to live a life filled

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:90%
what purpose and peace.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe that each
of us have gifts

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:90%
that have been given to us.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:84%
It is our job to identify
them and leverage

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
them to help others and to
also grow ourselves as souls.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:90%
I teach spiritual development.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:10%
I also give readings and
teach Reiki and seminars.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I can work with people
by telephone or in person

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
at my office in Carefree,
Arizona, just outside Phoenix

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:90%
and Scottsdale.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Whatever work that
I do with a client,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:84%
my goal is that I will
receive information

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:84%
that is for the client's
best and highest good.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for allowing me
to introduce myself today.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
My name is Susanne Wilson and my
website is carefreemedium.com.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.555 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well,
there you have it.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:84%
That's an intuition
development expert.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But Susanne Wilson is also
an evidential psychic medium.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: Well, George, an
evidential psychic medium

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:10%
focuses on linking to the
loved one that's coming through

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:10%
for the client and blending
our energies together

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.000 align:middle line:10%
so that we can pick up
those little details that

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:10%
are so important.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:10%
Like just the other
day, I had someone

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:10%
coming through and in
my mind, I'm saying,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:10%
give me something so that
they know it's really you.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:10%
And what I heard was
"one yellow rose."

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:10%
So I said, your mom is saying
"one yellow rose" to you.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:10%
And she says, nobody knows I put
one yellow rose in her coffin

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.949 align:middle line:10%
right before she was buried.

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.815 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: So that's the
kind of evidence you want.

00:03:56.815 --> 00:03:58.648 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's chilling
when you hear that.

00:03:58.648 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:90%
It's really chilling.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So we just got a
little glimpse of you

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and your life, just
a little glimpse.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But you had mentioned that you
had a near-death experience.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.457 align:middle line:84%
Do you care to
share that with us?

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Sure.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:10%
In 2007, I was undergoing
allergy testing,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:10%
where they punch your arms
and they put the allergens in.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just to
see what swells up.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Exactly.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.312 align:middle line:84%
And I had already
had one appointment.

00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:23.895 align:middle line:84%
This was the second
appointment, where

00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
they give you a lot more
of the stuff they put in.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, my
throat's getting tight.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling hot.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And the technician
at first said, well,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
we'll just turn up
the air conditioning.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, no, no.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.115 align:middle line:90%
I'm really sick.

00:04:38.115 --> 00:04:38.823 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, boy.

00:04:38.823 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: She left the room.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, how long are you going
to die in a doctor's office?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:10%
Not very long, right?

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.074 align:middle line:10%
It turns out it
doesn't take that long.

00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You had a reaction
to one of those little--

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.906 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: I did.

00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:10%
Oh my gosh--

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.441 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Pinpricks?

00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: My throat started
honking like a goose

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:10%
and then it just closed off.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And as the doctors were
running in the room,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:84%
I stepped backwards
and out of my body.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa!

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: I thought,
OK, this is it.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, it turns out I
didn't want to come back.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I only had a few seconds but I
was hearing this amazing music,

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.026 align:middle line:84%
like thousands of
voices singing.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You really wanted
to stay on the other side?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.485 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Oh, it was great.

00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I felt the arms of my
grandfather all around me

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, I have
never felt this good.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.717 align:middle line:10%
And then, I could see people
in the room with my body--

00:05:32.717 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Panicking--

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: Holding me up.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:10%
Oh, they're panicked,
all right, and they were

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:10%
getting an injection ready.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:10%
And it's like they're
moving in slow motion.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:10%
All the people look
flat and shiny.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:10%
It's different perspective
when you're not in the body.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:10%
When I saw the needle
get jabbed into my arm,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:10%
I was very rudely vacuum-sucked
back into my body.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Was it like adrenaline
they were shooting into you?

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.845 align:middle line:10%
Epinephrine?

00:05:57.845 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: Yeah.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.090 align:middle line:10%
And even in the ambulance,
I was lying there going,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:10%
why did heaven reject me?

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.650 align:middle line:90%
That place was nice.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.165 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was it-- did you
find out what reaction you had

00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:90%
to what?

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: No, we never
found out and so many things

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.419 align:middle line:90%
lit up on my arm.

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.501 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That would have
been nice to know, right,

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:17.921 align:middle line:10%
because that could happen again.

00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: Well,
then maybe I'll just

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.210 align:middle line:10%
keep going into the
light next time.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:10%
But this time, I had
heard a voice say,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:10%
your work hasn't started yet.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.940 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, are
you kidding me?

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:10%
I've got my degrees.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:10%
I've been working really hard.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:10%
What work?

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't think about
it again for several weeks.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So when you
came back, did you

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:84%
find that you were more
tuned in to the other side?

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: I found that
I couldn't tune out

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.030 align:middle line:10%
the other side.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:10%
Before this, I had been
ashamed of the abilities

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.829 align:middle line:10%
that I was born with.

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: I felt it just
was too woo-woo, too

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:10%
crazy, plus there were a lot of
religious people in my family.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:10%
So I hid in the closet-- I
call it the "psychic closet"--

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:10%
for a very long time.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:10%
And I was interested in
developing the abilities

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:10%
because I knew I had them.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:10%
I had them since birth.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.610 align:middle line:10%
But I kept it secret when
I would go to a seminar

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.625 align:middle line:10%
and I studied in the '90s
with James Van Praagh, who

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:10%
was one of my first teachers.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.838 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Know him well.

00:07:22.838 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: Great
teacher, amazing.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Lots of energy.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.090 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: Yes but I
wouldn't tell anybody

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:10%
that I did that on the
weekend and then came back

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.660 align:middle line:10%
to my corporate job.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:10%
What happened is
I'd be in a meeting

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:10%
and I could see
everybody's auras.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:10%
I could see all their spirit
people lining up around them.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, now,
I need to go get help

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:10%
after this near-death
experience to know

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.340 align:middle line:10%
how to manage this thing.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So you are convinced
beyond a shadow of a doubt

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.260 align:middle line:10%
that the other side is real.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:10%
It exists.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:10%
It's there.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: We have
nothing to fear.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:10%
It's there.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't want
to get there too early

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.425 align:middle line:84%
but there's nothing
to worry about there.

00:08:06.425 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: Well, from
what the dead tell me

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:10%
and that's what I base all
of my list of suppositions

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:10%
and my beliefs, we have
different access exit

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:10%
points built into our life.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:10%
And on a soul level, we may or
may not take that exit point.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:10%
But when we do,
there is no pain.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:10%
Now, the process of being sick
or being injured or whatever

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:10%
happens that leads
up to the death

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:10%
could have pain but
the transition itself

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.570 align:middle line:10%
is pain-free and beautiful.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:40.039 align:middle line:10%
They talk about going to
wonderful welcome-home parties

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:10%
and seeing their dog or
their cat and their grandma

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:10%
or grandpa and meeting ancestors
they've never met before,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:10%
who know all about
them because they've

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:10%
been following their lives.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.500 align:middle line:10%
Who wouldn't be looking
forward to something like that?

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the
demonic side of death?

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:90%
We hear so much about that.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Did you witness any of that when
you had that very brief death

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:90%
encounter?

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: No, it was
all loving and positive

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:10%
but there is a dark side
to connecting with spirit.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm not a Pollyanna, fluffy
person saying, it's all good.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:10%
It's all love.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:10%
If your light is bright--
and your light is bright

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:10%
when you're tuned
in-- then that's

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:10%
going to attract whatever
is interested in you.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm very careful
about teaching grounding

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.990 align:middle line:90%
and protection-- discernment.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:10%
I would say, just like
in the general population

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:10%
here on the planet.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:10%
Let's say 3% of
people are dangerous.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what the
percent really is.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.202 align:middle line:10%
Well, as on earth, so in heaven.

00:09:47.202 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It's the same thing.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.326 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: Pretty much.

00:09:49.326 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You've got that.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I had read a long
time ago that there

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.610 align:middle line:84%
are different levels
on the other side,

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.690 align:middle line:84%
that the higher the
level, the closer you

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:84%
get to that perfection--
call it "heaven."

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But on the lower levels,
it might be considered hell

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want
to be around there.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And I had read a book
by Hereward Carrington

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and Sylvan Muldoon called "The
Projection of the Astral Body,"

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.370 align:middle line:84%
where they talk
about these levels

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and that sometimes when you're
in your astral state, which

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:84%
is almost like the
dying state, you

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:84%
get to these different levels
or you have to go through them.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And they had talked about
how on the lower level,

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
entities are trying to
grab them and capture them

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever talk to anybody
who has experienced that, where

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:84%
they went through
those horrible levels

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:90%
to get to the higher level?

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:10%
>>WILSON: I have brought through
spirits who were addicted,

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:10%
who were selling drugs, who
were involved in violent acts,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.820 align:middle line:10%
and they've told me
that the creator never

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:10%
turned his back on them, that
there was always an opportunity

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:10%
to move on to a higher level
and that self-forgiveness

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:10%
was the most important step
and that they did progress.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:10%
And then, I've
also done readings

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.135 align:middle line:10%
for people who have sat down
in front of me and I'm like,

00:11:16.135 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:10%
oh, there's dark energy
around this person

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.780 align:middle line:10%
because the lower
entities, they vibe

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:10%
towards places where
bad things are happening

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:10%
and people who are negative.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:10%
But the bottom line is,
it is never too late.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Even after death, it's not
too late to improve your soul

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.109 align:middle line:84%
and improve where you live
because they live over there.

00:11:40.109 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:90%
The dead are alive.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's always room
for growth, isn't there?

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Exactly.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So as you were telling
me that you give readings

00:11:45.425 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
to people, what can
people expect in a reading

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:90%
and what are they looking for?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.500 align:middle line:84%
What are you looking
for as the medium?

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: About 10 or 15
minutes before the reading,

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:90%
I have the client's first name.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:84%
That's all I want and I
write their first name

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:90%
on the top of a piece of paper.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, I start doing
automatic writing.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: And things
will start coming in.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll make some notes.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I also welcome their spiritual
team, their guides, angels,

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:90%
loved ones in the light.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And I talk to them
and say, welcome.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you're here.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm the medium.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Nothing gets through
unless I put it through.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
You must have this client's
best interests at heart.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:90%
You must care about them.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Please give me whatever
evidence that you

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.360 align:middle line:90%
can to prove that it's you.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:90%
I can see, hear, and feel you.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:84%
My preferred way is for you to
put the information directly

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
in my mind as a very
clear, spontaneous thought

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:84%
but please use whichever
method is best for you.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, I introduce
them to my spiritual team

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.287 align:middle line:84%
that will help them
with the communication.

00:12:46.287 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So then, when the client
sits in front of me

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:84%
or if they're on the
phone-- and you know what?

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
It works the same on
the phone because if you

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:84%
came to my office in
Carefree, Georgie,

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.154 align:middle line:84%
you'd find out I never look at
you at all during a reading.

00:12:57.154 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I was
just in Scottsdale.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.432 align:middle line:84%
Had I known you were there,
I would have popped in.

00:13:01.432 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Well, I
never look at my client

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:84%
because I'm focused on the
pictures that I'm receiving.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And I try to set the
client's expectations

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:84%
that although I have control
over this environment being

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
very loving-- there's not going
to be any scary, bad evil stuff

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:84%
coming in-- I have no
control over who connects,

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.760 align:middle line:84%
how long they stay, or what
they want to talk about.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But you can be assured that your
best interests are at heart.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, if people also
want to ask questions

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.757 align:middle line:84%
around future potentials,
we can do that, as well.

00:13:31.757 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you do a quick
little reading with me

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:90%
now or how does that work?

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you spontaneously
do this or do

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:90%
you have to prepare for that?

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: I usually
do a preparation

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:84%
of grounding and
protection and I

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.311 align:middle line:90%
did do my prayers this morning.

00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm just trying to see--

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about my prayers?

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.397 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: I can see your aura.

00:13:52.397 --> 00:13:54.355 align:middle line:84%
Would you like me to tell
you what I see there?

00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, what do you see?

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Well,
first off, you have

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
sort of like a cone shape
over your crown chakra,

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:84%
which is directly above
your head, which tells me

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
that some of the time, you are
actually channeling directly

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.240 align:middle line:90%
from your spiritual team.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the right
words just pop in to you.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:84%
You also have a deep
connection with spirit

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and you have a deep connection
with a father figure

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:84%
who pretty much stands
with you all the time, very

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
close to your right
shoulder-- likes

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:90%
to pat you on the shoulder.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever felt like
you've been touched

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:90%
since your father passed?

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a matter of
record that your father passed

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:90%
but he touches you.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I feel presence, not a
physical touching but presence.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
You know how you sometimes
know somebody is staring at you

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and then, you turn around and
there they are staring at you?

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:54.809 align:middle line:90%
That kind of feeling sometimes.

00:14:54.809 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: And I feel
like one of the things

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
that you have in common with him
is a very strong solar plexus,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.260 align:middle line:90%
which is strong gut instincts.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Those gut instincts have
never led you wrong.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And you never have
to say goodbye.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.771 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to tell you you
never have to say goodbye.

00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessary
to say goodbye.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is interesting
because when he passed,

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I never had a chance
to say goodbye.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:90%
It happened relatively fast.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Oh!

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had gotten a
call from my sister who

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.344 align:middle line:84%
has passed at this point
herself and she said,

00:15:30.344 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:90%
dad's in the hospital.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:90%
He was in Detroit.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:90%
I was in St. Louis at the time.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said, dad's
in the hospital.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:39.670 align:middle line:90%
He's not doing well.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:90%
It was a real quick thing.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Apparently what had happened
was a couple weeks before that,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:90%
he had fell.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:52.130 align:middle line:84%
He fell or he stumbled but
apparently, he broke his neck.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't tell
anybody and he

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:90%
didn't act like he was in pain.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And one day, my mother
noticed this huge lump.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
His name was Gabriel and
she said, Gabe, what's

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:90%
that big lump on your neck?

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.594 align:middle line:84%
And he went, oh, nothing,
Georgette, nothing.

00:16:05.594 --> 00:16:06.135 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Oh!

00:16:06.135 --> 00:16:08.343 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she said, no,
we're going to the doctor.

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So my sister and
my mother and he

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:84%
rushed to the ER room and the
doctor was looking at him.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And while he was
there, he said, he

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:84%
has a broken neck
and the only way

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
we can fix this is we have to go
in through the back of his neck

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and come out through his
throat area and patch him up.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And my dad heard this
and said, no, you're

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.830 align:middle line:84%
not and closed
his eyes and died.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:90%
That's how fast he went.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So I never had that
chance to get out there

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and to be with them for
that moment or anything.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I was getting these
calls from my sister

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:90%
and he was gone, just like that.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:90%
So that's how fast it went.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: It happens
very commonly.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:10%
In fact, sometimes, people
are visiting their loved one

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:10%
in the hospital.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
They step out just for
a minute for a coffee--

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're gone.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Yeah because
sometimes, it's

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:84%
too hard for that loved
one to let go if you're

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:90%
standing there looking at them.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same for everybody
but he's telling you--

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he was 88.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: You never
have to say goodbye.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had a good run.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:13.605 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Yeah.

00:17:13.605 --> 00:17:14.105 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:17:14.105 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd be lucky to
have that kind of run.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Some time ago, a
friend of mine owns

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:84%
a house in the Hollywood area
called the Ackerman House.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And Mark Rawlings,
who's my buddy who

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the
president of our company,

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:84%
paranormaldate.com, sometimes
had some people come in

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.819 align:middle line:84%
because it's been reported
that Forrest Ackerman still

00:17:36.819 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:90%
hangs around there.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Ackerman was a sci-fi expert,
producer, Hollywood-type,

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:84%
but he was well-known in the
sci-fi genre at that time.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So a group of people,
including yourself,

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.550 align:middle line:84%
decided to spend several
days there and conduct

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.610 align:middle line:90%
seances and the like.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to take a
look, first of all,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:84%
at the Forrest
Ackerman situation.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Otherwise, and
then she shakes her head.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:05.925 align:middle line:90%
So he would.

00:18:05.925 --> 00:18:08.890 align:middle line:90%
He would have lived to 100.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:14.075 align:middle line:84%
He was tired of being
without her and he was tired.

00:18:14.075 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Does it fit--

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: He has so much energy.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>I have to ask these
things because I don't know.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>>Yeah, he decided to die.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.637 align:middle line:90%
He was in complete control.

00:18:21.637 --> 00:18:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Yes.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>That's why I'm asking.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: He's talking
about the last supper

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:90%
and he's knowing it's coming.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.785 align:middle line:84%
He's made a decision
and he's acting

00:18:33.785 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
like he's going to just turn
off the TV or something,

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.370 align:middle line:84%
pull the plug on the
TV type of thing.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
He's just deciding that's it
and it's going to be black.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.065 align:middle line:84%
He's showing me, maybe
I'll be in the stars.

00:18:48.065 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll float to the stars
and I'll cease to exist.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's not like that at all.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was interesting.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Give me your take
on that experience.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: I love the name
of the place, "Ackermansion"

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:90%
for Forrest J. Ackerman.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was great that Mark
invited us to the house.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:90%
There was a huge team.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Rosemary Ellen Guiley was there.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Gary Schwartz, who I've
worked with as a research

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.020 align:middle line:90%
medium, was there--

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.311 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Great guests on
"Coast to Coast" with us, too.

00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Jamie
Clark, psychic medium,

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and a team doing camera
work and EVP work.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's an 18-room house
so there's plenty of room.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a mansion.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:24.806 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: It is.

00:19:24.806 --> 00:19:26.950 align:middle line:90%
You could get lost in there.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
The minute you walk in, you
know something's different.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of spirit
activity going on everywhere.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not all Mr.
Ackerman and his family.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.840 align:middle line:84%
There's just-- Hollywood
is very haunted itself.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:84%
But I had a really
crazy experience where

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I was awakened three times.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:84%
There were no locks on
doors but someone came in,

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
opened the door, took a
couple steps in, and just

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.524 align:middle line:84%
looked at me as
I'm lying in bed.

00:19:56.524 --> 00:19:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You saw this?

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: I saw it.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:90%
I could not make out the person.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:84%
It was just a big,
large, dark figure

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:84%
but they were backlit because
the hallway light was on.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's unnerving.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.332 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: It is because
there's no lock on the door

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and I'm spending the
night in this house.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With people
you don't know.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:17.472 align:middle line:84%
So I sit up and go, hey and
they back out and slam the door.

00:20:17.472 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I happen to know
Rosemary walks around

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.260 align:middle line:90%
at night with an axe.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding, Rosemary, kidding.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Well, the second
time it happened, I thought,

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:90%
this is ridiculous.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Don't these camera crew
people talk to each other

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and know there's a
lady in this room?

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Third time, someone
came in, same big, dark,

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:84%
shadow figure-- had a laser
pointer and went like this

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.900 align:middle line:84%
all the way across the
bed, hit me in the face,

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:90%
and I'm yelling.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, they back
out, slam the door.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I got up, got dressed,
sat on the bed-- then

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:90%
I listened at the door.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I could hear
nothing, not a peep.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:90%
I was mad.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.877 align:middle line:90%
To me, this wasn't paranormal.

00:20:55.877 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were
violated, basically.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Yes, this is some
rude guy on a camera crew.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many
people were in the crew?

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.758 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: There
was 20-some people.

00:21:04.758 --> 00:21:06.092 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my gosh.

00:21:06.092 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: It was a big group.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.175 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Everybody was
staying in that house?

00:21:09.175 --> 00:21:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Yep and I
felt like maybe somebody

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:15.150 align:middle line:84%
didn't tell somebody that
there was a lady in the room.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So I got up, got dressed--
I emailed Gary Schwartz, who

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.690 align:middle line:84%
was staying at a hotel,
about 3:00 AM saying,

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:22.930 align:middle line:90%
this is unacceptable.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:84%
These people don't
expect privacy.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:84%
I need to be moved
to a hotel tomorrow.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Get up in the morning--
go downstairs.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:84%
There's Paul Davids and you
know Paul from "Roswell."

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And Paul says,
Susanne, I understand

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:90%
you've had quite an experience.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:84%
He had already--
before I'd gotten up,

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:90%
he'd gotten Gary's email.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:84%
He'd interviewed
everyone in the house.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:84%
No one would step
up and say that they

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:90%
were the one that came in.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nor would they.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: No.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.840 align:middle line:84%
No and so my reaction, well,
I think then somebody's lying.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:84%
No offense but somebody's
lying because this

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:58.730 align:middle line:90%
looked like a person.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not that easy to fool,
ghost, spirit, person.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.177 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One time, all right,
maybe a mistake, right?

00:22:04.177 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Yes.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Two times,
eh-- three times?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's searching around.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: I'm convinced
that it's a person.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: So what happened
then, Rosemary Ellen Guiley

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:84%
had to leave and go out
to contact in the desert.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:90%
So she took off.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:90%
We're still there.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:84%
She texts Paul Davids
and says, oh, gosh,

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I really need my laser pointer
for my presentation here.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not in my laptop
case where I keep that.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.570 align:middle line:84%
They turned that
house upside down

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and could not find
her laser pointer.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I just saw Rosemary
a couple weeks ago.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:84%
She said, weeks
later, even though she

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:84%
had searched that
laptop case, she

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
had turned every
pocket inside-out,

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.824 align:middle line:84%
her and her husband, that laser
pointer showed up recently.

00:22:46.824 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There it was.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Mm-hmm.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.390 align:middle line:90%
Was it an apport?

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know but it
sure is interesting.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That is
an interesting tic.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.734 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: I had my
name called out.

00:22:55.734 --> 00:22:56.900 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of things going.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.660 align:middle line:90%
We had a wonderful seance.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So your conclusion--
your total conclusion was what?

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: The
Ackermansion is haunted.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
The Ackermansion has a lot
of loving, excited energy

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:84%
because the whole house was
filled with sci-fi memorabilia.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.315 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Ackerman used to
have people come in and--

00:23:13.315 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had parties
there and everything.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Yes, it's amazing.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you're convinced
he's the one haunting?

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: No, I think
he comes and visits

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.240 align:middle line:90%
because he loves the place.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I really think it's the
area there in Hollywood

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:84%
because as a medium,
I can look out

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.170 align:middle line:84%
the window of the
Ackermansion and I can

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:90%
see spirits walking everywhere.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.766 align:middle line:84%
You go down to
downtown Hollywood,

00:23:35.766 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:84%
there's spirits walking
right through people.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.098 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
everywhere, right?

00:23:39.098 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:84%
If a spirit gets reincarnated
and comes back in human form,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle line:84%
does that mean it's gone
from the spirit realm?

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't hap--
it doesn't haunt.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't come back?

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Once it reincarnates,
is it gone?

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: You know, George,
this is one of those things

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know and I'm
still gathering information.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I have been told a couple
different theories.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.220 align:middle line:84%
The soul divides, like
there's 50 George Noorys

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.710 align:middle line:84%
out there living in
different dimensions,

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.240 align:middle line:84%
living different
lives in one soul.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it still
could be there.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Right.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, I've been
told by spirits, oh,

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.390 align:middle line:84%
but I'm coming
through for my wife.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Tell my wife, don't worry.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:23.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to wait 100 years
before I reincarnate so

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.680 align:middle line:90%
that we can be together again.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really
sure how it works.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I just know that
the soul's eternal

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and we seem to shift
between dimensions.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And as you know,
this program is interactive

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and we take some
phone calls here.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.319 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to our first
caller for Susanne.

00:24:39.319 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hey, Susanne.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:84%
My name is Mike
from Studio City.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I was just wondering if
everyone has the potential

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:90%
to be a psychic.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So what do you think?

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Mike, thank
you for the question.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I do believe that everybody
has potential to be psychic.

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The psychic abilities
are built into the body.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just like if
you bought a car

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and it had a really awesome GPS
system but you never used it.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:90%
You're wasting a resource.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:84%
It had XM radio but you
never turned on the music.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:90%
You're wasting a resource.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
The ability to see, hear,
and feel information,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:84%
to have gut instincts,
to just know,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:90%
it is built into the body.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the mediumship
is different.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:84%
The mediumship is connecting
with "discarnates" or those

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.730 align:middle line:90%
who are not in bodies anymore.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe that everyone
has the ability for mediumship.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: I believe that
everyone has the ability

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:41.650 align:middle line:84%
to recognize and receive
messages from their own loved

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.060 align:middle line:84%
ones in the light and the loved
ones in the light work at it.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.430 align:middle line:90%
They practice it.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think everybody
has a built-in ability

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:84%
to receive messages and
do readings for others.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I think mediums
are born, not made.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're not all
James Van Praaghs, are we?

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: No.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.801 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, let's
go to our next caller.

00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi, Susanne.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:84%
My name is Dennis and I
wanted to know how I find out

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.866 align:middle line:90%
who my spirit guides are.

00:26:05.866 --> 00:26:09.276 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, now that's
an interesting question.

00:26:09.276 --> 00:26:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Dennis, thank
you for the question.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a spiritual
team of guides, angels,

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and loved ones in the
light and a spiritual team

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.700 align:middle line:90%
is a gift from the creator.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And we need all the
resources that we

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:84%
can get because Earth is
said to be the toughest

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:90%
classroom in the galaxy.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.620 align:middle line:84%
To find out who your
guides are, make sure

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.030 align:middle line:84%
that you're in a very
calm and relaxed state

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and work on your
grounding and protection.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Some people will use
a grounding bubble

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.930 align:middle line:84%
or say a prayer, like
the Lord's Prayer.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And just know that you're
in a positive state.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have to focus on
your breath, your breathing,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:90%
and just be open.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Create a place that
you can see, hear,

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and feel in your mind's eye
and make it very, very real

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
because remember, spirit guides
don't have physical places,

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:90%
physical bodies.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you create
that meeting place,

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.020 align:middle line:84%
you're actually speaking
what I call the "love

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:90%
language of the afterlife."

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Some people choose a
park bench in a park

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and they go and
they sit and say,

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to meet my guides.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Trust any and all
information that you receive,

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:28.590 align:middle line:84%
as long as it feels
loving and it feels good.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And make sure that you
journal directly afterwards

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.021 align:middle line:84%
because the more
that you do this,

00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:36.270 align:middle line:84%
the more that you'll start
to pick up the information.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see
patterns and trends

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:90%
in how you're receiving it.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are your guides
also your guardian angels?

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: There is
one guardian angel

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and one guide that is with each
individual from birth to death.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Other angels and other
guides will come and go

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:84%
for a season or a reason,
depending on what you're

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:90%
going through in your life.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And even loved ones,
pets-- animals can

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:84%
be guides because
your dog, your cat,

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:12.500 align:middle line:84%
your horse can come in and give
you peace of mind and healing.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go to our
final caller here for Susanne.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name is David.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:90%
I live in New York City.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I was curious if you ever
put yourself in danger

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.260 align:middle line:90%
because of the work you do.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would guess
you do put yourself

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.771 align:middle line:90%
in danger all the time.

00:28:28.771 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Yeah, David,
that's a good question.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:35.380 align:middle line:84%
No matter how hard I work on
my grounding and protection,

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.490 align:middle line:84%
the brighter your
light, the brighter

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.370 align:middle line:84%
your aura gets--
and doing this work

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:42.100 align:middle line:84%
gives you a very
big, bright aura--

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:46.870 align:middle line:84%
the more that you can attract
good, bad, or indifferent.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I have gone out and done
haunted house investigations

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:84%
where I just walk in
and I'm the medium.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.310 align:middle line:90%
What do I pick up?

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And I actually did
have a spirit follow

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.666 align:middle line:84%
me home-- got in the car
with me, came in the house.

00:29:01.666 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Whoa.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: It was
very, very scary.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
learned that I really

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.980 align:middle line:84%
have to be very choosy about
what I do and where I go.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, that example I gave
earlier at the Ackermansion's

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.840 align:middle line:90%
a really good example.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Normally, each night,
I ask my guardian

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.400 align:middle line:84%
angel-- her name's Mary
Ella-- I ask her, stand

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:84%
at the doorway in the bedroom
and don't let anybody in

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.080 align:middle line:90%
to disturb me.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.190 align:middle line:84%
When I was on this
project, I just

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.070 align:middle line:84%
said, Mary Ella, don't
let anybody hurt me

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.390 align:middle line:90%
but I can accept a visit.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susanne, I think
right now on this planet,

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.736 align:middle line:90%
we're at a very tense time.

00:29:41.736 --> 00:29:45.630 align:middle line:84%
There seem to be conflicts
all over the planet.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be getting bigger.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Does the spirit world
ever communicate to you

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
that it's concerned about
the activities of humans,

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that we're killing each
other, that something's going

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.757 align:middle line:90%
to happen if this keeps up?

00:30:01.757 --> 00:30:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Yes.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Recently, I was shown a vision
of two possible outcomes

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:10.540 align:middle line:90%
for the Earth within 200 years.

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:15.820 align:middle line:84%
One is 200 years from now,
wars have been fought.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Women can no longer be fertile.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.099 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that's born has to
be born through a test tube.

00:30:23.099 --> 00:30:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.056 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: There's
nothing growing.

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:28.691 align:middle line:84%
Food has to be manufactured
and it was a very desolate--

00:30:28.691 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's a
horrible scenario.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Oh, bleak, very bleak.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, the other
scenario is heaven on earth,

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:41.010 align:middle line:84%
that plants, food,
everything flows and grows,

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.120 align:middle line:90%
that we have peace and harmony.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And the difference in
those two scenarios

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:84%
are the choices that each
of us make as individuals.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.390 align:middle line:84%
It starts with just one
and we're all connected.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But we create our future
through our thoughts, words,

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.700 align:middle line:90%
and actions.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And this scenario was
actually shown to me

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:84%
through a spirit guide
for a client who ended up

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:84%
writing a book called
"Liberating Jesus," Roberta

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.019 align:middle line:84%
Grimes, who you've
had on the show.

00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Now personally,
even though I'm not

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:84%
going to be here in
200 years-- none of us

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:20.450 align:middle line:84%
are-- we'd like to
see this planet go on.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
that we can do that

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:84%
is if we become obedient to
the creator's law of love.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And by "love," I don't
mean, oh, I've got

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.340 align:middle line:90%
to go around and hug everybody.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.180 align:middle line:90%
I've got to feel love.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Love is not a feeling
in this context.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:41.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a behavior of
respect and compassion.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And it starts with ourselves,
treating ourselves well,

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:47.370 align:middle line:84%
accepting who we are and
treating others well.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I think there's
a really good chance in 200

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.900 align:middle line:84%
years, the planet's going to be
a place that's uninhabitable.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.385 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be heaven on Earth.

00:31:55.385 --> 00:31:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It could be.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's hope it's that.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.770 align:middle line:84%
You and I had an opportunity
to go to a seance

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:03.810 align:middle line:84%
not too long ago in
Scottsdale, Arizona.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And the jury's still
out over that seance.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:11.730 align:middle line:84%
That was really my first
seance that I've attended.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was very well done,
in terms of what had happened

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and the ingredients
that were in it,

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.710 align:middle line:84%
spirits coming, talking,
touching you, feeling it.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:84%
In total blackness and darkness,
we couldn't see a thing.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.610 align:middle line:84%
However, I'm still
not sure personally

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.370 align:middle line:90%
about its authenticity.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.880 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I would like to have
a little more evidence

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.980 align:middle line:84%
before I come forward and say,
hey, this, I think, was real.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.920 align:middle line:84%
This really happened or it
didn't or it was all trickery.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure because there
were some episodes there

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that were a little confusing
for me-- holding hands, which

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.099 align:middle line:84%
meant that if somebody
broke holding hands,

00:32:58.099 --> 00:32:59.640 align:middle line:84%
they were out
wandering around trying

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to find out who are these
spirits and what's in there.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Is there some guy in a
black outfit in front of you

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:10.460 align:middle line:84%
in the darkness touching you on
the head and things like that?

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.890 align:middle line:84%
We weren't allowed to
bring in any metal objects,

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.402 align:middle line:84%
mini flashlights,
nothing like that.

00:33:16.402 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And I would have liked
to have done that.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Even if I would have
disrupted the seance,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I would've liked to have at
least turn the flashlight on

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and see if there's
anybody in that room.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Well, they say
that a light disturbance

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.640 align:middle line:90%
could affect the ectoplasm.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.727 align:middle line:84%
The ectoplasm would snap
back into the physical medium

00:33:34.727 --> 00:33:35.435 align:middle line:90%
and potentially--

00:33:35.435 --> 00:33:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And it would hurt him.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.361 align:middle line:90%
>>WILSON: Right, exactly.

00:33:37.361 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But even though I've been
a medium my whole life,

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I've never experienced
physical mediumship myself.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So this was the first time and
I had no idea what to expect.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.221 align:middle line:84%
And we were sitting side
by side so you know that--

00:33:53.221 --> 00:33:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think that was you.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:56.740 align:middle line:90%
I was in total darkness.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Yeah,
exactly, total darkness,

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.676 align:middle line:84%
total sensory deprivation
except for hearing.

00:34:02.676 --> 00:34:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could not see your
fingers in front of your hands.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:90%
It was that dark.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: That was a little
scary in and of itself.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But they played
beautiful music so it

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.860 align:middle line:90%
felt uplifting and emotional.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.780 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather came through
with a phrase that really meant

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.739 align:middle line:84%
a lot to me that I had heard
him say thousands of times

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:90%
and it really shook me.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And as a mental medium, what
I did was a few days later,

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I put out the call to him,
granddad, if you're around,

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:34.949 align:middle line:90%
I really want to connect.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:37.909 align:middle line:84%
We have a certain meeting
place that I've constructed

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:38.750 align:middle line:90%
on the mental plane.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.780 align:middle line:84%
We met there and he
said, yes, I was there.

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And he also said there
were many spirits there.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:84%
They were preparing ahead
of time, just like they do,

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.679 align:middle line:90%
to come through.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is the one thing
I'm sure of that was real.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:35:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I think the American audience
needs more information.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.070 align:middle line:90%
We need more evidence

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We sure do.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WILSON: Because they've been
doing these physical mediumship

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.180 align:middle line:84%
seances for many, many years
in England and apparently

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.800 align:middle line:90%
in Australia, too.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're used to all of
the singing and the voices

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.160 align:middle line:90%
and everything that goes on.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:20.020 align:middle line:84%
But some of it was unsettling
and interesting and some of it

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.331 align:middle line:90%
was very touching.

00:35:21.331 --> 00:35:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susanne, if people
want to get a hold of you,

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.580 align:middle line:90%
how do they find you?
