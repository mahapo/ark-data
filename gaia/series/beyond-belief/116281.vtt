with the advent

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%

So I started hearing these
accounts and thought,

00:04:16.676 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:90%
this is pretty interesting.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a strange twist.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:90%
It could be an urban legend.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It could be that there's
something more to it.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:10%
But then I started
meeting people

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:10%
who told me they had
encountered these things.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And sitting down
and interviewing

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:84%

encounter with these kids,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.965 align:middle line:84%

So let's go back
just a little bit.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Someone made it up.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the most famous account
appeared in '97 from a Texas

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%
journalist named Brian Bethel.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Had a personal encounter
with these things.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Posted it on the internet.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:84%
The term "black eyed kid"
shows up during those accounts,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.250 align:middle line:90%
and that's what stuck.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So I found that when I started
probing into these things

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that you had to
discard that term

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and start looking for
the same parameters

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:90%
around these accounts.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.079 align:middle line:84%
And that's when old
cases started showing up.

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:90%
And they're still-- constantly.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.230 align:middle line:90%
There are more and more cases.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how far back
have you been able to go?

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.408 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Well, I had a
really fascinating account

00:07:25.408 --> 00:07:27.155 align:middle line:90%
from the 1950s, early 1950s.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us the story.

00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Really
strange encounter.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Young man, rural area,
very simple people.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:90%
This young man is walking home.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And he's literally walking
down the dirt lane that

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:84%
leads to his house and
he sees this young boy

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:90%
leaning against a fence post.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, he doesn't know this boy.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:84%
He knows everyone
in the community.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.047 align:middle line:84%
And he stops and
starts talking to him.

00:07:53.047 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Little kid, then.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Yeah.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.046 align:middle line:90%
He was eight, 10 years old.

00:07:56.046 --> 00:07:57.045 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere in that range.

00:07:57.045 --> 00:07:57.795 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, yeah.

00:07:57.795 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: So
this young man stops

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and starts talking
to this kid and says,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:84%
hey, what are you
doing out here?

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And things like that.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Just normal country terms.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: This kid who's
kind of leaning with his head

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:84%
down like this against
the post suddenly

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
looks up at this young man,
solid black eyes, and says,

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:90%
I want to go to your house.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:90%
You take me up to your house.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Uh.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.555 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: This
gentleman just--

00:08:29.555 --> 00:08:30.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Freaked.

00:08:30.263 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Yeah.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:90%
He felt a chill.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:90%
He immediately feels terrified.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And he's thinking-- he's only
thinking-- how fast can I

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:90%
run up the lane and get home?

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: As if this black
eyed child has read his mind,

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:51.172 align:middle line:84%
he immediately responds, says,
don't you run away from me.

00:08:51.172 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take
me up to your house.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's freaky.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: So this
gentleman, by all accounts,

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
broke every speed
record he'd ever made,

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:90%
making it to his door.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Isn't it
interesting how adults

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.269 align:middle line:90%
fear a little eight-year-old.

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:90%

>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:09:07.611 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But there's much
more going on here.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
This particular
case, this gentleman,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:90%
he burst into his home.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:90%
His mother and father are there.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.577 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
you know, why are you

00:09:18.577 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:90%
tearing in here like that?

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:90%
He blurts out the story.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Their immediate response-- oh,
I should add one more thing.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:84%
As he's running away
from this child,

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
he hears what he describes as
the scream of a bobcat coming

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:84%
from this child behind him,
which of course compels

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.693 align:middle line:90%
him to run all the faster.

00:09:38.693 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: So his
parents hear this story.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And bear in mind, the
term "black eyed child"

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:84%
is never used. "Black
eyed kid" is never used.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Their immediate response
is, you've met the devil.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
We're taking you
down to the preacher.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So you know, here we have
the cultural lens of the time

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
period and the people
identifying this

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:90%
as best as they can.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:90%
So their interpretation is--

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --the devil.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --this
is the devil.

>>NOORY: Evil.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.756 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: You've met the
devil at the crossroads,

00:10:10.756 --> 00:10:11.557 align:middle line:90%
or on the road.

00:10:11.557 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In the shape
of a little boy.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.598 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: In
the shape of a boy.

00:10:14.598 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And the idea, which shows
up a lot in demonology,

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:84%
that anything demonic can't
fully take human form.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Something has to be
distorted, whether it's

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.095 align:middle line:84%
a hand or a foot,
maybe the eyes.

00:10:26.095 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or the eyes.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Or the eyes.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So David, exactly what
are black eyed children?

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: You know, George,
despite all the investigation

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and other people aside from
me investigating these things,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.579 align:middle line:84%
the jury is sort of out
on exactly what they are.

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Now, we can look
at a lot of identifying traits

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:90%
in these encounters.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
First of all, of course,
the solid black eyes.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.060 align:middle line:90%
No whites, no pupils, nothing.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is weird.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.107 align:middle line:90%
Biologically weird.

00:10:53.107 --> 00:10:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: It is
biologically weird.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.731 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know,
physicians will tell you

00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
that if someone had
a solid black eye,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:84%
that they would be
blind essentially.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.092 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Might represent
some kind of head trauma

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are other
traits that show up, too.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Most people say that these
kids have pale or pasty skin.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Some people say it
looks artificial.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.024 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a covering?

00:11:15.024 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Possibly.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.866 align:middle line:84%
Sort of hearkens back
to men in black cases.

00:11:17.866 --> 00:11:19.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of people
describe them as having--

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Pasty.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.815 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --skin that
doesn't look natural.

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.658 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: And you hear
that a lot with these kids.

00:11:24.658 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The age range usually falls
somewhere between eight and 12

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
years old is what the
most common accounts say.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:84%
You see a little
bit outside of that.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Even now, there are
some black eyed adults

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:90%
that have started showing up.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But other traits are a very
monotone way of speaking.

Unusual request.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, they'll show
up at a stranger's door

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say,
oh, we just thought

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:90%
we'd come in for a while.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.405 align:middle line:90%

making a sandwich

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: And why
won't they stop knocking?

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Go to the door, open it.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere from one to three
kids, eight, 10, 12 years old,

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.540 align:middle line:90%
standing outside your door.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Looking up at you.

00:12:40.665 --> 00:12:43.432 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Well, almost always
they're standing like this.

00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Head sort of looking
down at their shoes.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.579 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, they
hide their eyes.

00:12:46.579 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:90%
Initially.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.401 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Virtually
everyone I've

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.960 align:middle line:84%
interviewed, they go
through about three stages

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:90%
with these encounters.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.394 align:middle line:84%
They open the door
and first see the kids

00:12:59.394 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and they just have this
feeling that something's not

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.250 align:middle line:90%
quite right.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.878 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Now, they've never
seen these children before.

00:13:04.878 --> 00:13:07.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, these
happen in neighborhoods

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:84%
where the people know everyone
who lives in their community.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's a slight
unease that starts

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:84%
to increase dramatically when
these children start talking.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Because these monotone
phrases start coming out

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:90%
and they're weird.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Hey, it might rain.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.849 align:middle line:90%
You need to let us in for a bit.

00:13:30.849 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out of nowhere, right?

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.931 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:13:32.931 --> 00:13:35.374 align:middle line:90%
So the unease--

00:13:35.374 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're hungry.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.081 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:13:37.081 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
The unease grows very quickly
to outright nervousness.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have people ever
just slammed the door?

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:44.975 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Well, they do.

00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Because during these
encounters, inevitably

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
what happens is the people
try to interact with them

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.591 align:middle line:84%
and say things like,
I don't know you guys.

00:13:51.591 --> 00:13:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Or I think you have
the wrong house.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:84%
At some point, these children
will raise their heads

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:90%
and make eye contact.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the level of fear

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:90%
really spikes in the victim.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
when it's creepy.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: And it's just
like, this is too much.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And they slam the
door on these kids.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.686 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, when you open
the door, are they gone?

00:14:08.686 --> 00:14:10.381 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Gone.

00:14:10.381 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: They vanish.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you reject
them, they disappear.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: There is an account
in the book from a police

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:84%
officer who encountered a
pair of these kids, a boy

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and a girl, standing
on the deck of a house

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the morning.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.684 align:middle line:90%
It was like 3:30 in the morning.

00:14:26.684 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Called by somebody?

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.975 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: He was called.

00:14:28.975 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the
house next door, he

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:84%
was called on a
domestic disturbance.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:90%
He went in.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:90%
He settled the issue.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.870 align:middle line:90%
No arrest made.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:84%
He's out in his patrol car,
happens to be just looking

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.572 align:middle line:90%
around the neighborhood as--

00:14:42.572 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A good cop would do.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY:
--officers would do.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:84%
He sees the house next
door, which has a deck.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:84%
He sees these two young
kids standing on this deck.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's thinking, why
are these kids out here

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.510 align:middle line:90%
at this time of the morning?

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: So he approaches
them, and they're acting

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:90%
very strange, of course.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:84%
He goes up the deck, which
has one flight of steps.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Heads are down, right?

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: He gets a
good look at these kids.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And his first thought is that
this is an abuse situation.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Oh, these kids have been
forced out of the house.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Or there's some kind of--

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's wrong.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --maybe
drug abuse going on,

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.472 align:middle line:84%
because they look
very strange to him.

00:15:20.472 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Their eyes have
dilated, that kind of thing.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.138 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: So
all of these things

00:15:24.138 --> 00:15:25.380 align:middle line:90%
are running through his head.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And he starts asking
the normal questions.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Why are you out
here, and so forth.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.372 align:middle line:90%
They won't let us in.

00:15:33.372 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
what the kids said?

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They won't let us in.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.654 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: So police officer,
of course, opens the door.

00:15:39.654 --> 00:15:40.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Knocks on the door.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Knocks
very loudly on the door.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Wants to know why
the parents won't let them in.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.385 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Announces
law enforcement.

00:15:45.385 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Takes a few knocks.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
But during this
exchange, he turns around

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.747 align:middle line:84%
and these kids have
vanished, George.

00:15:53.747 --> 00:15:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Now, he's up
on a deck with a railing.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:84%
They would have to
climb the railing

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.309 align:middle line:84%
and leap over into
the yard, because--

00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
would have seen that.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.183 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --he's essentially
blocking the steps where

00:16:05.183 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:90%
he's standing at the door.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:90%
He would have seen it.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.790 align:middle line:90%
He would have heard it.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.498 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's like
they dematerialize.

00:16:09.498 --> 00:16:11.007 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: They have vanished.

00:16:11.007 --> 00:16:13.215 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when the person
finally comes to the door,

00:16:13.215 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
it's an older woman
who has no children,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
has no idea what
he's talking about.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.690 align:middle line:90%
No one's come to her door.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:90%
It's just a bizarre encounter.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He turns to look at
the kids and they're gone.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.946 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Oh, and this has
unnerved this man for years.

00:16:24.946 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, he's searched,
of course, the yard.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.070 align:middle line:90%
And no trees.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Nothing for them to hide behind.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.679 align:middle line:90%
He searches the neighborhood.

00:16:32.679 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.053 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: And last
time I spoke with him,

00:16:35.053 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
he told me that he still goes
back there on occasion just

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:37.960 align:middle line:90%
to see--

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.721 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Creepy.

00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --if there's any
kids in that neighborhood that

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.107 align:middle line:84%
match that description because
it was so unsettling to him.

00:16:45.107 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about the
disappearances of them.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.605 align:middle line:84%
So they seem to appear
and disappear at will.

00:16:51.605 --> 00:16:52.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: It
appears that way.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like they go
through some kind of portal

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.065 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so sudden.

00:17:00.065 --> 00:17:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you have someone
who's a trained observer,

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
like a law enforcement officer,
who his very life depends

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.180 align:middle line:90%
on him paying attention, right?

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Listening to all the
sounds and watching things.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And long enough for him to
turn around, knock on a door,

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and turn back, and these
kids have vanished?

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
There's something very unnatural
going on here, obviously.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The request.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:84%
The goal and the mission of
these black eyed children

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:90%
is to get in the house.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: That's what it
appears from the request.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:84%
They want to be invited
inside, whether it's inside

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.305 align:middle line:90%
a home, a business, a vehicle.

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They can't come in
on their own, it sounds like.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.596 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: It doesn't
appear that way, which

00:17:40.596 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
is curious because again, here
we have another connection

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:84%
to a different type of
paranormal or supernatural

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.460 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Because traditional vampire
lore, of all things,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:84%
says that a vampire can't
come in unless it's invited.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It must
be invited, yeah.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.503 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: But what
a lot of people forget

00:17:58.503 --> 00:18:00.420 align:middle line:84%
is that the same
is true for demons.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.950 align:middle line:84%
In classical demonology,
a demon can't

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:84%
enter-- whether it's a
home or a person's body--

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.641 align:middle line:84%
unless some type of
invitation has been issued.

00:18:09.641 --> 00:18:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: The opening
has been created.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if you
don't let them in,

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.820 align:middle line:90%
they seem to disappear.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: They do.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
But you know, George, after
listening to so many people,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:24.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that a big part
of these encounters

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.146 align:middle line:84%
is that level of
fear that's created.

00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: And
you get the sense

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.490 align:middle line:84%
when you listen to these
accounts over and over again

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:84%
that these things appear just
to create this incredible level

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:90%
of fear in people.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's as if, OK, we're done.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.975 align:middle line:84%
I think they're feeding
on it because it's energy.

00:18:43.975 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Fear is energy.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody ever
reportedly let them in?

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Oh, boy.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, I get a lot
of reports even now

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.719 align:middle line:90%
of people who claim to have--

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Seen them.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.593 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --had them
in the house and so forth.

00:18:58.593 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
so many of them

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
are very difficult
to follow up on.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were a handful
that I had that I investigated

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.740 align:middle line:90%
when I was writing the book.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And one that was just
absolutely incredible.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I was able to interview
the entire family.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
disturbing account.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And that story's
a little bit long,

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.430 align:middle line:84%
but I'm happy to
share it with you--

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, please.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.213 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --if
you want to hear it.

00:19:22.213 --> 00:19:23.814 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:19:23.814 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:10%
>>WEATHERLY: This
is a young woman

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:10%
who has a child of her own.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:10%
She's driving home from work.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's a rural area.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
She pulls into a convenience
store in her vehicle

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and she leaves her child in the
back seat, jumps out to run in

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:90%
and grab a loaf of bread.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not a good thing to do.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Not a
good thing to do.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Don't leave
your kid alone.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: But bear in mind,
this is small town America.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And you know, everyone
knows everyone.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is a pattern that this
woman has done countless times.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
She won't do it
anymore, I can tell you.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So she runs into the convenience
store, grabs her milk or bread

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.295 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:19:59.295 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:90%
She comes back out.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:02.677 align:middle line:90%
Autopilot.

00:20:02.677 --> 00:20:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you know
how this is, George.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Jumping in the vehicle,
tossing the bag in the seat,

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.110 align:middle line:84%
turning the key, looking
in the view mirror.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.380 align:middle line:90%
And there it is.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.970 align:middle line:84%
This kid with solid black eyes
looking at her in the rear view

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:15.240 align:middle line:90%
mirror.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Next to the baby?

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.818 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Sitting
right beside her child.

00:20:17.818 --> 00:20:18.318 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh.

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.129 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: So this--

00:20:23.129 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's the baby doing?

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.794 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Oh,
it's not a baby.

00:20:25.794 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a young boy.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.891 align:middle line:84%
As memory serves me, he's
around 10 years old himself.

00:20:29.891 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.840 align:middle line:84%
He's not panicking or
screaming or anything.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: No.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Acting completely normal.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: But sitting
right beside him.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And obviously three people
can sit in the back seat.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:84%
This black eyed child
is right beside this boy

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.970 align:middle line:84%
making physical
contact with him,

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:84%
now staring in the
rear view mirror.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.292 align:middle line:84%
Instant panic on
the mother's part.

00:20:47.292 --> 00:20:48.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:20:48.125 --> 00:20:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: She leaps
out of the vehicle.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:84%
She yanks open the back door,
pulls her son out, rushes back

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:90%
into the convenience store.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:84%
The clerk, of course, is
around the counter saying,

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:90%
what's happened?

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:84%
She's just sort of
stuttering and stammering.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:90%
She can't even--

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's in shock.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.996 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: --explain this.

00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:84%
She basically says, there's
somebody in my vehicle.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.416 align:middle line:90%
Clerk runs out.

00:21:12.416 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:90%
There's the vehicle--

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Empty.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.386 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --engine
running, doors open, empty.

00:21:16.386 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Nothing.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, this mother won't explain
what she has seen to the clerk.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:84%
She calls her
husband because she's

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:84%
afraid to get back
in the vehicle.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
She says, I just need you
to come here to the store.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Won't explain to him
what's going on, either.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Husband gets there.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:90%
She still won't explain it.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:43.154 align:middle line:84%
She says will you drive--
let me drive your truck home.

00:21:43.154 --> 00:21:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Freaky.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: I can't get
back in that vehicle.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.010 align:middle line:90%
He's like, OK.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:84%
We need to talk about this
at home, but all right.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.210 align:middle line:84%
She takes her husband's vehicle
with her son, goes home.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Husband takes the vehicle that
the black eyed child was in,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.284 align:middle line:90%
heads home.

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:00.200 align:middle line:90%
It's only a few miles.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: He's in a
wreck, totals the vehicle.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Blacks out.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:84%
The last thing he
remembered in the hospital

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.589 align:middle line:84%
was a foul odor overwhelming
him in the vehicle.

00:22:11.589 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the kid was
still in there somehow.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So the other
portion of this case

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.480 align:middle line:84%
is that the husband
fortunately was OK.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:84%
He had some minor bumps and
bruises, mild concussion,

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But they released him
from the hospital.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:84%
The mother meanwhile
is trying to determine

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.910 align:middle line:90%
exactly what happened.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:33.110 align:middle line:90%
So she's asking her son.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:90%
She says, who was that boy?

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you know him from school?

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't know him, Mommy.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:84%
He just asked if he
could get in our car.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I thought we could go
to my house and play.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:90%
So he let him in.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: He let him in.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
He invited him in because
he thought oh, here's

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.700 align:middle line:90%
a potential playmate.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But you know, George,
like most young kids,

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.536 align:middle line:84%
they don't see race,
religion, or anything else.

00:22:57.536 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, they
don't see that.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.493 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: So a
physical difference,

00:23:00.493 --> 00:23:03.737 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times for kids
that age, it's, OK.

00:23:03.737 --> 00:23:05.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, he looks
a little different.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:90%
But maybe this is a friend.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:84%
But the disturbing
side to this account

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:15.637 align:middle line:84%
is that this young boy, this
10-year-old, he became ill.

00:23:15.637 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Parents
took him to the hospital.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And so he's got these
symptoms, check him out.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:90%
This case stretched on and on.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.120 align:middle line:84%
The doctors could not figure out
what was wrong with this child.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.374 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was he dying?

00:23:31.374 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: No.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.680 align:middle line:84%
The reason they couldn't
figure out what was wrong

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.250 align:middle line:84%
is because every time they
thought they had him diagnosed,

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.067 align:middle line:90%
the symptoms changed.

00:23:38.067 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.858 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: So he broke out.

00:23:39.858 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, well
he has the measles.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.587 align:middle line:84%
So they start to prepare
to treat the measles.

00:23:45.587 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Then he's
got something else.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Something
else happens.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.790 align:middle line:90%
They thought he had measles.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
They thought he
had appendicitis.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:90%
They thought he had a flu.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Every time, it would
be something different.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:84%
He would spike a high
fever, and then it

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:84%
would go away like that before
they could even treat it.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the parents--
who, of course,

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.942 align:middle line:90%
did not tell the doctors--

00:24:04.942 --> 00:24:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About the kid.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.376 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --we've
seen a black eyed kid.

00:24:07.376 --> 00:24:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: They
decide well, we're

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.446 align:middle line:90%
just going to take him home.

00:24:10.446 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's just the flu.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.610 align:middle line:90%
And nurse him back to health.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Parents took the child home.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, started
calling in other friends

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.320 align:middle line:84%
that they could trust
and essentially started

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:84%
a prayer circle
around this boy that

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:90%
lasted for quite some time.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.469 align:middle line:90%
He fully recovered.

00:24:27.469 --> 00:24:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.797 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: And you know,
he's healthy and happy

00:24:30.797 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David,
what is your take

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:90%
of these black eyed children?

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:90%
What do you think they want?

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.410 align:middle line:84%
The effort of trying
to get into your house,

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:90%
to trying to be there.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.755 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:24:42.755 --> 00:24:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Are they after our souls?

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: You know,
George, after countless cases

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
interviewing so many people--
and when I wrote the book,

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:90%
I was very objective about it.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.905 align:middle line:90%
I said, it could be this.

00:24:55.905 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:90%
It could be this.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could be that, right.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: They have things
in common with alien hybrids,

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.570 align:middle line:90%
with demons, with men in black.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:90%
A wide range of phenomena.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:84%
My personal opinion, however,
is that these things are

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:90%
something inter-dimensional.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I think they're simply
coming through from--

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They come and go.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --another
level of existence,

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.297 align:middle line:84%
which science is now admitting
that there are other realities.

00:25:21.297 --> 00:25:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they in human
form on the other side?

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: I don't know.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or do they
take these shapes?

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: I don't
think they are.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I think they take
a childlike form

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:31.965 align:middle line:84%
because what better way to
catch someone off guard?

00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: We're hard wired
as adults that if a kid shows up

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.992 align:middle line:90%
and says, I need help--

00:25:36.992 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
going to help them.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --your
natural reaction, yeah.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're
going to help them.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.501 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Even if it's a
kid showing up at your door

00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and saying, I really need
a drink of water, mister.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.499 align:middle line:84%
Your natural
inclination is to help.

00:25:48.499 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And let them in.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: So
you're off guard.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So I think that whatever
these entities are,

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.950 align:middle line:84%
they're taking the
form of a child

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:84%
in order to catch
people off guard

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.092 align:middle line:84%
and create that level of
fear in people so they

00:26:03.092 --> 00:26:04.050 align:middle line:90%
can feed on the energy.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:05.841 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why haven't
they gone the distance

00:26:05.841 --> 00:26:09.132 align:middle line:90%
and corrected the eyes?

00:26:09.132 --> 00:26:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: You know--

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.506 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you're going to
take the shape of a little kid

00:26:12.506 --> 00:26:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and you have that, why
still stay with black eyes?

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.060 align:middle line:84%
There's something
weird about that.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.018 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: There is
something weird about it.

00:26:20.018 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
questions about this mystery

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.470 align:middle line:90%
that we kind of don't know.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that I'm
starting to see evidence

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.970 align:middle line:84%
for whatever these entities
are existing much further

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:90%
back in history.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And I say that because
one, so many accounts

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
keep showing up from the
'70s, the '50s, the '40s,

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:84%
of encounters with these
beings that essentially

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.900 align:middle line:90%
fit the same paradigm.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got other
unsettling things.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Urfa Man.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
this thing, George?

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Urfa Man is a
statue found at Gobekli Tepe.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:58.290 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhere in the
neighborhood of 13,000 years

00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's a statue of what they
think is a male figure that

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.580 align:middle line:90%
was carved that long ago.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Whoever did it took
the time to carve eyes

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.333 align:middle line:90%
out of black obsidian.

00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.549 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: So here you
have this weird statue--

00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With black eyes.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.548 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --13 and a
half thousand years old

00:27:21.548 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:90%
with solid black eyes.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to a lot of
people, archaeologists

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:90%
like Robert Shaw.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Linda
Moulton Howe, she and I

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:30.790 align:middle line:84%
had a long discussion
about this.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And everyone who's been in
the presence of this statue

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:37.170 align:middle line:84%
says that there is a very
unsettling feeling about it.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, why did someone
13 and a half

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.364 align:middle line:84%
thousand years ago choose
to depict an entity

00:27:41.364 --> 00:27:42.280 align:middle line:90%
with solid black eyes?

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With solid black eyes.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.701 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: That's a
really strange thing.

00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Unless he
witnessed these.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Or
something akin to it.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something happened.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Yeah.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.752 align:middle line:84%
So you know, why they
don't go the distance

00:27:50.752 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and change their eyes, that's
a really good question.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.652 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're not able to.

00:27:54.652 --> 00:27:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe
they're not able to.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.405 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody died from
being associated with them?

00:27:59.405 --> 00:28:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: There
are a lot of cases

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:07.320 align:middle line:84%
where people think these things
are an omen of some type.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Harbinger
of something bad.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Harbinger of
bad luck or bad fortune.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So you know, there
are accounts of people

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.230 align:middle line:84%
seeing these black
eyed children and then

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:84%
having a string of bad
luck which includes

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.880 align:middle line:90%
deaths in their family.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not aware of
anyone who has directly

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:84%
perished after
encountering these,

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:84%
or has as a result of
encountering these things.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.840 align:middle line:90%
But that's a hard thing to say.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I've had people
ask me in the past.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:41.319 align:middle line:84%
The unsettling question is how
many people that vanish maybe

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:90%
encountered these things?

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.318 align:middle line:90%
And we just don't know.

00:28:43.318 --> 00:28:45.820 align:middle line:84%
We really don't know how
many people have let them in.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know when we first
met at a conference years

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.350 align:middle line:84%
ago before I had you
on "Coast to Coast"

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and you were telling me
about this, I'm saying,

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.950 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get this guy on.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.920 align:middle line:90%
This is unbelievable.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have a couple topics
that just rivet people.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:84%
One, of course, is missing
people by David Paulides.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you, the
black eyed children,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:90%
which freaks people out, David.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.510 align:middle line:90%
They just can't handle it.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:17.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I would do
if I go to the door of my house

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and there are these three
children with their heads down

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and then they kind
of look up at you

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:90%
and they've got all black eyes.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.950 align:middle line:90%
That's scary stuff.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: It's
very unsettling.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But you know, George,
I think that using

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
the term "paranormal"
just in general

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to include UFOs and
hauntings and so forth.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:38.994 align:middle line:84%
I think any time you add the
element of children into that--

00:29:38.994 --> 00:29:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Spooky.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --it
changes the dynamic.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --ghosts, spooky.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Yeah.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:42.769 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And it not only
makes it creepier,

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.180 align:middle line:84%
but it also makes it more
unsettling to us as humans.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's sad.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: You can
see a hardened ghost

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:90%
hunter in a location.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:59.087 align:middle line:84%
And when a child EVP
shows up or the spirit of

00:29:59.087 --> 00:30:00.420 align:middle line:90%
a child is reputed to be there--

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They can't handle it.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.538 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --it's
very different.

00:30:02.538 --> 00:30:05.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very disturbing
to us at a core level

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:09.920 align:middle line:84%
that a child could be
trapped in spirit form.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we translate that
over to these encounters,

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:84%
it's very unsettling that
some kind of negative entity

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.610 align:middle line:84%
is able to take
the form of a child

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:25.480 align:middle line:84%
in order to get through
to our emotional selves.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something going on.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:90%
They want something.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they want our souls.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.284 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Could be.

00:30:32.284 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The clip we used
from "The Watcher" series,

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:90%
LA Marzulli's "Watcher" series.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about these kids.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: You know,
LA did a fantastic job

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:44.815 align:middle line:90%
recreating that encounter.

00:30:44.815 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, George,
a lot of times people

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.020 align:middle line:84%
will ask me what's the
most unsettling account

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.580 align:middle line:84%
or disturbing account that
you've personally heard?

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:55.757 align:middle line:84%
And for me, hands down it's
what's depicted in that video.

00:30:55.757 --> 00:30:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Here's why.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:84%
That account was from a
young military man who

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:90%
was visiting family in Texas.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And this fellow, he has
family all over Texas.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.940 align:middle line:84%
He's one of those guys
who likes to drive

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.252 align:middle line:90%
when he has the opportunity.

00:31:12.252 --> 00:31:12.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm that guy.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a great past time.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: I've driven
all over this country.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great past time.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: And you
know, I'm the guy who

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.860 align:middle line:84%
likes to get in the vehicle
and drive late at night

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and see different territory
and different stars.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.023 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm the same way as
long as it's 20 minutes away.

00:31:25.023 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So this fellow, he
decided he wanted

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to visit a different portion
of his family hours away.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.060 align:middle line:90%
He's going to drive at night.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So gets his trip ready,
his thermos of coffee,

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:90%
takes off in his truck.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And he's driving
under the stars.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:84%
He's in the middle
of nowhere, George.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Call of nature hits.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.330 align:middle line:84%
He pulls off on the
side of the road.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of
small hills and desert.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And he walks off the
road for a little bit,

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:56.960 align:middle line:90%
looking up at the stars.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.445 align:middle line:84%
He comes back after
he's finished.

00:31:58.445 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Approaches his vehicle.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.029 align:middle line:84%
Here's this kid
standing by his truck.

00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:06.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They just shows up.

00:32:06.195 --> 00:32:09.112 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Just as he puts
his hand on the-- this gentleman

00:32:09.112 --> 00:32:11.070 align:middle line:84%
has put his hand on the
door to open his truck,

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:90%
and here's this kid.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I want to go for a ride.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: With that look.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.191 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:32:17.191 --> 00:32:20.587 align:middle line:84%
And here's a hardened
military guy.

00:32:20.587 --> 00:32:24.940 align:middle line:84%
He's like, what are you
doing out here, kid?

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Same as these other encounters.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:31.337 align:middle line:84%
It develops to where this kid
is saying very simple phrases.

00:32:31.337 --> 00:32:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very pushy.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: But
terrifying this man.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.130 align:middle line:90%
I want to get in your truck.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:90%
We can go for a ride now.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Very cold.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Very monotone.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
This fellow, he's
immediately nervous.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
He's looking around
because there's no houses.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't passed another
vehicle in God knows how long.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.670 align:middle line:84%
There are no lights from houses
anywhere as far as he can see.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:57.990 align:middle line:84%
He's wondering, how
did this kid get out

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.440 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of nowhere?

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So like these other
accounts, his level of fear

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:06.737 align:middle line:84%
spikes to the point where
he jumps in his truck.

00:33:06.737 --> 00:33:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Freaks out.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Guns the
engine and takes off.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.570 align:middle line:84%
He gets a few miles
down the road and--

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.345 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --the military
training is kicking in.

00:33:15.345 --> 00:33:16.822 align:middle line:90%
He's thinking, wait a minute.

00:33:16.822 --> 00:33:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is crazy.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: This is ridiculous.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This is silly.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: This is crazy.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a
trained military man--

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.536 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just left this
poor little boy out there.

00:33:22.536 --> 00:33:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Exactly.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.580 align:middle line:90%
Hits a u-turn.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Goes back.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Drives very slow
enough to figure out

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.500 align:middle line:90%
exactly where the spot was.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Gets out.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.277 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:34.277 --> 00:33:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: No sign
of this kid anywhere.

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:37.914 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm just
curious, David,

00:33:37.914 --> 00:33:41.200 align:middle line:84%
to see what would happen
if anybody acknowledged

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.240 align:middle line:90%
this and brought them in.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:90%
What would happen?

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: Well, using the
case that we talked about

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:47.760 align:middle line:90%
earlier--

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The little boy?

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --with this little
boy encountering this child

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.590 align:middle line:90%
and close--

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.115 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You get sick.

00:33:52.115 --> 00:33:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY:
--physical presence.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you get sick.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:55.910 align:middle line:90%
There are a few people--

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.118 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, has anybody
asked them specifically,

00:33:58.118 --> 00:33:58.962 align:middle line:90%
what do you want?

00:33:58.962 --> 00:33:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Oh, sure.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why are you here?

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Sure.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But see, when you ask
them direct questions,

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:90%
it always gets redirected.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They don't answer.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.501 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: They don't answer.

00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:08.050 align:middle line:90%
They don't answer.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Almost like they're
incapable of answering?

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.779 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: It's very odd.

00:34:12.779 --> 00:34:16.110 align:middle line:84%
People have said that it
appears that these things are

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:84%
trying to hypnotize the victims
because of the monotone speech.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.719 align:middle line:84%
It appears that
they're very unfamiliar

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:24.250 align:middle line:90%
with everyday objects.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:27.630 align:middle line:84%
There was an account-- I thought
it was just kind of hilarious.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.870 align:middle line:90%
This woman was at home.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.120 align:middle line:90%
She's finishing a project.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.489 align:middle line:90%
She's by herself.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:36.096 align:middle line:84%
She's like 10 seconds
away from finishing

00:34:36.096 --> 00:34:37.179 align:middle line:90%
whatever she's working on.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And the knock
starts on the door.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:90%
And she's thinking, OK.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:42.530 align:middle line:90%
I've got to finish this.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But she can't take her mind off
that pounding, that knocking.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So in frustration, she
just throws the stuff down.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:90%
She goes to the door.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.310 align:middle line:90%
She flings it open.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And before it even
registers who's there,

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.340 align:middle line:84%
she says, why don't you use
the bleep bleep doorbell?

00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.537 align:middle line:90%
She points at the doorbell.

00:34:59.537 --> 00:35:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They don't
know what a doorbell is.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.245 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Exactly.

00:35:02.245 --> 00:35:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Standing on the porch are
these kids who look at her

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and look at the doorbell and
look at her several times

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.000 align:middle line:90%
like--

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:09.189 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:09.189 --> 00:35:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Exactly.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like the men
in black stories,

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.680 align:middle line:84%
with not knowing what
a fork is or something.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does this
happen worldwide?

00:35:16.225 --> 00:35:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: It does.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:17.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:35:17.885 --> 00:35:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: It does.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.813 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I first started
looking at the cases, of course

00:35:20.813 --> 00:35:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I was getting ones
that were domestic.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
maybe this is regional.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Because there are clusters
in the United States.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.050 align:middle line:84%
If you live in Texas
or the Midwest,

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:84%
you're probably much more
likely to encounter them.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.390 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
cluster in California.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But then they start to spread
out the more you probe into it.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.910 align:middle line:90%
So a lot surfaced from Florida.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Then I started getting
cases from abroad.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.181 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we getting more
or less cases than we used to?

00:35:48.181 --> 00:35:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: I think
there are more,

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.680 align:middle line:84%
but there are a lot more people
that are tracking them now.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Several investigators--

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Since you
came on our radio show,

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:58.329 align:middle line:90%
it's gotten bigger and bigger.

00:35:58.329 --> 00:35:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:35:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I can't
honestly take all the credit.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Jason Offutt was
writing about these things,

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Brad Steiger.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Other people were tracking them.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.460 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't do a
complete comprehensive study

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.170 align:middle line:90%
of the phenomena.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But now, as you say, more
people are looking at it.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
accounts all the time.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:17.970 align:middle line:84%
I get these accounts
all the time, George.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And they can come from
Australia, England, South

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Africa.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.610 align:middle line:84%
It's virtually everywhere,
these things are showing up.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Should people be
afraid of these entities, David?

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: I think so because
I have never in all this time

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:84%
heard of a positive response
or a positive experience

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.140 align:middle line:90%
from encountering these kids.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you get
sick somehow afterward,

00:36:43.325 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:90%
like that little boy.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.563 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: A lot of people do.

00:36:45.563 --> 00:36:47.235 align:middle line:84%
It seems the closer
the proximity--

00:36:47.235 --> 00:36:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you touch them?

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: --the more risk.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody
touched them?

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: You
know, they have.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.060 align:middle line:84%
A few people have reached
down and touched these kids.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.154 align:middle line:84%
And they report
very strange things.

00:36:57.154 --> 00:36:59.070 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman who
reached down and touched

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:03.600 align:middle line:84%
one of these kids and said
that the coldness of this child

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.160 align:middle line:90%
was just overwhelming.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't believe
that it was just--

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.041 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like the kid came
out of a refrigerator.

00:37:09.041 --> 00:37:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Right.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.183 align:middle line:84%
And she told me in confidence,
she said, you know,

00:37:12.183 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:84%
it feels like
touching a dead body.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:14.907 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:37:14.907 --> 00:37:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: It's so cold.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.690 align:middle line:90%


00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:21.090 align:middle line:84%
She reported the weird
texture to the skin.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, she became ill after
touching this child.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So the closer the proximity,
the more misfortune

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.780 align:middle line:90%
there seems to be.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What if they're dead?

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:84%
What if they're dead people that
have somehow zombie-like came

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:36.851 align:middle line:90%
back?

00:37:36.851 --> 00:37:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: You know, there
are so many possibilities

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:39.850 align:middle line:90%
with these things.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:40.775 align:middle line:90%
There really are.

00:37:40.775 --> 00:37:42.200 align:middle line:90%
There really are.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody
has a theory.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:47.259 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
it so fascinating.

00:37:47.259 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many ways
to argue the theories.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, you could
argue that they're

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:54.100 align:middle line:84%
some type of spirit because of
the way they vanish suddenly,

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and the way they
seemingly materialize.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.760 align:middle line:84%
You could argue
that maybe they're

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.070 align:middle line:90%
some kind of alien hybrid.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:02.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, they certainly
have that rather compelling

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:90%
similarity to the alien grays.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:09.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, that iconic picture of
the grays with the huge glaring

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:09.520 align:middle line:90%
eyes.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe that
is indeed their shape.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they aren't taking
a child's body or look.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's what they
look like in real life.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: This
is very possible.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:23.113 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about adults?

00:38:23.113 --> 00:38:26.170 align:middle line:84%
You mention that there are
some black eyed adults, but not

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:90%
a lot.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.469 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: More of those
cases starting to show up.

00:38:30.469 --> 00:38:32.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, some people
think that it's

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.590 align:middle line:84%
because of the evolution
of the phenomena that well,

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:37.540 align:middle line:84%
if these kids are out
there, then obviously there

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.620 align:middle line:90%
would probably be adults.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
a little jarring.

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.611 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: It is.

00:38:40.611 --> 00:38:42.500 align:middle line:90%
I think so, too.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.610 align:middle line:90%
The adults.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.270 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
looking at the cases,

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.620 align:middle line:84%
there weren't many reports
of black eyed adults.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that were there, I
had to really look at carefully

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.797 align:middle line:84%
and say well, you know, there's
possibility for hoax here.

00:38:55.797 --> 00:38:58.255 align:middle line:84%
Back when I wrote the book and
was originally investigating

00:38:58.255 --> 00:39:01.480 align:middle line:84%
it, of course you could
buy full sclera contact

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.015 align:middle line:90%
lenses for sci fi effects.

00:39:03.015 --> 00:39:04.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That looked black.

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.973 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: They used
to be very expensive.

00:39:05.973 --> 00:39:08.450 align:middle line:84%
They've come down
in price a lot now.

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But back then,
they were somewhere

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.410 align:middle line:90%
in the range of $300 for a pair.

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jeez.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: That's not
something that kids--

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now they're
novelty items.

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Yeah.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.834 align:middle line:90%
Now they're novelty items.

00:39:16.834 --> 00:39:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But you know,
that's a whole track

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.920 align:middle line:84%
that I really looked at when
I was writing the book just

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.130 align:middle line:84%
to see OK, let's look at this
from every possible angle.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And see what all the
possibilities for false reports

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:28.890 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So at the time, the few
reports of adults that came in

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.440 align:middle line:90%
were very questionable.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, since then, there
have been more encounters

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.600 align:middle line:84%
that are quite unsettling
with these black eyed adults.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.042 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
distinct possibility

00:39:42.042 --> 00:39:43.750 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing more
of these entities.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you let them
in-- children or adults--

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.222 align:middle line:84%
if you let them in, what
do you think could happen?

00:39:50.222 --> 00:39:52.845 align:middle line:90%


00:39:52.845 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:10%
It's all speculation, I know.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.916 align:middle line:10%
>>WEATHERLY: That's
a big question mark.

00:39:55.916 --> 00:39:56.940 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it is speculation.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I would think that
at the very least,

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.440 align:middle line:90%
some kind of dire illness.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Because from all accounts,
anyone who is in that

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.139 align:middle line:84%
close proximity to these
kids for very long, that's

00:40:09.139 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:90%
what happens.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I don't think
they come in to get you sick.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a byproduct
of what they are.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Sure.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like touching
radiation on a UFO.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the craft wanted
to hurt you, the occupants.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:90%
But it happens.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.175 align:middle line:90%
It's the offshoot of that.

00:40:26.175 --> 00:40:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: And
that's a good analogy.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a
result of whatever

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.790 align:middle line:84%
their-- gosh, for lack of
a better word-- whatever

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.430 align:middle line:90%
their vibration is.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:39.625 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what kind of
even physical toxins--

00:40:39.625 --> 00:40:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somehow
you just-- yeah.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Or they could have a virus--

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WEATHERLY: --that
are natural to them.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They could
be giving off a virus.

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: That's right.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows.

00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: That's right.

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
get a hold of you, David?

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Or what is your website?

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.020 align:middle line:10%
>>WEATHERLY: My website is

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.410 align:middle line:10%

the book, "The Black Eyed

00:40:58.715 --> 00:40:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Children."

Eyed Children."

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love it.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Great job, David.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WEATHERLY: Thank you.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great job.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:10%
Hey, the next time several
children come to your door

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:12.080 align:middle line:10%
and they lift their heads up
