>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:10%
Bill McKenna with us, the
founder of the Cognomovement

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.340 align:middle line:10%
and the author of
"The Only Lesson."

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to
teach a simple method

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:90%
for reaching higher dimensions.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Bill, welcome to the program.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.378 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL MCKENNA:
Oh, thanks, George.

00:00:32.378 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:90%
You know, I am so excited.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Been on your show a few times.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But this is by far
the most excited

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I've ever been
because we are going

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to share with everybody
something that

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:84%
is going to change their reality
that is going to allow them

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.510 align:middle line:84%
to access a higher dimension
and change their life easily

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:90%
and quickly.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got some
earth-shaking things to tell us.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, tell me about
Cognomovement.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: Cognomovement is a
simple exercise that utilizes

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:10%
the nervous system and the
brain to reprogram our automatic

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.563 align:middle line:10%
responses, all those things
that don't feel good--

00:01:15.563 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:10%
shame, guilt, grief,
humiliation, anger.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:10%
All those things that don't feel
good, we can make them go away,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:10%
and we can also elevate a
person's performance as well.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
get involved in this?

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: A series of what I
would call unfortunate events

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I wrecked my boat in Mexico,
and that led inadvertently

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:90%
to a spiritual awakening.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I went from
what I would call service

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:90%
to self to service to others.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you
wreck a boat in Mexico?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:90%

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I think it
was all predestined.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
It was a year prior I
had actually dreamed it,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.842 align:middle line:90%
every single detail.

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did you crash?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, like a Titanic.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I ran into an uncharted
rock down in Mexico,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.127 align:middle line:84%
and it split the side
of the boat open--

00:02:13.127 --> 00:02:14.043 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Down it went.

00:02:14.043 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: --in the
middle of the night.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who saved you?

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, we
actually ended up

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:90%
making it into the port.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
We did all the
emergency procedures

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.463 align:middle line:84%
and ended up making it
into the closest port.

00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would think the
boat would leak like a sieve?

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.282 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, it was, yes.

00:02:32.282 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Good thing
you're still with us.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Here I am.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My god.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:90%
What is physiological certainty?

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA:
Physiological certainty

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:90%
is something very interesting.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
It is when we have a certain
sensation in our body.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:90%
We have certain emotions.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a combination
of those two things,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
plus the understanding
that we come

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:84%
to so far in our lives
that creates our thoughts.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And with this, when we are
completely certain of something,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's a bad thing
that's going to happen

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
or something good, that
thing, when we're very, very

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:84%
certain about it and everything
is aligned, it tends to happen.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does that tie
into consciousness, Bill?

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So our
consciousness is

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.324 align:middle line:84%
relative to all of our
reactions in our body.

00:03:29.324 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
When we are in a state
where we're reactive,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.330 align:middle line:84%
we have fear, guilt,
grief, anger, resentment,

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that is a certain
level of consciousness,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:90%
a low level of awareness.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And as we move through the
different levels of awareness

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
to forgiveness and love and
bliss and joy and oneness,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:84%
these are other levels
of consciousness.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And all they really are is
simply just the understanding

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that we've come to as the
truth of our life so far.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It works, doesn't it?

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It does.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:90%
It's working all the time.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are different emotions
different ways of treating this?

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Our
emotions will drive

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.260 align:middle line:84%
all of our life experiences,
and it will drive our thoughts.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:84%
These come through
our nervous system.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:90%
They are simply automatic.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And with those
emotions, we will end up

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:90%
creating an actual reality.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:84%
We become very certain,
for example, that we're

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:90%
going to have a bad day.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we go
to the grocery store,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:90%
and the people are mean to us.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:84%
We get a flat tire, so on and
so forth, just the same as--

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Road rage.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: There
we go, perfect one.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.918 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Perfect
example, isn't it?

00:04:48.918 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
perfect example.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, how does
one use their senses

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.800 align:middle line:90%
to shift their dimensions?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: There is
an amazing discovery

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:84%
we made related to changing
your consciousness.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that with
different eye positions,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:90%
you can get a different feeling.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Eye positions?

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.892 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Eye positions.

00:05:15.892 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So for example, there
is a position for me.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Mine's right up over here.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:84%
When my eyes are there, I feel a
sense of universal love, bliss,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:90%
forgiveness.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:90%
All of those things are present.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.272 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Give me that look.

00:05:32.272 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Right
over there for me.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.438 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long do
you have to do that?

00:05:35.438 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You hold it only
for a couple of minutes

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:84%
or even less, and you will
start to enter into that state.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.810 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of it is that
you don't have to really try

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:90%
to change your mind.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
You may have difficult things
in your life that are happening.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:84%
But once you know the
position that is for you,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and is different for
everybody, what happens

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:90%
is that reality shifts.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I have the hugest
problem in my life.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But as I'm over here, I
see other opportunities,

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.835 align:middle line:84%
or I see that it is
not such a big deal.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does knowing how
to change your reality

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:90%
useful in your life?

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Most of us are
just going from one reaction

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:26.860 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bang, bang, bang, bang.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: One after
the next, we wake up.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:90%
We want something.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.800 align:middle line:90%
We don't get it.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
A series of unfortunate
events happens.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
All those things
actually end up just

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:84%
for most people
creating their reality.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:84%
They don't feel they
have any control over it,

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:90%
because they don't.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I know that sounds strange, but
it's their automatic reactions

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:90%
that are driving their life.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we've got
a clip of Liz Larson,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:84%
the cocreator of
Cognomovement, talking

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.110 align:middle line:84%
about the physiological
certainty,

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:90%
much like what you've explained.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.915 align:middle line:10%
- Have you ever had that
feeling that everything is going

00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:10%
to work out perfectly
for you in a situation,

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:10%
somehow you just know?

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:10%
It turns out that that's a very
particular physiological state.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.310 align:middle line:84%
We call it a
physiological certainty.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:10%
It's a combination of feelings
in your body sensations

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:10%
that all add up to you creating
a very specific timeline.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the
tension or pain in your body

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and the emotion that's
stacked on top of that.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Those together
equal your thoughts.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:84%
All three of those add
up to a consciousness,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:90%
your awareness in the moment.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
It shifts your
entire perspective.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to
be in a state where

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle line:84%
you can see opportunities,
where you're in the flow

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:90%
or in the zone.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
All of us have also had the
converse of that, where we just

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:90%
have a dread or doom.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
We know it's not going to
work out, and it doesn't.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:90%
It's actually the same system.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a physiological certainty
that things won't work out.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It's something that your
body is actually creating.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:10%
So to be in a state or the
flow where it works out great,

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:10%
you just have to know
your body's very specific

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:10%
physiological certainty.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:84%
You can get in that state and
change reality again and again

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
just by knowing your
body's very specific setup.

know these things?

00:08:41.887 --> 00:08:44.216 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.216 --> 00:08:47.938 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: A lot of studying

>>NOORY: Trial and error.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Trial and error.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, working with
a lot of people.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How does
the average person

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
tap into things like
what she just said

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:90%
and make it work for themselves?

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: It's really simple.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to
share today makes

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:84%
this fully accessible for
anybody to shift their reality.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It is as simple as a
position, whereas before, you

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:90%
would struggle.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't feel like this.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.400 align:middle line:90%
I should change my attitude.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I should treat people
a different way,

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:90%
but it's hard for me to.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know if
the reality is working for you

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:90%
or not?

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: The easy way
to tell if the reality

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:84%
is working for you or
not is, what's going on?

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.360 align:middle line:90%
What is going on in your life?

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
Einstein who said,

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:84%
you can look at the
world in two ways.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Either that nothing
is a miracle,

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:90%
or everything is a miracle.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is it's
always working for us,

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have to
go down the hard road.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:90%
You can learn.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:84%
You can grow through
either chaos or harmony.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:90%
They're both available to us.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What did the late prime
minister of Britain Winston

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Churchill have to
say about this?

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.540 align:middle line:90%
He was spot on.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: He sure was.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I believe he said that men will
often stumble across the truth

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.070 align:middle line:84%
but will promptly
ignore it and walk away.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's like
asking for directions.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same kind of thing.

how you would apply this

to your day-to-day life?

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So the easy way to
utilize this in your daily life,

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to teach,
is when things are not

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:84%
going your way, you're going to
notice a physiological certainty

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:90%
of, I'm having a bad day.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.312 align:middle line:90%
I'm having difficulties.

00:10:54.312 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Things happen.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Things
happen, flat tires.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:90%
People are mean to me here.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.350 align:middle line:84%
My coworker talked behind my
back, whatever be the case.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You lose a sale in
your business, something.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Something happened.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And the easy way to
do this is to simply--

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:84%
as you know your position,
and this position

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:90%
will be particular to you--

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:84%
is to simply put
your eyes over there.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:90%
You will see new perceptions.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle line:84%
You will be able to not
take things as seriously,

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:90%
because they aren't.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:84%
You'll see new opportunities
where you couldn't

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:90%
see the opportunities before.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to love and
forgive and be grateful.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell us about
fear and how that's

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.720 align:middle line:90%
created in this environment.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Fear is something
that really no one chooses.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
No one ever gets up
and is like, you know.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I want to be scared.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I want to be
afraid, or I want to be mad.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever chooses that.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:00.970 align:middle line:84%
But the fear is actually
an automatic response.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along the line,
in our nervous systems,

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:90%
we have a reaction.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:84%
If you pay attention, it's
somewhere in your physical body.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we get the sensation,
what happens is very,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.350 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, we'll send
the signal to the brain,

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get an
equal thought to that.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'll find something
to be afraid of.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Many people even
experience anxiety

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
where they have nothing
to attach it to.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
They realize they have
nothing to attach it to.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:84%
But they just get this
overwhelming, fearful feeling.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.843 align:middle line:84%
It's your body's nervous
system on overdrive.

00:12:45.843 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, you've got an
interesting story about a gas

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: You know,
George, I live in San Diego.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:84%
I have some VIP
Hollywood type customers.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.772 align:middle line:84%
So I got a, now and again,
drive from San Diego to LA,

00:13:02.772 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and I have to get up very
early in the morning.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a poke.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And usually, I fill
up my tank beforehand.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
night, I didn't.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But I forced me to get up
at 5:00 in the morning,

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.120 align:middle line:90%
and it's winter.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.480 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody on the roads.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm there.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm alone.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:90%
I pull into the station.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm pulling in, I
can see across the station.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:90%
The station is unmanned.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.510 align:middle line:90%
It's dark, but the pumps work.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And I can see there's a
guy over in the corner--

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Standing there?

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.505 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, kind
of milling about--

00:13:40.505 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
has that kind of methamphetamine
type of look, feel to it.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a bunch
of cash in my wallet

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and my credit
cards in my wallet.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I pull out my wallet,
and I was like, oh, no.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.817 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, oh, no, but
I take my credit card out.

00:13:57.817 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's going to see this.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, I
swipe the credit card,

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:90%
and I start filling.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.896 align:middle line:84%
And as I put the nozzle in, it
was like [IMITATING GAS PUMP

00:14:07.896 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:90%
SOUNDS].

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like I'm getting
a spit out of it.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.700 align:middle line:90%
And I go back in, up, down.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:84%
[IMITATING GAS PUMP SOUNDS]
And I keep doing this.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, man, you're
drawing attention to yourself.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.972 align:middle line:90%
Not good, Bill.

00:14:23.972 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, where's this
guy, still hanging around?

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: He's
still lurking about.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's over here
near the trash cans

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.688 align:middle line:90%
and on the other pumps.

00:14:34.688 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is he
getting closer to you?

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: No, well,
he's not that close.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:90%
He's over on the next one over.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm noticing this fear.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I said to myself,
are you doing this?

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Are you causing this
pump to act this way?

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And just as I did that, I
looked over, and there he is.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
He's in the trash can,
and he's got a bag out.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.915 align:middle line:84%
He's pulled a burger, half-eaten
burger out of the bag.

00:15:04.915 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That somebody
dumped in there?

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Somebody dumped in
there, and he starts eating it.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And he
had some other food,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and he was just
eating this food.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And I looked over, and
it went, all of a sudden,

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.765 align:middle line:84%
from this overwhelming
fierce situation--

00:15:21.765 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Concern.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Concern.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
To a compassion and a feeling
of, oh, it's not that.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:90%
And I reached in my pocket.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I got the biggest bills out of
my pocket, and I walked over.

And as I'm walking over, it's
like I can hear his prayers.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And I gave him the money.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I heard it.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:90%
I heard it.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.762 align:middle line:90%
And I went back to the pump.

00:15:51.762 --> 00:15:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
took it, of course.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: He took it
graciously, humbly, graciously.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:84%
I walked back to the pump, and
[IMITATING GAS PUMP SOUNDS]..

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So this thing is
filled up like that.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, the
realization there

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:84%
is that I literally jumped
from third dimension

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:90%
to fourth to fifth dimension.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I went from being in fear,
which is third dimension,

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:84%
to releasing all of my
judgments and my assumptions

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and feeling compassion, which
is the fourth dimension.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:90%
And I could see myself in him.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.410 align:middle line:90%
I literally was like--

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.770 align:middle line:90%
the Irish have a saying.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.400 align:middle line:90%
"All but for the grace of God."

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go I.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: There go I. This is
a return to sender universe.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And this happens
faster and faster

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:84%
as you elevate your level of
consciousness or understanding.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So whatever I am outputting,
if I am judging somebody,

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to
experience that back.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:84%
In the lower density,
everything slows down.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.450 align:middle line:84%
When you're in anger,
fear, resentment

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.569 align:middle line:84%
and you're firmly seated
in that third dimension,

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:90%
things happen slowly.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:84%
It may not return to you
for months, for years,

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:84%
for decades from someone
else at some other place

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:90%
in some other time.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
As you elevate yourself and
begin to have compassion

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and forgive and see
yourself in another,

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:90%
it will automatically happen.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.750 align:middle line:84%
It will automatically
be returned

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to you, whatever that
is, faster and faster.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you show compassion.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, if
you show compassion,

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:90%
compassion is shown to you.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And it shows up in
the weirdest way,

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:84%
that it seems
completely unrelated.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But the universe, because, in
fact, we are all one, it must.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the third dimension?

00:18:09.675 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So the
third dimension

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:84%
is simply a dimension that is
governed by conditional love.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Explain that.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So there's everything
that would be conditional here,

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.870 align:middle line:90%
even romantic relationships.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Typically, those are "I
trade you very much,"

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.440 align:middle line:84%
not really "I love
you very much."

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:90%
They have a want to it.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:84%
The other person wants as
well, but it's conditional.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.730 align:middle line:84%
There are things that may be off
limits within the relationship.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.800 align:middle line:84%
That's a condition,
and that's OK.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with the third dimension,

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:90%
fourth, or fifth.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
They're just
different dimensions.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:84%
With this conditional love, we
have laws, rules, regulations,

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:90%
yours and mine.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Everything is separate.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.650 align:middle line:90%
We have property lines.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
third dimension.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.772 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about the fourth?

00:19:02.772 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: In the
fourth dimension,

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:84%
this is where we begin to
release all those judgments

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.240 align:middle line:90%
and assumptions of the third.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And it is the home of
unconditional love.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
This is where we transcend
from the conditional

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:90%
to the unconditional.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And during this process,
we have to release

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
our judgments and
assumptions, which take time.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like I did--

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I think most people
would prefer unconditional love,

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't they?

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yes, we
would all prefer that.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of hard to get until
we can begin to get there

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves,
until we can start

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:84%
to accept ourselves and love
ourselves the way we are right,

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:90%
now faults and all.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
the fifth dimension?

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: In the
fifth dimension,

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
we end up seeing
ourselves in the other.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.510 align:middle line:84%
We end up recognizing
that that's me.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And in this state, in this
fifth dimensional state,

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
not only do you
recognize it, but you're

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:84%
filled with bliss and
love and understanding.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:84%
In this dimension,
when you think it,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
then very, very quickly, if
not instantly, things happen.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:84%
That karma is returned
back to you at that point

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:90%
almost instantly.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you do a lot of
prayer in the fifth dimension?

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So in your life
in the fifth dimension

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:90%
is your prayer.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Your love, your
feeling of oneness,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:84%
your bliss that is
your prayer, and that

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:84%
will produce the reality
that's appropriate for that.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there a dimension
you would prefer to stay in?

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: The preparation
for the fifth dimension

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.220 align:middle line:10%
is in the fourth dimension.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:10%
In the fourth dimension, it's
like the training wheels.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And in that dimension,
you're slowly

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:02.240 align:middle line:84%
letting go of all those
automatic reactions.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They all kind of gel
into each other, don't they?

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: They do, and
they're like a rainbow,

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:90%
a little bit at a time.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.205 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you know Howard
Martin from HeartMath?

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Oh, yeah.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He's a genius.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've got some video
of the HeartMath Bio-Well,

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:90%
they call it.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a device.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And how it could be used
to push us into 5D reality,

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Watch this.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.380 align:middle line:10%
- It's a little known fact that
you can change your physiology,

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:10%
change how you feel,
change what you're

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.830 align:middle line:10%
thinking by a simple shift
in your eye movement.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.440 align:middle line:10%
You see, your eye movement
accesses place cells

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:10%
in your brain that hold your
memory not just for thoughts

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:10%
but for feelings, for
whole physiological states.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
One of our Cognomovement
practitioners in the next clip

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:84%
is hooked up to a HeartMath
Institute EM Pro Plus.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It measures heart
coherence and how quickly

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:90%
you can enter that state.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:07.320 align:middle line:84%
The particular eye position
that she's going to use

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:84%
is called the love position
or the love direction.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a place
where you can put your eyes

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and access a state
of universal love.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.560 align:middle line:84%
It floods the body with
the endorphins of love.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts go to love,
and what this clip will show

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.362 align:middle line:90%
is how quickly it happens.

00:22:29.362 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:84%
- OK, now we're going to
use this Cognomovement

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:84%
technique to get the
heart and brain coherence.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:34.920 align:middle line:10%
And I know where my
love position is,

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:10%
so I'm going to
get right into it.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:84%
- Here, we see Kristen connected
to the heart coherence monitor.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Increased coherence enables
better internal balance,

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
greater health, and new levels
of creativity, resilience,

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.850 align:middle line:90%
and productivity.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.940 align:middle line:84%
A score of 3, according to
the HeartMath Institute,

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:90%
is excellent.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And we see here that Kristen
zooms right past it up

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:90%
into the 6s.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Before Kristen moved her
eyes into the love position,

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:90%
we took a Bio-Well reading.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.490 align:middle line:84%
We can see that she's a
little out of balance,

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and that her alignment
is only about 70%.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:84%
The brightly colored balls
represent her energy centers.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Here's Kristen's reading
after the love direction.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:84%
You can see that her alignment
has jumped up to 86%,

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and that her energy centers
are much larger and much more

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.840 align:middle line:84%
in alignment as they
relate to her body.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
In this next Bio-Well reading,
you see her before image

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to the
energy in her body.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:84%
You see the jagged spikes,
and you see that imbalance

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:90%
once again.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.320 align:middle line:84%
We see here that
Kristen has 51 joules

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:90%
of energy for her body to use.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.360 align:middle line:10%
Here's the reading of Kristen's
energy after the love direction.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:10%
We see that she jumped
up to 65 joules.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:10%
That's a 14-point jump.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:90%
- How amazing was that?

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.260 align:middle line:84%
In less than two
minutes, she was

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:84%
able to put herself in a
state of universal love.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:84%
- In this state, a person can
manifest very, very rapidly.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:84%
In this state, a person
could attract more love

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, maybe even
another person into their life.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:29.460 align:middle line:84%
In this particular state,
everything is in the now,

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:90%
in the present and expanding.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.070 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is truly remarkable
how that works, Bill.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: It is
remarkable that it's all

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:44.320 align:middle line:84%
done through knowing the actual
direction, your Cognomovement

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:90%
love direction.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And once you
understand where that

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
is, that you can put
yourself in that state,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:84%
the most important
thing here is,

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.170 align:middle line:84%
you know-- that video
ended obviously.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:90%
But what happened to her after?

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.650 align:middle line:90%
She had a dream that night.

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:04.600 align:middle line:84%
When she went into
coherence and she

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:84%
kept that and kept
that position,

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:84%
she dreamed about
creating a farm.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And on this farm,
she would have vets

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and help them to know
how to farm and become

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.750 align:middle line:90%
self-sustainable.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And with that,
they would also get

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:84%
help to learn about
how to overcome

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:84%
their PTSD and
that sort of thing.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Within 30 days, not only
had she bought the land.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.610 align:middle line:84%
She had created all the things
for this not-for profit.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, she needed
another million dollars

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.050 align:middle line:84%
to fit out the
land with buildings

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:84%
She had a guy who was 81
years old come to her and say,

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, I can't build
the buildings anymore.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.340 align:middle line:84%
But what I can do is cut
that million-dollar check,

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:90%
and that was just.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He just wrote it out.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Amazing,
amazing story

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
because when she kept in
coherence all of life,

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.960 align:middle line:84%
all the people around her
go into synchronicity.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.580 align:middle line:84%
The HeartMath Institute has
done a bunch of studies on this.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:84%
When you're in coherence, the
people around you can't help it,

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.430 align:middle line:84%
but they go into
coherence as well.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing work.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I can tell from you alone, Bill,
that you give off an energy

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:90%
vibe, which you can feel.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're radiating.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:90%
Have you always done that?

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, actually,
probably after 2007 or so,

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.130 align:middle line:90%
that's about when that started.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you train
yourself to do that?

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I got
a lot of training.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I had amazing masters that
ended up showing up in my life,

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:90%
and they helped me so much.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
discover the link

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:84%
between our physiological
thought and shifting dimensions?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So that,
again, was standing

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:84%
on the shoulders of giants, the
work of so many of the greats.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Dr. David Hawkins, who
developed the scale of levels

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
he was able to help

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.900 align:middle line:84%
to define that all of
these different emotions

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of energy
that they will generate.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So not only the understanding
of that but then

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.910 align:middle line:84%
the personal
experience of my life

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and being able to discover
this cognitive movement

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.300 align:middle line:84%
love position, that really
solidified it for me

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.845 align:middle line:84%
when I understood, and I could
actually feel it intensely.

00:27:56.845 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you measure a
change in the reality shift?

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: So the way that
you measure it is very simple,

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:13.720 align:middle line:90%
is, what is going on in my life?

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.110 align:middle line:84%
When you go into the
fourth dimension,

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:middle line:90%
you're going to notice--

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.230 align:middle line:84%
kind of like Kristen, that we
saw that was in heart coherence,

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.880 align:middle line:84%
utilizing the position, the
person offering her $1 million,

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
the land showing up,
the dream taking place.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems to just start
to happen naturally and easily.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:42.340 align:middle line:84%
You go from event to event
without stress, without worry,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.570 align:middle line:90%
without fear.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And the next person shows up,
helping with the next thing.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've got
a video testimonial

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:84%
of a person who was able
to shift their reality,

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.650 align:middle line:90%
truly remarkable.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.450 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.210 align:middle line:10%
- We always think
about shifting reality

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:00.970 align:middle line:10%
around major things in
our life or around goals

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:10%
or big manifestations.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:84%
But what about shifting reality
around seemingly small things,

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:90%
around everyday business?

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:84%
- A lot of us know what working
in customer service is like.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:10%
And when you're
having a bad day,

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.960 align:middle line:10%
it seems to be reflected
back to you in the way

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:10%
that customers treat you.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.010 align:middle line:10%
So I was having
one of those days,

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.020 align:middle line:10%
and I was already kind
of not having a great day

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:10%
in the first place.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.000 align:middle line:10%
And then I get an email
with an unhappy customer.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.845 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to feel irrational to
me, but they were complaining.

00:29:32.845 --> 00:29:36.140 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want what they
got, something like that.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I was starting to feel
even more irritated, even more

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.210 align:middle line:90%
flustered.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:90%
So I stopped what I was doing.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed my Cognomovement
ball, and I did my session.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to really feel
how I felt about that person,

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:90%
about the day.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of the session,
I felt really neutral.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.580 align:middle line:84%
The tension in my body
just completely relaxed.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to come into
it knowing that however I

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.780 align:middle line:84%
could make this
customer happy, even

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.430 align:middle line:84%
if that meant a refund,
that's how I would do it.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:84%
We only want happy money
anyway, and we'll replace

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.240 align:middle line:90%
that no problem, no big deal.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.940 align:middle line:10%
So I went to my computer.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.080 align:middle line:10%
And before I could
send a response,

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:10%
this lady sent me an
email back and said,

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:10%
hey, you know, I'm
really sorry I actually

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.420 align:middle line:10%
misunderstood what I got.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:10%
And there's actually so much
more to it than I realized.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:34.200 align:middle line:10%
And I would like to buy
this other course as well.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:40.100 align:middle line:10%
So I ended up turning a refund
into an upgrade with just

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:10%
a 10-minute session.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do we do this, Bill?

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Or does the universe
do this for us?

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: We're doing it,
and we are coordinating.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a cocreation.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:55.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So she was
doing her thing?

00:30:55.810 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, but it was
not only was it the resistance,

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.850 align:middle line:90%
but it was also the release.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.670 align:middle line:84%
All of it was
within her control.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:84%
She created the problem, and
she created the solution.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is negativity
or positivity so important?

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:18.683 align:middle line:90%
Because it affects it.

00:31:18.683 --> 00:31:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Absolutely.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no doubt.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah,
it is so important

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.360 align:middle line:90%
because we are creative beings.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.450 align:middle line:84%
With negativity, we'll
create that resistance.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:36.890 align:middle line:84%
We'll create that physiological
certainty of an outcome.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:41.150 align:middle line:84%
People who say, it can't
be done, I don't think so,

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:90%
and that's how their life goes.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:45.402 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
any way out, because--

00:31:45.402 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They pull that black
cloud over their head, right?

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.525 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: And
that's how they feel.

00:31:49.525 --> 00:31:50.980 align:middle line:90%
It's true to them.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:90%
They are certain of it.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But for somebody like you,
George, things go different.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's attitude.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Yes.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's the
important thing.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: When we
have this feeling

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:84%
in our body, this
negative feeling,

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
it broadcasts an electromagnetic
signal out into our field.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.430 align:middle line:84%
HeartMath actually
has measured this.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever that is,
that will be attracted to us.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's
positive or negative,

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.010 align:middle line:84%
either way, we will
get to experience it.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we're continually
throwing it out there over and,

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:84%
over whatever that might
be, in our field, then

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.000 align:middle line:90%
that's what's going to happen.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.480 align:middle line:84%
In this particular case,
it was pretty great

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.820 align:middle line:90%
that he was able to do that.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.455 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What creates
that negativity?

00:32:42.455 --> 00:32:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: What creates it?

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I've always
been a positive person.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't get how so many
people can be negative.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: They're
being programmed.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Their parents, between
the ages of 0 and 7,

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.180 align:middle line:84%
they're in what they
call a hypnotic state.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And any negativity can be taken
on by the child and program

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.720 align:middle line:84%
their nervous system,
which is the subconscious.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So they have this automatic
response through their body.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.410 align:middle line:84%
They feel it, and then they'll
just think it and say it.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
love position, Bill?

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.598 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, folks, don't
take this the wrong way.

00:33:21.598 --> 00:33:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: You know what?

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.548 align:middle line:84%
We changed the name to the
love direction because--

00:33:25.548 --> 00:33:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That might be a
little more appropriate.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: I think that's
a better way of saying it

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.306 align:middle line:90%
because it is a direction.

00:33:32.306 --> 00:33:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So this technique that I'm
going to teach you right now

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.360 align:middle line:90%
is very, very simple.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.077 align:middle line:84%
You think of somebody that you
love non-romantically, a pet,

00:33:44.077 --> 00:33:45.410 align:middle line:90%
somebody that doesn't send you--

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A friend.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: A friend.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A friend.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: A friend.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Something that doesn't
send you into grief.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:84%
For some other
people, maybe they

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.880 align:middle line:84%
don't have something
that's easily accessible.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:84%
They can think of the
most beautiful place

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.460 align:middle line:84%
that they ever were or
a painting that they

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.310 align:middle line:90%
felt was absolutely beautiful.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it was a
spiritual experience

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.540 align:middle line:90%
that sent them into bliss.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.699 align:middle line:90%
You recall that.

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And then what you do is
you move your eyes up,

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to move
them around in a big circle,

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:90%
all the way around.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to
do this one pin width.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.409 align:middle line:84%
By one pin, you'll
take, say, here,

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll
breathe three times.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:33.920 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel it.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.480 align:middle line:84%
You'll stay in that state
of that wonderful feeling,

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.520 align:middle line:90%
that blissful feeling.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice how
you feel, and then you'll

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:90%
move another millimeter over.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A little notch.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:47.929 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: A little notch.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And what'll happen is you're
going to do this the entire way

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
around notch by notch by notch,
and you're going to notice.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.130 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a
place somewhere for you

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that this feeling is going
to be enhanced dramatically.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:11.390 align:middle line:84%
There's also going
to be a place where

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.100 align:middle line:90%
somebody turned the lights off.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like over
here or something.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:17.330 align:middle line:90%
You're like, I can't feel it.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how hard I try.

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.090 align:middle line:90%
I can't feel it.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:26.450 align:middle line:84%
So once you find that
position, wherever that is, you

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.120 align:middle line:90%
memorize that position for you.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.040 align:middle line:90%
It's your love direction.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is the eye
position so important here?

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Every position
that we look in, what happens

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.950 align:middle line:84%
is it is a different
part of our brain.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And it corresponds with
this neurological circuit.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So when we find
the exact position,

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:84%
we're going to light up
that part of our brain

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that feels this, and it will
be reflected in our body.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you remember
the movie "Vegas Vacation"?

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: No, I never saw that.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With Dan
Aykroyd and Chevy Chase.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And there was a scene
where Chevy Chase

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:15.390 align:middle line:84%
asked Randy Quaid, who was
Cousin Eddie, for some money.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.385 align:middle line:84%
And Cousin Eddie's
eyes went like this.

00:36:17.385 --> 00:36:19.940 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot like what you've
been saying, eye movement.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Yeah, yeah, there's
a position for everything.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a position for
your grief, your sadness.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
develop the Cognomovement?

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Cognomovement
as an entire modality

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:39.148 align:middle line:84%
was developed by
myself and Liz Larsen.

00:36:39.148 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:90%
We developed it together.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who we've been
seeing on the video.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Who we've
been seeing online.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:48.110 align:middle line:84%
We basically started with
some very basic techniques

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:52.500 align:middle line:84%
that we thought we had an
inclination that would work.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.070 align:middle line:84%
We had people just to
feel how they felt.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And we started a physical
movement process exercise,

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and we found that those
feelings went away.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's greatly
expanded since that time.

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do people
participate in this, Bill?

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: They can
participate either

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.490 align:middle line:84%
by becoming a practitioner,
or actually, they

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:15.660 align:middle line:84%
can get a self-help
course on their own.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:84%
But most of all, I
have a free course

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:84%
for everybody about this
love direction, where

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:29.160 align:middle line:84%
they can actually learn how to
do it and the nuances of it.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's held back.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.148 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely free for
all the Gaia members.

00:37:33.148 --> 00:37:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do they get to it?

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: Cognomovement.com.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You better
spell that out.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.680 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA:
C-O-G-N-O-M-O-V-E-M-E-N-T.com.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.800 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:84%
This is so important here
that I have a special request

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.420 align:middle line:84%
of all the Gaia listeners
if they will please

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.340 align:middle line:90%
share this with everybody.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:58.380 align:middle line:84%
If everybody knew that it
was as simple as a position

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.800 align:middle line:84%
of their eyes to be
forgiving, to be loving,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.870 align:middle line:84%
to have a great life, to
have synchronicity show up,

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.180 align:middle line:90%
this is it.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.920 align:middle line:84%
This, you can share for free,
and you can improve your own

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.660 align:middle line:90%
life and everyone else's.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is it
with the eyes that you

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:18.780 align:middle line:84%
can tell somebody's emotion
just by their eye movement?

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.540 align:middle line:84%
You talk to somebody,
and they're upset.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.370 align:middle line:90%
And they go, oh.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:24.420 align:middle line:90%
You can tell.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: From
a very early age,

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:33.270 align:middle line:90%
we humans have been learning.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:36.285 align:middle line:84%
You've been watching your
parents, their disappointment.

00:38:36.285 --> 00:38:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to get a cookie?

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see the look in their eye.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.530 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm not going
to get a cookie.

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.580 align:middle line:84%
All of us all our
lives are tuned

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:48.040 align:middle line:90%
in to these subtle details.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been part
of a household that

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:55.585 align:middle line:84%
was abusive in some
way, son of an alcoholic

00:38:55.585 --> 00:38:57.210 align:middle line:84%
or daughter of an
alcoholic, you become

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.360 align:middle line:84%
very sensitive about looking
at these little details.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what about people
who don't look you in the eye?

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.540 align:middle line:90%
And you've seen them.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.910 align:middle line:90%
You've talked to them before.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.040 align:middle line:84%
They got their
eyes on the floor.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.630 align:middle line:84%
They look over your shoulder,
but they don't look at you.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.570 align:middle line:10%
What are they doing wrong?

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:10%
>>MCKENNA: Loving themselves.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.035 align:middle line:10%
They don't--

00:39:20.035 --> 00:39:21.660 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They're not
loving themselves.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.618 align:middle line:90%
>>MCKENNA: They're not.

00:39:22.618 --> 00:39:23.820 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Insecurities?

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Insecurities,
yes, exactly, exactly.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.481 align:middle line:84%
Afraid of being
judged, not enough.

00:39:32.481 --> 00:39:36.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is solvable.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
It turns out for
myself as an example,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.450 align:middle line:84%
there's a self-love position,
and mine is right here.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I put my eyes
right there, I'm OK.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm all right, and
you're all right too.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When I met you in the
dressing room earlier today,

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.850 align:middle line:84%
you had a glow about you,
but I noticed your eyes.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Have you trained
yourself to do this?

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Or is it natural?

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:07.621 align:middle line:84%
>>MCKENNA: Well, I think it's
just how things are for me now.

00:40:07.621 --> 00:40:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, there's been
so many wonderful teachers

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:15.422 align:middle line:84%
that have come into my
life, and I'm so grateful.

00:40:15.422 --> 00:40:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've learned well.
