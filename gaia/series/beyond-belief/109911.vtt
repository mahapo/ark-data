00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.712 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[THEME MUSIC] And I think
many people today don't

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:08.920 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.260 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.345 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:25.469 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory with our
special guest tonight-- Michael

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.610 align:middle line:10%
Heiser, biblical
expert-- on prophecy.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:84%
If you missed our first program
with him, on the Old Testament,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:84%
make sure you go
back and look at it

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:84%
because you really
need that foundation

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
as you watch this program on
the New Testament, Michael,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:90%
welcome back.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.325 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL HEISER: Thank you

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:52.085 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What exactly
is the New Testament?

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:10%
>>HEISER: The New
Testament is a collection

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:10%
of 27 books, again in our canon,
our Protestant Bible, and not

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.232 align:middle line:10%
coincidentally in Catholic
collections, as well.

00:01:01.232 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:10%
So there's a lot more
agreement here than there

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:10%
is with Old Testament.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.706 align:middle line:10%
So you have stories
of the life of Jesus.

00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
You have the story
of the early church.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.996 align:middle line:84%
You have letters that
were passed around

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:14.347 align:middle line:84%
between the apostles in
churches or between churches.

00:01:14.347 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
finally you get the Book

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:90%
of Revelation, which is--

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is the scary one.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.433 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: --that everybody
gravitates to that one.

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:22.812 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, the Old
Testament was pre-Jesus.

00:01:22.812 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Mm-hmm.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The New Testament
is Jesus and onward.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Right,
and a good bit of it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.650 align:middle line:84%
is-- you don't really
have anything written

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:90%
contemporaneous to Jesus.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.321 align:middle line:90%
It's shortly after.

00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:38.945 align:middle line:84%
Again, in Christian theology the
death, burial and Resurrection

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:43.450 align:middle line:84%
is the catalyst chain
of events that triggers

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:90%
the birth of the early church.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the apostles
start preaching about what

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:90%
they'd seen and heard.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they
look at themselves

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.594 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, we're
getting older here.

00:01:52.594 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:84%
We ought to write
this stuff down.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
get the Gospels.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
There's this sense
that, well, we

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
thought the Lord was
going to return soon,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.153 align:middle line:90%
because he promised.

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:90%
He said he would come back.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.350 align:middle line:90%
But we're getting older.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.516 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know what's
going to happen exactly,

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:90%
what the timing of all this is.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So we need to write this
material down because we're not

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:90%
going to live forever.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:90%
It may outlive us.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they produced
the Gospels.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
a lot of letters,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
again, written to existing
Christian communities,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
churches all over
the Mediterranean.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.132 align:middle line:84%
And those get grouped into
the New Testament, as well.

00:02:25.132 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, you travel
all around the country talking

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:90%
about biblical prophecy.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.525 align:middle line:84%
So Michael, who exactly
wrote The New Testament?

00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Well,
the New Testament

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:90%
has a number of authors.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Probably it's fair to say
a little over half of it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.070 align:middle line:84%
would be from the hand
of the apostle Paul.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who writes most of
the letters back to churches.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And again, those were
intended to be circulated.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.160 align:middle line:84%
We actually know
that from the content

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:90%
of a few of those letters.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.420 align:middle line:84%
He actually asked that
they be passed around.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
Peter wrote a couple.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:90%
John wrote a couple.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
The Gospels, of course,
have four different authors.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And John, who wrote
one of the Gospels,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
is also the author of
the Book of Revelation.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So they
write these Gospels.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Who consolidates
them and combines

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.194 align:middle line:84%
them to make this book
called the New Testament?

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It's actually an interesting
historical question

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.850 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
modern myth about this.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
The modern myth is that
Emperor Constantine

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
decided which books were going
to go in the New Testament.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
That's a misnomer because
at the Council of Nicaea--

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
which, again,
Constantine was part

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:84%
of getting that thing to
be held-- what Constantine

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
actually asked was that, hey,
you religious authorities now,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
you need to quit talking
about all this material, all

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:90%
these books.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:90%
You need to put it together.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.669 align:middle line:90%
And I want 50 copies of it--

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To give to my friends.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I want it distributed
through the empire.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:90%
So it puts them in a pickle.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.254 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Because now
they have to decide,

00:03:59.254 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:90%
how are we going to do this?

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And is
Jesus already gone?

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.103 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Jesus is already gone.

00:04:03.103 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:90%
This is in the 300s AD.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is considerably
after the fact.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, most of
the apostles are gone.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:90%
They're all gone.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.495 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Yeah.

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
You've had all this
material circulating

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.519 align:middle line:84%
in the early
Christian communities.

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.768 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's in written form?

00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: It's in written form.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:84%
And Constantine, again,
when he issues this order,

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:24.826 align:middle line:84%
it's not like you can say,
well, that's a hard job to do.

00:04:24.826 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Or we don't really
want to do it.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:90%
Or it's going to cause argument.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:84%
No, you have to do it
because he's the emperor.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.167 align:middle line:90%
Or off with your head.

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: At his command, they
have to start making decisions.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And so what they decided
to do was they take

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.580 align:middle line:90%
a really minimalist approach.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.790 align:middle line:84%
They say, what are the
books that basically

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.280 align:middle line:84%
every Christian community
and tradition accepts?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:90%
That was the easy path.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.777 align:middle line:90%
And it makes some sense, too.

00:04:49.777 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Now, you get a Gospel
like Thomas-- which is not

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
in the collection-- the
reason Thomas is not,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
is it was not accepted
really anywhere as having

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
the same status as Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.657 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: It's a mystery,
because all the Gospel

00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:90%
of Thomas is--

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.415 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was Doubting
Thomas, wasn't he?

00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:08.285 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Yeah.

00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the namesake of it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not really a gospel.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it doesn't
have stories of Jesus.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So that might be, again, part
of the reason why was excluded.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Thomas is really
a collection of sayings,

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.661 align:middle line:84%
like proverbs, this pithy,
short, little sayings.

00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They found it boring.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:90%
They didn't want to put it in.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: And it doesn't
resemble the others.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So even in the East--
where the Gospel of Thomas

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.277 align:middle line:84%
is thought to have originated
by Gnostic scholars--

00:05:35.277 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:84%
even in the East you
don't have it accepted.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.526 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
because there was

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:84%
a man named Tatian who created
a harmony of the Gospels.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.084 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like the
life in Christ in stereo.

00:05:47.084 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I want
to put them all together

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:90%
and see how it reads.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:84%
He only uses the
four that we know.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't even use
Thomas, even though it

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.650 align:middle line:84%
was very current in his
own area in his own time.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So again, for whatever
reason, Thomas

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.400 align:middle line:84%
was never put, again,
at the same level,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:90%
even in those communities.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are his
books out there?

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Well, the
Gospel of Thomas is known.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Again, it has been discovered.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.710 align:middle line:84%
It has plenty of
manuscript evidence for it.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:14.680 align:middle line:90%
So that one is known.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, that's just part
of the decision-making process,

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:90%
their approach.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
did the smart thing.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was left on
the editing room floor.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Yeah.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what are
the ones that are not

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:90%
going to cause arguments?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And we'll call that our
core collection, our canon.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
produce the New Testament.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, theologically, again,
a theologian discussing this

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
would say something like,
well, the Holy Spirit

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.390 align:middle line:90%
was part of that process.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And he led them to recognize
which ones belonged in there.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And you actually have that as an
important part of the dialogue.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:90%
We think of a book like Enoch.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.022 align:middle line:84%
There were a handful of
people in the early church--

00:06:53.022 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
Old Testament, right?

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Well, it deals
with the Old Testament

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.260 align:middle line:90%
character, Enoch.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But it actually
has this crossover.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's like amplified
Old Testament.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But there were people who
thought that Enoch should

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.760 align:middle line:90%
be included in the canon.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Peter and Jude
both quote from it.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's the rest of
the story of Genesis.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.365 align:middle line:90%
It was a very popular book.

00:07:17.365 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So you actually have discussions
among early church thinkers

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:90%
about what to do with Enoch.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of them actually
says, well, I've

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
been defending this
book all my life.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And apparently the
spirit of God is going

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:30.880 align:middle line:90%
to work with the majority.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm really the only
one still alive

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.070 align:middle line:84%
that's defending this
thing, so that's OK with me.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So there was this sense that
providentially God would direct

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
their decision-making into what
books belonged and what books

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:90%
didn't.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And so finally, Constantine
pushes the button and says,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.120 align:middle line:90%
look.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.009 align:middle line:90%
Enough of the debate.

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Enough of the talk.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.716 align:middle line:90%
Enough of the writing.

00:07:50.716 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Enough of the commentary.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I want the New
Testament on my desk

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.904 align:middle line:90%
in short order, so to speak.

00:07:56.904 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In two weeks.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.792 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: He forces them
to make the decision.

00:07:59.792 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:90%
He's not the one who does it.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.650 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.505 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
Gospels that were put

00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
in together by the apostles--
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Paul-- were they all
self-contained on their own?

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, did each one talk
about basically the same things

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
with a different
perspective, based

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:90%
on the apostle who wrote it?

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Or did they just have
different stories

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:90%
all through the whole Gospels?

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Well, of the
four gospels-- Matthew,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Mark, Luke, and John--
there are three-- Matthew,

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Mark and Luke-- that are
referred to as the Synoptic

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Gospels.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And that is to see together.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.309 align:middle line:84%
Those books are, to
a very high degree,

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:45.717 align:middle line:84%
covering the same
events Maybe not--

00:08:45.717 --> 00:08:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With a
different perspective.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Different perspective.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not in the same order,
there'll be some differences.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the differences are
due to who their audience was,

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.870 align:middle line:84%
what they want to say, what
they don't want to say,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.615 align:middle line:84%
what the purpose
of the occasion is.

00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:00.958 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean,
do they all talk

00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.944 align:middle line:84%
about the birth of Jesus
and that evolution?

00:09:02.944 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Interestingly
enough, you only

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
get the birth of-- the Magi
story-- in only one of them.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:09.941 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:09:09.941 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.637 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Now, John--
well, John is 90% unique.

00:09:13.637 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 90% of what's in
John isn't in the others.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So it really depends on what
message they're really after.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
The birth story with
Jesus, you get most

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:90%
of this information in Matthew.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Because Matthew is the
Gospel that is most Jewish.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:84%
For instance, Matthew
will use terms

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
that the other Gospels
have to define.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Matthew never does it.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Hebrew terms, Jewish terms,
customs and that-- he never

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:90%
explains anything.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So you can tell that
his audience is Jews

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't have
to do any of this stuff.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:90%
And so he includes the birth.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Weren't
they all Jewish?

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: They're not.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Luke was a Gentile.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Mark was Jewish.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
But when Matthew is
tracking on certain things,

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.230 align:middle line:84%
he wants to take his
readers from the birth all

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:84%
the way through
the Resurrection,

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and specifically to establish
that this person was

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.882 align:middle line:84%
the correct person
in the line of David.

00:10:07.882 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
He's the fulfillment
of the Davidic

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Covenant of the Old Testament.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:90%
And he is the King of the Jews.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.064 align:middle line:84%
And so he presents
a Jewish messiah.

00:10:16.064 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Luke does less than that because
he's writing to a friend.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:84%
He tells us in the very
first couple verses.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yet the Jews
don't accept that.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:22.704 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: They don't.

00:10:22.704 --> 00:10:23.280 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Many of them did, because
the early church comes out

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:90%
of Judaism.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.058 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've interviewed
on the radio show who

00:10:29.058 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:90%
believed Jesus was the Messiah.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Yeah, you have
Messianic congregations today.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there's
not a lot of them.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:90%
There isn't.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:84%
But Luke is doing something
entirely different.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.017 align:middle line:84%
He's writing to a guy
named Theophilus--

00:10:39.017 --> 00:10:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But if you were going
to look at and read the Gospels

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.620 align:middle line:84%
generally, would you
see the same story,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:84%
the story of the devil trying
to cut a deal with Jesus,

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.281 align:middle line:90%
and he rejected him, and things.

00:10:52.281 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Would they all be there?

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: All three of
the Synoptics have that.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Again, they don't-- I often
get the question about, well,

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
this is a little-- we can't
really accept the Gospels

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:84%
because they disagree
on this or that point.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.592 align:middle line:84%
And my view is that's
why you should accept it.

00:11:08.592 --> 00:11:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Because
what would you think

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.349 align:middle line:84%
if I handed you three gospels,
and you read them all,

00:11:13.349 --> 00:11:14.390 align:middle line:90%
and they're all the same.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.306 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All the same.

00:11:15.306 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: I mean,
I'm a professor.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:90%
When I get papers--

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Plagiarism.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
When I get two papers that
look exactly the same,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:90%
I know something's wrong.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: But you don't--

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they sat
next to each other.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.768 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
that with the Gospels.

00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
You have them track through
a lot of the same events.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:84%
But again, even the
ordering can be different.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it's stylistic,
or rhetorical, again,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:90%
audience-aimed.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.238 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Michael, then I
want to get into Revelation.

00:11:37.238 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:84%
But are you convinced
that the stories

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.940 align:middle line:84%
they have written
about Jesus are all

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.942 align:middle line:84%
factual based on the
things you've read?

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Mm-hmm.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I think they are.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a person that would
believe Jesus never existed

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Even atheist
scholars-- Bart Ehrman

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:90%
is a very famous scholar.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will say
he was-- he existed.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say--
well, Bart Ehrman

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:84%
will say that he
certainly existed.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:84%
He disagrees with the Zeitgeist
community and things like that.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really
an idea that's

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.760 align:middle line:84%
tied to a specific tradition
to say that Jesus existed.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:84%
When you ask about, well,
what about all the stories?

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Are they factually correct?

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to have
a difference of opinion.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's any
story about Jesus that has ever

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:90%
been demonstrated to be false.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:84%
It's an odd question
because what you'd need then

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.290 align:middle line:84%
is you need other
versions to compare to.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:90%
And you don't have a whole lot.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.680 align:middle line:84%
You have the Gospels, and you
have other stories about Jesus

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.360 align:middle line:90%
that circulated.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:84%
But again, when it came time
to-- at Constantine's behest--

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.704 align:middle line:84%
saying look, the Christians
around the world,

00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:84%
what are the ones, the
stories-- again, the Gospels.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.786 align:middle line:84%
We'll just narrow the
question to the Gospels.

00:12:53.786 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
What are the ones where
everyone embraces this?

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Everyone thinks they're genuine.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:90%
They're not disqualified--

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or stories.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.666 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Because of contrary information.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.359 align:middle line:90%
Which are those?

00:13:06.359 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:90%
And those are the ones we have.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And so you do get
this-- in that way

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:90%
you get an external validation.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.338 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you think they knew

00:13:13.338 --> 00:13:18.730 align:middle line:84%
about the Immaculate Conception
and the birth in the manger?

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think
that came from?

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: I think since
Mary survives, of course,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:90%
after Jesus, and she travels.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, in the Gospels
you have indications

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that she was part
of the group that

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.290 align:middle line:84%
followed Jesus around and
listened to what he was saying.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.040 align:middle line:84%
After the Resurrection
and the ascension,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:84%
she's part of the
community there.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:44.159 align:middle line:84%
I think at that point she
tells them, essentially,

00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
you guys know a lot about
what happened to Jesus.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
You lived with him for
three and a half years.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.363 align:middle line:90%
You traveled around.

00:13:48.363 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But I've got some other things
to tell you that he may not

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:90%
have shared with you.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So she's an eyewitness
to some of these events

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:90%
that they are not privy to.

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:90%
But she's part of the group.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.092 align:middle line:84%
And so they worked themselves
into the Gospel accounts

00:14:04.092 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:90%
really, I think, through her.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
natural thing to do.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Book of
Revelation, written by John

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.392 align:middle line:84%
when he was sent off to
an island, wasn't he?

00:14:12.392 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Mm-hmm.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:90%
He was exiled to Patmos.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.355 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he claims
what happened to him?

00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:19.855 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Well, he claims that,
right there at the beginning

00:14:19.855 --> 00:14:21.104 align:middle line:90%
of the book, the heavens open.

00:14:21.104 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:90%
He sees the risen Christ.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And basically Jesus says,
I want you to write down,

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.507 align:middle line:90%
I'm the first and the last.

00:14:30.507 --> 00:14:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And I want you write what things
that you're going to see that

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:90%
happen now.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Alpha
and the Omega.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:34.896 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:14:34.896 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Now and in the hereafter.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And so that initiates a series
of visions, some of which

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.430 align:middle line:90%
have Jesus in them.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Others are directed by angels.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:84%
You have these
angelic mediators.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:90%
And John will say that.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, after this happened,
then I was met by an angel.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:90%
Or an angel showed me.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Or an angel did this or that.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And so he is taken-- either
mentally transported.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you can really
argue that he was physically

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
moved into the presence
of God or whatever,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:84%
because you have a lot
of vision language there.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:90%
But he sees these things.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Then he's told specifically,
write these things down.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And at some points he'll
ask, what does it mean?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes he's told;
sometimes he's not.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you interpret
the Book of Revelation?

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:10%
>>HEISER: Well,
it's really common

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:10%
nowadays-- this is actually
a trickier question

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.505 align:middle line:10%
than you may realize, George.

00:15:26.505 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Maybe I'm
trying to trick you.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:10%
>>HEISER: No, you're
not trying to trick me.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:10%
It's only tricky because there's
so much argument about it.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There is, yeah.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Most people
will look at Revelation

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and assume that you
read it chronologically,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.240 align:middle line:90%
in a linear fashion.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Here's the start.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Here's the finish.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:90%
I think there's some of that.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:84%
But I also think there's
something that scholars

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:90%
call recapitulation.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is you'll
have events described, and then

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:84%
the same four, five, six
events will be described again.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.481 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you have
these circular recountings

00:15:58.481 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:90%
of things that happened.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At different times?

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like "Star Wars."

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.546 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: You might
have something

00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
happen in chapter
12 that mirrors

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.401 align:middle line:84%
something that happened
in chapter four, something

00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:10.900 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:90%
So that happens, too.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
it jump around?

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: I think
a lot of it has

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:84%
to do with-- there is a
chronological sense that there

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.320 align:middle line:84%
are things that are
going to happen on Earth.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're dealing with
space, time there.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And things happen
in linear fashion.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So those things
have to be laid out.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But I think the repetition
occurs just for that reason,

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:37.650 align:middle line:84%
that these things are reinforced
by virtue of the repeated

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:90%
cycles.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And when the cycles sometimes
differ a little bit,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.920 align:middle line:84%
you get a little bit of
a nuance from one symbol

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
to the next that rounds out
the picture of something.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.150 align:middle line:84%
You might be wondering, well,
how do I interpret these four

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:90%
symbols here?

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you get four
things over here,

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.910 align:middle line:84%
it might give you a little
bit of a different angle

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:90%
to approach it from.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So you start to
develop a picture

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.759 align:middle line:90%
by virtue of the repetition.

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
part of the reason.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it truly Mark
the end of the beginning?

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Or is it the
beginning of the end?

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.369 align:middle line:90%
Revelation.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.437 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: I think both.

00:17:13.437 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's some
scary things in there.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.895 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Yeah.

00:17:15.895 --> 00:17:19.607 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some sense--
there's some truth to both

00:17:19.607 --> 00:17:20.440 align:middle line:90%
of those statements.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the Book of Revelation
ends with a global Eden.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, it's
taking you back to Genesis.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So In the broad sweep
of biblical theology,

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.257 align:middle line:90%
what the whole thing--

00:17:33.257 --> 00:17:34.589 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're here, here, here.

00:17:34.589 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Yeah.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.970 align:middle line:84%
What the entirety of it
is about-- if you ask,

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.240 align:middle line:84%
what's the Bible
about-- initially

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:90%
it's about God wanting a family.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:84%
God already has a non-human
family, with the sons of God.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
We're told in Job Chapter
38 that they're around

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:90%
before the creation.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.835 align:middle line:84%
God wants a family
that's embodied.

00:17:52.835 --> 00:17:54.015 align:middle line:90%
He wants a human family.

00:17:54.015 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
He creates Earth so that
they can live there.

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:84%
He's going to live
there with them.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:90%
And we call this place Eden.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And when God has
a family, he wants

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:84%
them to work with him
to make the whole world

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.040 align:middle line:84%
like this wonderful
place that we call Eden.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.399 align:middle line:84%
And he wants both of his
families to live together.

00:18:12.399 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Far from it right now.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.815 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Far, far from it.

00:18:14.815 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we know the story,
the Edenic story, the serpent,

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.710 align:middle line:90%
the whole bit.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Evil enters the world.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:84%
It gets magnified in
Genesis 6, the sons of God,

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:90%
the whole flood, all that stuff.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So the rest of the
Bible is about restoring

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.740 align:middle line:90%
this thing that was lost.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And eventually you
get to the end.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.412 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it ends.

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a glorious end.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:35.703 align:middle line:90%
It's a glorious end.

00:18:35.703 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But to get
there is horrendous.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: And people
ask a lot about, well,

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.880 align:middle line:84%
why-- if there's a
god, why is there

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:90%
all this evil in the world?

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.637 align:middle line:90%
We have to understand--

00:18:44.637 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The tragedy,
everything else.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.928 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: It relates
to the whole imaging

00:18:47.928 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:90%
concept in Genesis chapter 1.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, this
is why it's plural.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Let us create
humankind in our image.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:84%
God is speaking to
his heavenly host.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:90%
So in some way we're like God.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But were also like
them, and they're

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.100 align:middle line:84%
like us, and all
this sort of thing.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:90%
We share divine attributes.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
One of those
attributes is freedom.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if we
did not have free will,

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.092 align:middle line:90%
we could not image God.

00:19:10.092 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:90%
It would be impossible.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: So God decides,
I'm going to take-- again,

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
God knows what the
result is going to be.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:21.054 align:middle line:84%
But he deems the risk preferable
to not having humans at all.

00:19:21.054 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So he knows they're
going to fall.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:84%
He knows they're
going to be corrupt.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:84%
He knows they're going to
use their free will to commit

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.530 align:middle line:90%
acts of evil.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And sure, God could
eliminate that.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
But it means
eliminating humanity.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:31.412 align:middle line:90%
John 3:16--

00:19:31.412 --> 00:19:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And free will.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:33.036 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:19:33.036 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:90%
"For God so loved the world."

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:35.715 align:middle line:90%
God loves humanity.

00:19:35.715 --> 00:19:37.205 align:middle line:90%
He loves the world.

00:19:37.205 --> 00:19:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's why we have
the whole story of Christ,

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and the crucifixion, the
Resurrection, and all that.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
But God cannot eliminate
free will without eliminating

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.315 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:19:49.315 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And because he
loves people, he is

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:84%
willing to let this
thing run its course.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: However sad it may be.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.973 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: However sad it may be.

00:19:57.973 --> 00:20:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But what we miss, when
we look at the evil,

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.210 align:middle line:90%
we miss God's agents.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:84%
We miss the fact that God does
send divine beings in our path

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:84%
to help us, or save
us, or correct us.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.280 align:middle line:90%
God uses his human imagers-- us.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.826 align:middle line:84%
What we do and say
to people matters.

00:20:14.826 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
you do and say

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:84%
has a ripple effect in
someone else's life.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And then that life will have a
ripple effect in another life.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this is actually
the biblical picture

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:90%
of how God works.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
eliminate humans-- I could

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:90%
do that-- because I love them.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.950 align:middle line:84%
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
to work within this
thing I've created--

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:84%
the space-time continuum,
however you want to picture it.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
make sure that it

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:90%
ends the way I want it to end.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.050 align:middle line:84%
We often use this chess
master illustration.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.809 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
everything's predestinated.

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:90%
There are biblical reasons why.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:90%
We could get into that.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But to me, what's
more impressive--

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
if you and I are playing chess,
and I'm God, and I look at you,

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.397 align:middle line:84%
and I say George, you're
going to lose this chess

00:20:58.397 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:84%
match because I've
predetermined every move.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.359 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In nine moves.

00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: OK, that
sounds impressive.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:90%
But this is more impressive.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
If I said to you, George, it
doesn't matter where you move.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm still going to win.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:90%
I will have my way.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:90%
That is a lot more impressive.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:16.768 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is.

00:21:16.768 --> 00:21:17.767 align:middle line:90%
It's more dramatic.

00:21:17.767 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Than just
predestinating it.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you
think the apocalypse,

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.670 align:middle line:84%
the sign of the beast,
the Antichrist--

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:84%
all those things we need to
do to get to this new Eden--

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.135 align:middle line:90%
are going to happen?

00:21:30.135 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Yeah.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I do think-- I believe
in a personal Antichrist.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We may be in it now.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: We might be.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, since I don't
read Revelation

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.280 align:middle line:84%
as a completely
linear document, it

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:90%
does create that possibility.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.090 align:middle line:90%
There is signage.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:84%
This whole concept,
again, of astral prophecy.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:84%
There are significant things
going on in the New Testament.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Probably the question you
run into all the time is,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:01.080 align:middle line:84%
the signage that was associated
with the birth of Jesus,

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:90%
is that going to repeat?

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And does that mean anything in
the scope of biblical prophecy?

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first
question is easy.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's going to repeat.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.590 align:middle line:84%
You can just plug it into
an astronomy program.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:84%
It's more than the star
in Matthew chapter 2.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.825 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe-- and
there are other scholars

00:22:20.825 --> 00:22:21.540 align:middle line:90%
who believe this.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.447 align:middle line:84%
And I'll confess, I'm
in the minority here.

00:22:24.447 --> 00:22:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's happened before.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.446 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Right.

00:22:26.446 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not alone.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:84%
That Revelation 12 tells
us what the Magi saw

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:34.940 align:middle line:90%
in real, considerable detail.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
read Revelation 12,

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:84%
we have a woman with 12
stars around her head.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:10%
The sun is in her midst.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:10%
The moon is at her feet.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:10%
There's a dragon ready to
devour the child that she's

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:10%
going to give birth to.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you interpret
that astrally,

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and you plug that into
an astronomy program,

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:84%
you can calculate when
those things happen.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.684 align:middle line:84%
And, I think, not
coincidentally,

00:22:58.684 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:84%
if you do this--
and I've done it.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the only one
that's done this.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:84%
There are other
events specifically

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that explain the
star in Matthew 2.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:84%
There is a conjunction
of Regulus,

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.855 align:middle line:84%
which is the king star
in ancient thinking

00:23:11.855 --> 00:23:13.105 align:middle line:90%
because it's the biggest star.

00:23:13.105 --> 00:23:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And programming software
will show you that, right?

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: It'll show you.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:90%
And there's Jupiter.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Regulus and Jupiter, the
king planet, conjoin.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.642 align:middle line:84%
And that creates
retrograde motion,

00:23:22.642 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
which is why the star appeared
to move, and all this stuff.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that the
Star of Bethlehem?

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: I think it is.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think you're right.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: But here's the kicker.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:84%
If you go beyond the
star in Matthew 2,

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and you add all those other
elements from Revelation 12 in,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:84%
there is a very
tiny window of time

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.370 align:middle line:84%
when that could occur--
all those things

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:90%
as they're described.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a 90-minute window
that actually gives us

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.160 align:middle line:90%
the birth of Jesus.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And again, the spooky
part is it turns out

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:90%
to be September 11, 3 BC.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: It is.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not December 24?

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Not Dec-- no.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:84%
That's a Roman--
part of the Roman

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Empire in correlating the
calendars and all that stuff.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.962 align:middle line:84%
September 11, 3 BC
is also Tishri 1

00:24:08.962 --> 00:24:11.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Jewish calendar, the
original Jewish calendar.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.461 align:middle line:84%
Jewish calendar-- how they
have half a dozen calendars.

00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But the one that was used
before the Passover event.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Tishri 1 is Rosh Hashanah
in that calendar.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was the day
traditionally in Old Testament

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.700 align:middle line:84%
when the inauguration of a new
king's reign would be held.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:90%
So the imagery is just perfect.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it well known
now that 911 may have

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.094 align:middle line:90%
been the birth date of Jesus?

00:24:37.094 --> 00:24:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: I don't
think it's well known.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.670 align:middle line:84%
But I when I say it,
people get spooked by it

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.495 align:middle line:90%
because of the 9/11 thing.

00:24:41.495 --> 00:24:42.322 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of Course.

00:24:42.322 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: So the
question comes up.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, is all this
concatenation of events,

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:90%
is that going to happen again?

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's easy because all
you could do is plug it in,

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and you get dates for when
that's going to happen again.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:84%
The bigger question, though,
is does it mean anything?

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a specific verse
in the New Testament that says,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:84%
hey, at the time of
the end, all this stuff

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.690 align:middle line:84%
that you saw happen back here
is going to happen again.

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.705 align:middle line:84%
And that'll be the sign
of the Second Coming.

00:25:13.705 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a
verse that says that.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to try to relate

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:23.240 align:middle line:84%
all of that with the sign of
the Son of Man in Matthew 24,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.280 align:middle line:84%
associated with
the Second Coming,

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:90%
that is your speculation.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.878 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: Because you
don't actually have-- you

00:25:29.878 --> 00:25:32.640 align:middle line:84%
don't even have the sign of
the Son of Man identified.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Is it that stuff
from Revelation 12?

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it something
altogether different?

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Is the sign of the Son of Man
the event, the return itself?

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.667 align:middle line:90%
Or is it something celestial?

00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:43.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
of that information.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
actually deliberate,

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a believer
in Messianic prophecy--

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:84%
specifically Messianic prophecy
being deliberately cryptic.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think the 666 means?

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.925 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: 666, I think, is about
astral, specifically solar,

00:25:58.925 --> 00:25:59.425 align:middle line:90%
imagery.

00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:02.010 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.730 align:middle line:84%
It's an odd-- that's
probably an answer that's

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:84%
going to surprise a
lot of your listeners.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:84%
But it goes back to,
in the Old Testament,

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.360 align:middle line:84%
this thing called the
abomination of desolation,

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.790 align:middle line:90%
spoken of by Daniel the prophet.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Jesus mentions this.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, that prophecy
was considered

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:27.390 align:middle line:84%
to have been fulfilled at least
once before Jesus gets here.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Because that is a
title-- the abomination

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.950 align:middle line:84%
which makes desolate--
that is applied

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:39.640 align:middle line:84%
to Zeus, who was the god whose
image Antiochus Epiphanes set

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:84%
up in the temple in the
intertestamental period.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a horrific
event to Jews-- lots

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:90%
of bloodshed, persecution.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.580 align:middle line:84%
He installs a pagan idol in
the temple, and it's this guy.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that wasn't the
whole story, because Jesus

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:90%
references the same passage.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus lived
after that event.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
still out there.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you take a
correlation there,

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:05.452 align:middle line:84%
then it has something to do with
Zeus, who is the solar deity.

00:27:05.452 --> 00:27:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And there were Christians
trying to figure out, well,

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.730 align:middle line:90%
what's the connection?

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.489 align:middle line:90%
Here's just one trajectory.

00:27:10.489 --> 00:27:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
of magic squares?

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: OK.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.770 align:middle line:84%
The magic square
for the sun is 666

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
because you've got all the rows,
the four rows of the squares,

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:84%
add up to 111 and
the two diagonals.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:90%
You get 666.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:10%
So people would
look at that and go,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.550 align:middle line:10%
there's got to be
something going on here.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.090 align:middle line:10%
Early church fathers took
the word "teton", which

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:10%
is reference to the Titans.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Zeus was a Titan.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.720 align:middle line:90%
By gematry, it adds up to 666.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Is that a coincidence?

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.802 align:middle line:90%
Well, who knows?

00:27:36.802 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:90%
You have these pointers.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: See, and
I don't think--

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.097 align:middle line:90%
there are no coincidences.

00:27:40.097 --> 00:27:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything is meant.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Michael, we're
almost out of time.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HEISER: I think it has
something to do with all that.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But fascinating work.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.966 align:middle line:84%
Where do people peruse
some of the things you do?

00:27:46.966 --> 00:27:47.840 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:10%
>>HEISER: My home
page is drmsh.com--

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.105 align:middle line:10%
doctor and then my
initials, MSH-- .com.

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you go there, you
can get pretty much access

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.790 align:middle line:90%
to anything I do.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.950 align:middle line:10%
I'd recommend if people are
interested in astral prophecy,

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:10%
to check out "The
Portent," which

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.510 align:middle line:10%
is my sequel to "The Facade."

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.307 align:middle line:10%
I do a lot of astral
prophecy stuff in that book.

00:28:08.307 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you're interested
in that, I would get that.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.665 align:middle line:84%
Michael, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:28:12.665 --> 00:28:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HEISER: Thank you.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Biblical prophecy.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:90%
What has happened?

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.340 align:middle line:90%
What could happen?

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:10%
A lot of it determines what
we do with our own free will.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.560 align:middle line:10%
Think about that for a moment.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.760 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and
this is "Beyond Belief."
