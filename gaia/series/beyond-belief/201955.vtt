>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief".

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:10%
A scholar of Hebrew language
and literature and the history

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:10%
of the Jewish people,
from ancient times

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:10%
to the Holocaust and
beyond, Dr. Ken Hanson, PhD,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:10%
is the coordinator
of the Judaic Studies

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:10%
at the University of
Central Florida in Orlando.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Ken discusses the true story
of the Wailing Wall, Rabbi

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
emeritus Yehudah Getz,
who in 1982, dug deep

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:84%
through a long sealed tunnel
underneath Jerusalem's

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.830 align:middle line:84%
fabled Dome of
the Rock, claiming

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:84%
to have encountered the long
lost Ark of the Covenant.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Ken, welcome back
to "Beyond Belief".

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KEN HANSON: Good to be
back with you, George.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How are your
hunts and your mysteries?

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:90%
They seem to be abound.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: They are
abounding indeed.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:10%
I've written a whole new
book, in fact, about some

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.960 align:middle line:10%
of these stories,
which are just amazing.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
It's history and
archaeology combined

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:84%
with some incredible
human interest stories.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:90%
"Whose Holy Land?"

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
archaeology meets geopolitics
in today's Middle East

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:84%
the only place on
Earth where archaeology

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:84%
is involved with political
dispute and often

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.200 align:middle line:90%
even violence.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: If we could only
get things resolved out there,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
what an area it would
be, wouldn't it?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Wouldn't it be nice
if we could all just get along.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:10%
Having lived in Israel myself
and in Jerusalem for over three

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:10%
years, what an incredible place.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.370 align:middle line:84%
There's an area, in
fact, of the Old City,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
it's about one square mile
called the Holy Basin.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:84%
It's an appropriate
name, because you've

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:84%
got the three great religions
of the Western world,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Judaism, Christianity,
and Islam,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
with their holy sites exactly
in this one square mile basin.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And what a treasure
trove for scholars,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:84%
for theologians, anyone who
just has an inquisitive mind.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.165 align:middle line:90%
You can walk the trails.

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
If you want to walk
where Jesus walked,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you
where Jesus walked.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.563 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh my god.

00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel the energy
when you're out there?

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you actually walk
on land that Jesus walked on,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:90%
can you feel that?

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: If you're open
to the energy, oh my.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.700 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I remember very clearly as
a young student of history

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
coming to Jerusalem
for the first time

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and laying eyes on the
Temple Mount, which is now

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:84%
occupied by the great
Muslim shrine called

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:90%
the Dome of the Rock.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Golden shrine.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.648 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And just to look
at that, to behold it.

00:02:55.648 --> 00:02:57.065 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's
enormous, isn't it?

00:02:57.065 --> 00:02:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's an enormous
shrine, but the beauty of it

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And it sits, I'm convinced,
exactly in the spot

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:84%
where the ancient
temple of Solomon

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and later the Temple of
King Herod once stood.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: In fact--

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: There's a lot
of gold there somewhere.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --there
was an archaeologist

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
in the 1970s, Leen Ritmeyer,
who was able to place cameras

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
high up inside the golden
dome and photograph

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.417 align:middle line:90%
the floor of that Muslim shrine.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: From above down?

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Above
and looking down.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: All right.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Now, the floor right
in the center of it is bedrock.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
It's been open from the time
that the shrine was built back

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:90%
in the 600s of the Common Era.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the very
first time with goose bumps

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.095 align:middle line:84%
walking into that Muslim shrine,
and looking at that floor,

00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and noticing there
are all manner

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:84%
of different indentations
and grooves in that bedrock

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:90%
that the dome is over.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And Leen Ritmeyer was able
to do precise measurements

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
of the indentations,
the grooves, as it were,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%
in the bedrock.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered that those
measurements are exactly

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:84%
the measurements of the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Whoa.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.660 align:middle line:90%
That are described in the Bible.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.172 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Described
in the Bible.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And tell us, Ken,
about the Ark of the Covenant.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:90%
What is its purpose?

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Why does it seem to be
such a great mystery to try

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.315 align:middle line:90%
to discover it and look for it.

00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: Everybody
wants to know

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:10%
about the Ark of the Covenant,
ever since "Raiders of the Lost

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:10%
Ark", of course.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.170 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.212 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: And there's a
lot to get excited about.

00:04:33.212 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:10%
I brought, in fact, a
little representation of--

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:10%
people say, is this the
Ark of the Covenant?

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.498 align:middle line:90%
And I tell them, actually, no.

00:04:41.498 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It looks like a
little version of it, though.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Doesn't it, though?

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:84%
This is a replica of an
ancient Egyptian chest

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.970 align:middle line:84%
of the kind that would have
been found, for example, in King

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Tut's tomb.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.690 align:middle line:84%
We have a little
Egyptian amulet, in fact,

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:84%
in Tut's tomb, that
depicts a chest just

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
like this, with statues
of the winged Isis,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:84%
touching their wings
above the chest.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm a scholar,
and scholars like

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:84%
to question everything and
even dismiss whatever they can.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.080 align:middle line:84%
"Ah, the Ark of the
Covenant is just a fable."

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it was
just a fable made up

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:84%
centuries later by Israelites
living in another land,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:84%
why would they fashion
their Ark of the Covenant

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
to look almost
identical to furniture

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:90%
found in King Tut's tomb?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
How would they even know
what that looked like?

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Exactly, exactly.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.043 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: It's remarkable.

00:05:30.043 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Golden covered-- and
of course you're not

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.150 align:middle line:84%
supposed to open the
Ark of the Covenant,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:84%
but in there would have been
the two tablets of the Ten

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%
Commandments given by Moses.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:90%
People think--

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: God to Moses.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.318 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: God to Moses.

00:05:45.318 --> 00:05:47.240 align:middle line:84%
People think, well,
the Ten Commandments,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
must've been five written on one
tablet and five on the other.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.250 align:middle line:90%
Actually, not likely.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.378 align:middle line:84%
It's likely that all 10
were written on each tablet.

00:05:55.378 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: On each tablet.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because
this was a covenant,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and a covenant is
a legal agreement.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a contract.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.960 align:middle line:84%
This was a contract between
God and the people of Israel,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have two copies,
just like in a modern contract.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What is it--

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: God's copy,
the people's copy.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.048 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What is
it about the Ark,

00:06:12.048 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Kenny, where they say
that if you do open it,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:84%
you could be killed,
like some burst

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:90%
of some energy or something.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.120 align:middle line:90%
What is that all about?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, the Ark was
said to have brought victory

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:90%
in battle to the Israelites.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And indeed the Ark
accompanied the Israelites

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:84%
across the Sinai, and
into the Promised Land,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.740 align:middle line:84%
during the conquest of
the land under Joshua.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it was
captured by the Philistines

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
in one of the
subsequent battles.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And the Philistines discovered
that the Ark brought

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:90%
upon them horrible plagues.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So much so that they said,
we can't handle this anymore.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:90%
We're sending it back to you.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.417 align:middle line:84%
So there was some kind
of awesome power--

00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: A power
source of something.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.958 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --that accompanied
the Ark, according

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:90%
to the Bible at least.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:84%
They sent it back
to the Israelites,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:84%
to a place called
Kiryat Ye'arim, where

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.350 align:middle line:84%
it stayed for a very
long time, apparently,

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:84%
after the Philistines
sent it back.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, archaeologists
have actually

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:84%
been digging in Kiryat Ye'arim,
looking for any traces of it.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But they did find
an ancient shrine there,

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:84%
like an ancient temple, where
such a thing might in fact have

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:84%
been held until such time as
it was brought up to the Temple

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:90%
in Jerusalem.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:84%
First, it was brought
up by King David

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:84%
to Jerusalem, then Solomon,
the great King Solomon

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:84%
built a temple where
the Ark was housed.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And then mysteriously it
disappears from the narrative.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Here is a little representation
of the Temple of Jerusalem.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: It's gorgeous.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Solomon built
one, and then King

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Herod the Great built an even
grander version of the temple.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.260 align:middle line:90%
This is King herod's temple.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:84%
The rear part of the
temple, the aft part,

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:84%
was a special chamber called
the Kodesh Hakodashim, the Holy

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.418 align:middle line:84%
of Holies, separated
by a curtain

00:08:10.418 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the structure.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.543 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How many
people could go in there?

00:08:13.543 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Only Israelite
priests were allowed to enter.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:84%
The people themselves stayed
in the courtyards outside.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Only the Israelite priests
and only the high priest

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle line:84%
went into the Holy
of Holies one time

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
a year on Yom Kippur,
the Day of Atonement.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.693 align:middle line:90%
That's where the Ark was held.

00:08:32.693 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How long do you think
it took to construct that?

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
That's a gorgeous facility.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It took decades alone
under King Herod the Great

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:90%
to construct this.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
He built it on an enormous
limestone platform

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that he also had constructed
of enormous limestone ashlars.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:84%
The platform is
still there today,

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
even though the
temple was completely

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.950 align:middle line:84%
destroyed by the Romans
and the Dome of the Rock

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:90%
now sits in its place.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
That platform took
a natural hill

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and turned it into a huge
plateau of an area of some 24

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:90%
football fields.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the size
of this platform,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
that still adorns the center
of Jerusalem to this day.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's
gotta be inspiring.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got a
program on Gaia called

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:90%
"Secret Life of Symbols".

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Scholar Jordan Maxwell
talks a little bit

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.132 align:middle line:84%
about the Ark of the Covenant
tied into the Egyptians.

00:09:28.132 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:10%
>>JORDAN MAXWELL: To
emphasize that there

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.010 align:middle line:10%
were a lot of secrets
and mysteries in relation

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:10%
to the Ark that maybe people
still don't know today.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:10%
So the most important secret
of all concerning the Lost

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:10%
Ark of the Hebrews
is that was not

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:10%
Hebrew at all to start with.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:10%
There was no Hebrew
Ark in history.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:10%
The whole idea of an Ark
of the Covenant, covenant

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.740 align:middle line:10%
simply means contract.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:10%
And so the whole idea of the Ark
of the contract, or covenant,

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:10%
was not Hebrew at all.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.870 align:middle line:10%
It was Egyptian.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:middle line:10%
And so let me show you
what I'm talking about.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:10%
If you go to Bible dictionaries
and look up the word "ark",

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:10%
you will see that even the
Bible dictionaries tell you

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:10%
that the very word ark
comes from the Egyptian,

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:10%
and then it shows you
a typical Egyptian ark.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:10%
And then if you go to
another Bible dictionary,

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:10%
it talks about the Egyptian
ark, or the sacred chest.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:10%
And so now you
begin to see, when

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:10%
you start doing the research on
the Lost Ark of the Covenant,

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:10%
you begin to see that
a lot of pictures

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.870 align:middle line:10%
have come out of
the ancient world,

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:10%
showing you that the Egyptians
had an ark, not the Hebrews.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.240 align:middle line:10%
And here is an Egyptian
ark, and an Egyptian priest,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.760 align:middle line:10%
in an Egyptian museum.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:10%
So my point in showing
you this is the fact

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:10%
that the Lost Ark of the
Covenant was borrowed.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.268 align:middle line:10%
The idea was borrowed
from the Egyptians.

00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What do you
think of that, Kenny?

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's exactly what
I've been talking about.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But it actually helps
to establish the historicity

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:90%
of this account.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole
group of scholars,

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.910 align:middle line:84%
being a scholar,
known as minimalists.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I respect them.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.150 align:middle line:84%
They try to suggest that most
of these biblical stories

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.752 align:middle line:84%
were just fabricated,
just basically made up.

00:11:23.752 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Just great stories.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Great stories written
many centuries after the fact,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and we should not
take them literally.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, I get it.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Possible.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Possible, but
when we find uncanny details

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:84%
in the biblical
text that would not,

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
could not have been
known centuries later?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:84%
If I were writing a story
about, I don't know,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
China 1,000 years ago, would I
know exactly the kind of dress

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:90%
that was worn?

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Would I know the
kind of furnishings?

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You'd make it.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah, I'd make it up.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And yet to come up with
an Ark of the Covenant

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
that looks
authentically Egyptian,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
as if Israelites
really were living

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
at some time in ancient Egypt
and came out in a great exodus,

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
it's controversial even to
say that in academic circles,

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
because so many deny that the
Israelites ever were in Egypt

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:90%
or there ever was an exodus.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
But the Ark is actually one of
the best proofs that we have.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now,
Rabbi Yehudah Getz,

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
we talked about him at the
beginning of the program.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Who is he?

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Rabbi
Yehudah Getz was known

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
as the Rabbi Emeritus
of the Western Wall,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:90%
also called the Wailing Wall.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
He was a die hard
zealot modern Israeli,

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
who had a passion to uncover the
whereabouts of the sacred Ark.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, bear in mind that with the
creation of the state of Israel

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:84%
in 1948, the Eastern
half of ancient Jerusalem

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.310 align:middle line:90%
fell to the Palestinian Arabs.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.193 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It was actually
annexed by the Hashemite

00:13:03.193 --> 00:13:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Kingdom of Jordan from 1948,
Israel's war of independence,

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.670 align:middle line:84%
until 1967, the Six Day
War, when Israel reconquered

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.180 align:middle line:90%
all of this territory.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.043 align:middle line:84%
That's what is so
controversial today.

00:13:18.043 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: To this day.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But all of Jerusalem
suddenly fell to the Israelis.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.140 align:middle line:90%
The Israelis.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
That means the Old
City, the ancient sites,

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:84%
which were off
limits to Israelis,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to Jews, frankly,
from 1948 to 1967,

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
if you're Jewish,
if you're an Israeli

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and you want to visit
the Western Wall

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and just pray
there, well, there's

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.390 align:middle line:84%
a no man's land
you have to cross.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:90%
You can't get into this area.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:90%
This was a war zone.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The
Israelis retook it.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Rabbi Yehudah Getz was there,
and he said, "I am living here.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm living right
in the Old City."

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is he dead now?

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he is.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.840 align:middle line:84%
But he had a passion
to actually start

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
digging underneath the rubble
of centuries along the Western

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Wall.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What made him
think the Ark was there?

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because if we
consider where the Temple stood

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:84%
in antiquity, on this
enormous limestone platform,

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
all of this area had been
covered in centuries of rubble,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
but Yehudah Getz wanted to dig
along underneath the rubble,

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:90%
and he did so.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And they gave
him permission to dig.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Yes, the Ministry
of Religious Affairs

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.168 align:middle line:90%
gave him permission to do this.

00:14:30.168 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:10%
And he started
tunneling, and he came

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:10%
upon a gate discovered by
a British archaeologist

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.832 align:middle line:10%
back in the 1800s,
Charles Warren.

00:14:39.832 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:84%
They called him The Mole,
because he was always

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:90%
digging underground.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.940 align:middle line:90%
The Mole, I love this guy.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And Getz came upon
Warren's Gate,

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and he said, if I dig through,
if I open a hole essentially

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
in Warren's Gate, I can actually
follow the ancient tunnels

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:84%
to the area right underneath
where the ancient temple stood.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And if the Ark of the
Covenant is anywhere,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:90%
I bet it's down there.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Wow.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.610 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, there have
been rumors that the Ark

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:90%
is in a church in Ethiopia.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that's the case, why
can't we just go to that church

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:90%
and find out?

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: There is a story that
in the days of King Solomon,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:84%
of course, the
Queen of Sheba came,

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and that perhaps when she
went back to her kingdom

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:84%
in the south,
Ethiopia, presumably,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
she may have brought
the Ark with her.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And the story is that it
remains in a church in Ethiopia,

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:44.658 align:middle line:84%
a place called Axum to this
day, also in tightest secrecy.

00:15:44.658 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I have a little bit of
a problem with that.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Because frankly, I don't
think that the Queen of Sheba

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:90%
came from Ethiopia.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the way maps
were set out in ancient times,

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.290 align:middle line:90%
the point up was not North.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:90%
It was East.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
They looked at a map
with East looking up.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And South would have been
to the right of the map.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, the word "right"
in Hebrew is "yamin".

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And there is an ancient
kingdom called Yemen.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:90%
"Yemen", "yamin".

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Ah-hah.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And all we
know from the Bible

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:84%
is that the Queen
of Sheba was queen

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
of the south, which
would have been right,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.010 align:middle line:90%
yamin, on the ancient maps.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:84%
I think she was from Yemen,
not from Ethiopia at all.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Now, the digging
for this tunnel, of course,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:90%
is it mysterious to this day?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Or have people gone down there?

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well,
Rabbi Getz actually

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.300 align:middle line:84%
entered through the tunnel,
through Warren's Gate,

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and he said he was
overwhelmed with emotion.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
He wrote in his journal, "I
sat there for a long time,

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:84%
sprawled helplessly with warm
tears streaming down my face."

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Really?

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's what
he wrote in his journal.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:02.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, up above, on the
Temple Mount platform,

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:10%
sounds of digging were heard.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were
immediately suspicious

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:84%
that someone was down underneath
the Dome of the Rock, perhaps

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
trying to sabotage it,
or undermine it, or even

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:90%
blow it up.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Oh my gosh.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's where the
geopolitics comes into play.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Yeah, how disgusting.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And there have indeed
been plots by certain radical

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Israelis--

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm serious-- to blow
up the Dome of the Rock.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if this is
where the Temple stood,

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:84%
we want a new temple
to be built there,

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and that will usher
in the messianic age.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And this
is the way to do it.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.975 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: When
they heard digging

00:17:34.975 --> 00:17:39.150 align:middle line:84%
underneath, they sent down
Arabs, obviously, workers,

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
workmen with trawls
to defend the place.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And they came upon Rabbi Getz
underneath in those tunnels

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.070 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Already there.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Already there.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And of course a
scuffle broke out.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:84%
There was fighting,
basically rioting.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And rioting did, in fact,
erupt all over Jerusalem.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.765 align:middle line:90%
Rabbi Getz had to leave.

00:17:58.765 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How big
was this tunnel, Ken?

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many
people did it support?

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It was quite an
enormous tunnel, because again,

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:84%
this platform, 24
football fields in area

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and it was supported by
massive limestone arches

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
in order to flatten what had
originally been a natural hill.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And it was
about 40 feet underground?

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's where the
tunnel that Rabbi Getz was,

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:90%
in fact, yes.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And he came into
this new tunnel,

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:84%
because he charged
through Warren's Gate.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And nobody had been
in this tunnel before.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
This is directly underneath
the Dome of the Rock,

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:90%
or leading to that area.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Did he claim
the Ark is still there,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.860 align:middle line:90%
buried somewhere?

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well,
there was discussion

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.178 align:middle line:84%
that he told his friends that
he actually saw it down there.

00:18:43.178 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: He saw the Ark?

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: That's what
he told his friends.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.737 align:middle line:90%
Now, this may be apocryphal.

00:18:46.737 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:84%
All we know is what he
wrote in his journal.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Would he make it up?

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But had to--
yeah, that's the question.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:84%
He had to leave quickly,
and the Israeli government

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:90%
said seal that gate.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:90%
Do not go in there anymore.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Seal it with concrete.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.358 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is still possible to
travel that tunnel to this day.

00:19:01.358 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:90%
I've walked through many times.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Is it still sealed?

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yes.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.770 align:middle line:84%
We go along the tunnel that
Getz had originally dug,

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.100 align:middle line:84%
which was perpendicular to
the Western Wall itself.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
We get to Warren's Gate,
and there is the concrete.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.453 align:middle line:90%
You cannot go through.

00:19:15.453 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:90%
You cannot go through.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Kenny tell us
about the Western Wall,

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.715 align:middle line:84%
and then I want
to look at a clip

00:19:19.715 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:90%
to give us that illustration.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.243 align:middle line:90%
What is the Western Wall?

00:19:23.243 --> 00:19:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The
Western Wall, again,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:84%
a part of this enormous
artificial platform

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that King Herod the Great
built to support his temple.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, the rear part of the
temple was the Holy of Holies.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
Ark originally sat.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Mm-hmm.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But now you have
an artificial platform

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:45.630 align:middle line:84%
with a retaining wall
all the way around.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Western side
of this retaining wall

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
is the closest area you can
get to where the Temple would

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.603 align:middle line:84%
have stood and where the Holy
of Holies would have been.

00:19:55.603 --> 00:19:57.187 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: And that's
the Western Wall.

00:19:57.187 --> 00:19:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: So that's
the Western Wall.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
They sometimes call
it the Wailing Wall.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.948 align:middle line:84%
It actually sticks out further
to the south in this direction.

00:20:03.948 --> 00:20:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: All right,
well, let's look

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.830 align:middle line:90%
at an illustration about this.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:10%
>> The entire length of the
Western Wall is 1,500 feet,

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:10%
almost a third of a mile.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:10%
Today, we only see approximately
180 feet, the Western Wall

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.420 align:middle line:10%
plaza that we all know today.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:10%
Where is the rest?

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.820 align:middle line:10%
Where did it disappear?

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.550 align:middle line:10%
Today, most of the
Western wall is

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:36.830 align:middle line:10%
covered by the houses
of the Muslim Quarter.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:10%
In just a moment, we're gonna
enter the Western Wall tunnels

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:10%
and uncover the rest
of the Western Wall.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:49.600 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.970 align:middle line:10%
A pilgrim ascending
to the Temple Mount

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:10%
needs to purify
himself beforehand.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:10%
And so anyone
coming to Jerusalem

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:10%
has to bathe in a ritual bath.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.340 align:middle line:10%
In Hebrew a mikveh.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe Jesus himself bathed
in one of these mikvehs.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:10%
After walking a few
seconds in the tunnels,

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:10%
we've reached the Western Wall.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm standing near
the largest stone

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.080 align:middle line:10%
found in the Western Wall.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:10%
Its length is over 40 feet long.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.595 align:middle line:10%
That is longer than a bus.

00:21:26.595 --> 00:21:33.330 align:middle line:10%
Its height, almost 12 feet high,
and its depth inside, 14 feet.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.890 align:middle line:10%
How much does it weigh?

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.440 align:middle line:10%
Almost 600 tons.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:10%
That is equivalent to 200
elephants, or to 10 tanks,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:10%
or even to two 747 jumbo jets
with the people and the luggage

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.400 align:middle line:10%
after shopping in Israel.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.930 align:middle line:10%
This large stone was carved at
a quarry in the northern parts

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:10%
of the Temple
Mount, brought down,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:10%
lifted up three stories
high, placed symmetrically.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.280 align:middle line:90%
And the big question is, how?

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.112 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:22:06.112 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's what I
was gonna ask you, Ken.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.875 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:22:08.875 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:90%
How did they do this?

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Amazing.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that stone many times.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the largest
items, objects ever lifted

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.960 align:middle line:90%
before mechanized machinery.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.168 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: How did they do it?

00:22:21.168 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: 570 tons.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:84%
You could try to roll
it on wooden logs.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It'd crush the wooden logs.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't it?

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think I know.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Tell us.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because
there are limestone

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:84%
quarries right in the
vicinity of the Temple Mount.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.160 align:middle line:90%
You can see them even today.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Solomon's Stables, for example,
so-called Solomon's Stables,

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:84%
we have quarry marks
all in that area.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It's underground today.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Probably this stone was cut
round, like a huge column,

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and then rolled literally on
an earthen ramp up into place.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when it was in
place, it was squared off.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: How many people
would it take to push this?

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Thousands
and thousands.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.295 align:middle line:84%
And King Herod was a
literal slave-driver.

00:23:08.295 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: It's bigger
than the pyramid.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Now, the
Romans destroyed

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
everything that was free
standing on the Temple Mount.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:84%
the Temple itself, all of
the walls that stood above,

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:84%
but they could not
destroy the Temple Mount.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:90%
Those stones still remain.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And what I would like
to know is, why can't we

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.830 align:middle line:90%
all just get along?

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Why can't Jews get
along with Muslims,

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Muslims get along Jews?

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's the
$64,000 question.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And what a tragedy
that there actually were plots

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:84%
to destroy, to blow up
the Dome of the Rock

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.500 align:middle line:90%
launched by radical Israelis.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Now the rest of the
Israeli population

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:90%
condemns these people.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.130 align:middle line:90%
They should be condemned.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Of course.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But it only takes
one or two bad apples.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.910 align:middle line:84%
One of them, around the same
time that Getz was digging,

00:23:53.910 --> 00:24:00.480 align:middle line:84%
had actually purloined some
600 pounds of high explosive

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.450 align:middle line:84%
from the Israeli army, that
he was planning to use to--

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: To blow it up.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: --blow up
the Dome of the Rock.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Just to--

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, so that we
can build a new temple there.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Now, what is the Rock?

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Now, the
Israelis foiled the plot.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: When they
talk about the Rock?

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: The rock
is that bedrock

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.887 align:middle line:84%
that I talked about,
with those grooves in it,

00:24:16.887 --> 00:24:18.210 align:middle line:90%
that you can see to this day.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
When I first saw those
grooves, I had no idea.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I thought, that's curious,
those grooves are in there.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Only later did Leen
Ritmeyer discover

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
those match the size of
the Ark of the Covenant

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and the Holy of Holies itself.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And with 24 football
fields up there,

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.750 align:middle line:84%
there is room to build another
temple up on top of the Temple

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Mount without damaging, without
hurting the Dome of the Rock.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:90%
There is another Israeli rabbi--

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:84%
actually, he's
originally American,

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.277 align:middle line:84%
but he became a member of
the Israeli Knesset, which

00:24:47.277 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:90%
is their parliament.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: His name
is Yehudah Glick.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And for many years,
he has had a vision

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
of bringing Jews, Israelis, up
to the top of the Temple Mount

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:84%
just to walk around
there, to pray.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.240 align:middle line:84%
This is not to do anything, not
to harm the Dome of the Rock

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.040 align:middle line:90%
but just to pray.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right, right.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And the
Israeli authorities,

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:90%
the police have said, no.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: They don't
want them there.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because
it's too incendiary.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Finally, they let him walk up
around the top of the Temple

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.235 align:middle line:84%
Mount, but they said,
but you can't pray.

00:25:16.235 --> 00:25:17.610 align:middle line:84%
You can walk, but
you can't pray.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:90%
No praying.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:18.990 align:middle line:90%
If we catch you praying--

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: No praying.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: I mean, unbelievable.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:84%
In 2014, he was
actually accosted

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.270 align:middle line:84%
by an unknown motorcyclist
right after he gave a speech,

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:31.958 align:middle line:84%
and the motorcyclist
pulled up to him

00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:33.750 align:middle line:84%
as he was getting into
his car and shot him

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.127 align:middle line:90%
in the chest four times.

00:25:35.127 --> 00:25:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Did he kill him?

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: No, miraculously--
miraculously, he survived.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And he has retained his
passion to open the Temple

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.075 align:middle line:90%
Mount to people of all faiths.

00:25:46.075 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: He's still alive.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.325 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: He's still alive.

00:25:48.325 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:90%
He's still up there, in fact.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:10%
In 2018, he actually
brought two lambs up

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.890 align:middle line:10%
to the top of the Temple Mount
and sacrificed them up there.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.960 align:middle line:90%
This is Jewish ritual--

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I'll bet that
they didn't like that.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: No, they
didn't, and rioting

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:84%
has broken out in
the Islamic part

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.220 align:middle line:90%
of the city over such things.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Israeli police
have tried to stop him.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Earlier this year, in fact,
2020, he was up there again.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.600 align:middle line:84%
He brought a group of
visitors, of tourists,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:84%
up to the top of
the Temple Mount,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:90%
where you're not supposed--

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can go
there as long as you

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.400 align:middle line:90%
stay within your boundaries.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.820 align:middle line:84%
You cannot deviate from the
path, and you cannot pray.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And the police
found him up there,

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.470 align:middle line:84%
claiming that he was
deviating from the path.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And they accosted
him immediately,

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.570 align:middle line:90%
and he sat down in protest.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this on
Israeli television.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.440 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I saw the event happen.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.273 align:middle line:84%
And they dragged him away, and
took him off, and arrested him.

00:26:46.273 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Went to the police
station, because they

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.842 align:middle line:84%
said he was veering off
of the prescribed path.

00:26:50.842 --> 00:26:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Well, let's look at
this controversy of the Dome,

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Ken.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:57.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The Dome of the Rock is one
of the most iconic buildings

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:10%
in the world, showing up in
travel posters everywhere

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.230 align:middle line:10%
as an integral part of
the Jerusalem skyline.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the
most sacred sites

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:10%
in the world for Muslims today.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:10%
Believed to be the site of
the Prophet Mohammed's night

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.080 align:middle line:10%
journey and ascension, a story
briefly told in the Quran

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:10%
and expanded in later
literature, in which Mohammed

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.110 align:middle line:10%
miraculously travels from
Mecca to Jerusalem overnight

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.320 align:middle line:10%
before ascending into heaven
to meet the prophets and God.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.570 align:middle line:10%
The building is also a
source of controversy,

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:10%
as it stands on the same
spot as the First and Second

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:10%
Jewish Temples, the
holiest site for Jews

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.210 align:middle line:10%
and a site of vital importance
to their religious history.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:10%
Control of the
Temple Mount itself

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:10%
or as it's called by
Muslims the Haram al-Sharif,

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:10%
the noble sanctuary, remains in
a delicate political balance.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.190 align:middle line:10%
The Israeli government
controls access,

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:10%
but the Jerusalem Waqf, an
Islamic administrative body

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.040 align:middle line:10%
largely funded by the
Jordanian government,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.250 align:middle line:10%
manages all of the affairs
in the sanctuary itself.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.160 align:middle line:10%
For a building that
looms so large in history

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:10%
and modern politics, what
even is the Dome of the Rock?

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.055 align:middle line:10%
What was it used for, and
what's its status today?

00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:10%
First of all, it's
important to realize

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:10%
that the Dome of the
Rock is not a mosque,

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.210 align:middle line:10%
but better described
as a shrine.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.720 align:middle line:10%
However, we're not exactly
sure about its original meaning

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:10%
and intended ritual function.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: That's a gorgeous
facility, isn't it?

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's one of the most
beautiful buildings I have ever

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.490 align:middle line:90%
laid eyes on.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I first
lived in Jerusalem,

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.350 align:middle line:84%
it was much easier to walk
around up on the Temple Mount.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I've been inside the Dome
of the Rock many times.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:84%
I've also been in
the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:90%
There is a mosque.

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Why have
things changed?

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Because of the
peace process, to be honest.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Because now Israel has
allowed the creation

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.500 align:middle line:90%
of a Palestinian Authority.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sure.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: In preparation
for a Palestinian state.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And the walk which was
mentioned in the video

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:84%
here controls this area on
top of the Temple Mount.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The Israelis gave them
control under the Palestinian

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Authority, and they've
made it much more difficult

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.300 align:middle line:84%
for non-Muslims to
go up to these areas.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Ah-huh.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Which I think is
a shame, as long as people

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.290 align:middle line:90%
respect the religions.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's the bad apples
that ruin everything.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Way back in 1967, there was
another great Israeli rabbi,

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Rabbi Shlomo Goren, who also
had designs on destroying

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.490 align:middle line:90%
the Dome of the Rock.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sheesh.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And he
even mentioned this

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:31.390 align:middle line:84%
to one of Israel's great
war heroes, Uzi Narkiss, who

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:84%
helped to liberate the
Jewish Quarter of the city

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:35.950 align:middle line:90%
during the Great War.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.938 align:middle line:84%
And he said to
Uzi, "Look, we need

00:29:37.938 --> 00:29:39.730 align:middle line:84%
to blow up the Dome of
the Rock, so that we

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:41.410 align:middle line:90%
can build a new temple."

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.235 align:middle line:90%
But Uzi--

00:29:42.235 --> 00:29:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's terrorism.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.277 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Yeah, it is.

00:29:44.277 --> 00:29:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And Uzi Narkiss, who represents
the great majority of Israelis,

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:90%
he said, "Rabbi, I respect you.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
But you say one more
word about that,

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and I will personally take you
away and have you arrested."

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Good.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Good for him.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:84%
But tunneling continues
in the whole Holy Basin,

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.380 align:middle line:90%
as we call it.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And I am actually in favor
of the tunneling, as long

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:84%
as we can get to
good archaeology

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and that it doesn't
disturb anybody,

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't disturb
either Muslim holy sites

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:90%
or Muslim neighborhoods.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: In fact, a new tunnel
was just opened a year ago,

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.690 align:middle line:84%
amidst a lot of continuing
controversy, a brand

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:90%
new tunnel.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Seeking for
the Ark of the Covenant?

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: This was different.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:36.850 align:middle line:84%
It all started back in 2004,
when to the south of the Temple

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Mount a sewer pipe had
burst, and the Israelis

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:84%
sent their engineers
to fix the pipes.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But again, this is sensitive
archaeological area,

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and the rule is,
you have to have

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:84%
competent archaeologists
who accompany

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.930 align:middle line:90%
any such civic endeavor.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And as the pipe
was being repaired,

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.530 align:middle line:84%
the archaeologists heard
some sounds underneath,

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:06.760 align:middle line:84%
sounded like metal was
striking stone underground

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.530 align:middle line:90%
as they were fixing this pipe.

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And they said, stop
it, hold everything.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And they began to
clear away the area,

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and they discovered a
series of ancient steps.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Steps going down?

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Steps.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:22.570 align:middle line:10%
Steps that were identical to
the steps leading right up

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.798 align:middle line:10%
to the south end of the
Temple Mount in antiquity.

00:31:25.798 --> 00:31:27.215 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: What's
the significance?

00:31:27.215 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: These are the
only types of steps--

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.450 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE: What's
the significance?

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:29.783 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: They looked identical.

00:31:29.783 --> 00:31:33.280 align:middle line:10%
The only types of steps like
this known anywhere in Israel.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there
must be more here.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And they began to
dig underground

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:41.140 align:middle line:84%
to uncover an entire
road of steps leading

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.760 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient pool of Siloam
right up to the south end

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:90%
of the Temple Mount.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:84%
The Pool of Siloam was
uncovered in all of this.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:53.020 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is a story
in the New Testament

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus of Nazareth
healed a man blind from birth

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.483 align:middle line:90%
at the Pool of Siloam.

00:32:00.483 --> 00:32:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right there.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.317 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Do you want
to know where Jesus was?

00:32:03.317 --> 00:32:04.330 align:middle line:90%
We've got it.

00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:07.750 align:middle line:84%
We've got an exact location
where he would have been,

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.340 align:middle line:90%
where he would have stood.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And this enormous road
of steps underground,

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.400 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing underground
with rows of ancient shops

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.130 align:middle line:84%
along the side, they call
it the Pilgrim's Road,

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.650 align:middle line:84%
because thousands of
ancient Israelites

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.650 align:middle line:84%
would have climbed those steps,
including Jesus of Nazareth,

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.110 align:middle line:84%
in the days of
the ancient temple

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.045 align:middle line:84%
to enter into the
sacred precincts.

00:32:28.045 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: That's fascinating.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.303 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: All of
this was underground,

00:32:30.303 --> 00:32:34.600 align:middle line:84%
but it had to be done
literally underneath

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:84%
modern Arab villages,
the village of Silwan.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Back in 1996, there
were three days of riots.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Sometimes "Banned
from Television"

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:52.110 align:middle line:10%
likes to expose our viewers
to video that is so bizarre,

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.070 align:middle line:10%
it begs to be seen
in its unedited form.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:10%
The West Bank in Israel.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.333 align:middle line:10%
Rioters throw Molotov cocktails.

00:32:59.333 --> 00:33:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What was
that all about?

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: 1996, the same
tunnel that Rabbi Getz had

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:84%
been working on,
along the same line

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.230 align:middle line:84%
the Western Wall, perpendicular
to that retaining wall,

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:16.610 align:middle line:84%
led all the way to the northern
precinct of the Temple Mount

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:17.900 align:middle line:90%
in antiquity.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, finally
in 1996, they completed it.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And the Israelis were able to
open an exit from that tunnel

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.648 align:middle line:90%
right onto the Via Dolorosa.

00:33:30.648 --> 00:33:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Now, who was rioting?

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:90%
The Palestinians?

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: When the tunnel was
opened, it immediately set off

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.470 align:middle line:84%
riots among the
Palestinian Arabs,

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.860 align:middle line:84%
because they were,
afraid, again that this

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.580 align:middle line:84%
was part of an Israeli plot
to open up that tunnel,

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.790 align:middle line:84%
go underneath, and blow
up the Dome of the Rock.

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Or, also, this
tunnel literally was

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.522 align:middle line:84%
right underneath the Muslim
Quarter of the Old City.

00:33:55.522 --> 00:33:56.980 align:middle line:84%
You have Muslim
residents up above.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are they
justified in being upset?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Actually, no.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one can understand,
it's a very incendiary topic

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:09.469 align:middle line:84%
and a very tense
area to live in.

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But really, there was no
danger to any of these areas.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.150 align:middle line:90%
The Israelis were so careful.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.400 align:middle line:84%
The last thing they
wanted was a cave-in.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.290 align:middle line:84%
But they did want
for tourists to be

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.780 align:middle line:84%
able to walk along that
tunnel and to witness

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that enormous 570 ton stone
ashlar along that tunnel

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and then to exit on the Via
Dolorosa, the traditional path

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.005 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus walked, which
actually is not the path.

00:34:31.005 --> 00:34:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you the real one.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Right.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: But they
did make the exit.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And immediately it set off
massive, massive rioting.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Within a couple of days, there
were 68 Arabs who were dead.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.255 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What quelled it?

00:34:45.255 --> 00:34:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Benjamin Netanyahu,
who was prime minister back

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:52.280 align:middle line:84%
then as well, had to call in
tanks and helicopter gunships

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.860 align:middle line:90%
just to quell the rioting.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.408 align:middle line:84%
And of course there
were casualties.

00:34:56.408 --> 00:34:57.950 align:middle line:84%
There were Israelis
who died as well.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, the majority
were Palestinians.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Sad.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: And that's how
archaeology meets geopolitics,

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.425 align:middle line:84%
sadly, in the
moderate Middle East.

00:35:06.425 --> 00:35:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Yeah,
it's too bad they

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.170 align:middle line:90%
can't all just get together.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.045 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Absolutely.

00:35:10.045 --> 00:35:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But that is the
vision of Judaism

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:84%
as well, that someday
a messianic king

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:84%
will come, and will
establish peace on earth.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe it?

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Judaism focuses not so
much on the hereafter,

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.290 align:middle line:84%
but on the here and
now, on the present.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And there really
is a firm belief

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.370 align:middle line:84%
that when the
Messiah comes, there

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:35.330 align:middle line:84%
will be peace on this earth,
and all peoples will come up

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:84%
in peace to study the holy
texts, the holy books,

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and to live in peace
and tranquility.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Ken, if we find
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and inside are the
Ten Commandments, what

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:52.940 align:middle line:84%
does this do to Christianity,
to Judaism, to Islam?

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.930 align:middle line:84%
The fact that it's discovered,
the Commandments are there,

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:01.160 align:middle line:84%
the stories from the
Bible are obviously true,

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.610 align:middle line:90%
what does that do?

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well,
actually, the great Rabbi

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:09.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Chabad-Lubavitch
ultra-orthodox movement, it's

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:10.970 align:middle line:84%
called Chabad today,
and it's all over

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:84%
the United States, the
late Rabbi Menachem Mendel

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Schneerson, spoke
personally to Rabbi Getz

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:20.420 align:middle line:84%
when he was about to
dig through the tunnel,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and look for the Ark,
and perhaps find it.

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And Rabbi Schneerson
said to Rabbi Getz, look,

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:26.960 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't do this.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Because you might be
placing your life in danger

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.320 align:middle line:90%
if you go ahead.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.680 align:middle line:84%
But then he followed, and
he said, but if you do,

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and if you find the
Ark of the Covenant,

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:84%
that is one step closer
to the final redemption.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is a belief
across Judaism.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:48.093 align:middle line:84%
That also propels some of the
modern folk, who are even today

00:36:48.093 --> 00:36:49.010 align:middle line:90%
searching for the Ark.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who is
searching for the Ark in a cave

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.670 align:middle line:84%
out in the middle of
the Judean Desert.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:56.840 align:middle line:90%
He thinks it's out there.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Where do
they get these leads?

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Well, there
is another text,

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:84%
an apocryphal book
called The Book

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.770 align:middle line:84%
of Maccabees, which
tells us that the Prophet

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah, before the Babylonian
conquest of the city in 586 BC,

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:15.443 align:middle line:84%
actually rescued the
Ark and brought it out

00:37:15.443 --> 00:37:17.360 align:middle line:84%
into the middle of the
desert, into the middle

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.820 align:middle line:84%
of the wilderness, and
hid it there in a cave,

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and sealed it until
the end of days.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.940 align:middle line:84%
That's in the Book
of Second Maccabees.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not in the Bible.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.940 align:middle line:90%
It's an apocryphal book.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: What do you believe?

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.170 align:middle line:90%
What do you believe?

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:31.962 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I don't put
a lot of stock in it,

00:37:31.962 --> 00:37:34.700 align:middle line:84%
but there have been people,
like my friend, my buddy who's

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.980 align:middle line:90%
out there near the Dead Sea.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.140 align:middle line:84%
He thinks the Dead
Sea Scrolls point

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to the exact location of
the cave where it's hidden.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I kind of doubt
it, but I think, look,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.280 align:middle line:84%
if you have the
wherewithal to dig, dig.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: Dig.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Dig.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: As long as
you're not destroying.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: As long as
you're not destroying.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.515 align:middle line:84%
And he has all
kinds of problems,

00:37:55.515 --> 00:37:57.307 align:middle line:84%
because the Israelis
don't want to give him

00:37:57.307 --> 00:37:59.300 align:middle line:84%
permission to go out
there and dig in the cave,

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.508 align:middle line:90%
where he thinks it's located.

00:38:00.508 --> 00:38:02.473 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Are they afraid
we're gonna find it?

00:38:02.473 --> 00:38:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: He thinks
that they are.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.150 align:middle line:90%
He thinks that they are.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I think probably they just don't
want more unauthorized digging,

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.360 align:middle line:84%
because he's not a certified
archaeologist and so on.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.400 align:middle line:90%
But who knows?

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.510 align:middle line:84%
He has friends in the
Israeli government,

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.420 align:middle line:84%
who would like to see him
go ahead and open this.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to see us go back
through the tunnel of Rabbi

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Getz and literally
go down there,

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and open up that
tunnel again and see.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:84%
But it would of course
cause more rioting.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.242 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Who do you think
had the best lead, Ken?

00:38:35.242 --> 00:38:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Getz?

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: I like Rabbi
Getz, personally.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Of course as a scholar--

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:39.792 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: You bet on him.

00:38:39.792 --> 00:38:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Scholars are trained
to be skeptical of everything,

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and the chances that
the Ark would actually

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:48.590 align:middle line:84%
have survived all this time,
from a scholarly standpoint,

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:50.270 align:middle line:90%
are minuscule.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But again, Rabbi Getz
said he saw something.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
he saw, but I'd sure

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:56.640 align:middle line:90%
like to find out what he saw.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.098 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: See, I've
got this vision

00:38:58.098 --> 00:38:59.630 align:middle line:84%
that some billionaire
on this planet

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.810 align:middle line:84%
already has the Ark in
his little home museum

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:03.980 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Stranger things have
happened, including the Dead

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Sea Scrolls, which were
bargained off, and sold off,

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and we still have stories of
people owning certain fragments

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:16.820 align:middle line:84%
of Dead Sea Scroll material
that they got themselves and are

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.740 align:middle line:84%
holding onto, and now want to
sell for millions of dollars,

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.250 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What keeps
driving you, Ken?

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:25.670 align:middle line:90%
What keeps pushing you?

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HANSON: Curiosity.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing that
drove me to the land of Israel

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.440 align:middle line:84%
to begin with as a
young history student.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.180 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't a theologian, per se.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to dig into
history and to archaeology,

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'd never been out
of the United States

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:90%
before in my life.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I just got on a plane
and headed to Jerusalem.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: I mean, I've
never interviewed someone

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:48.860 align:middle line:90%
with as much passion as you.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:49.970 align:middle line:90%
You really have it.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.553 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: It's easy
to get passionate.

00:39:51.553 --> 00:39:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
passionate, then why do it?

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Why do it?

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:39:55.650 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Why not get excited
about what you live for?

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's what keeps me going.

00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:04.908 align:middle line:84%
It keeps me as a professor,
as a writer, as an author.

00:40:04.908 --> 00:40:06.200 align:middle line:90%
That's why I wrote my new book.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even plan
to write this book.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:90%
It just came to me.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is a topic
that nobody has really

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.850 align:middle line:90%
dealt with before.

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down, and
I pounded it out.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Do you want
the Ark to be discovered?

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.200 align:middle line:10%
>>HANSON: No one would
be more happy in the--

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:10%
I would stand up and
dance right here and now,

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:26.150 align:middle line:10%
if we had a good lead on
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Again, the scholar in me is
doubtful, but questions linger.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:36.410 align:middle line:10%
The Prophet Jeremiah did detail
the various furniture items

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:38.720 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient temple
that was carted away

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.410 align:middle line:10%
into Babylonia at the time
of the ancient conquest.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:45.080 align:middle line:84%
The menorah, and
the table of the,

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.910 align:middle line:84%
showbread and so
on and so forth.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.955 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't mention the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:40:48.955 --> 00:40:49.755 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:40:49.755 --> 00:40:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGE: He would have.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: He would
have mentioned it.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.320 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it had already
been hidden away.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Why has it not appeared in
any other ancient document

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:04.430 align:middle line:84%
or record of any
kind whatsoever?

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.940 align:middle line:84%
These are the kind of
questions that linger.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.430 align:middle line:84%
The scholar is
doubtful, but hey,

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:13.960 align:middle line:84%
who would have believed that a
set of 2000-year-old parchments

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:84%
called the Dead
Sea Scrolls would

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.685 align:middle line:90%
have survived all of this time?

00:41:17.685 --> 00:41:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: Ken, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief".

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HANSON: Always a
pleasure, George.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE: What a
fascinating discussion.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Seeking the Ark of the Covenant.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Ark, a covenant, where
the Ten Commandments

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:84%
given from God to Moses may
very well still be there.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.360 align:middle line:10%
Fascinating if we ever find it.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief".

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:44.000 align:middle line:90%
