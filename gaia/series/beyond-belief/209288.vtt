How did you get

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.930 align:middle line:84%
involved in past
life regression?

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LINDA BACKMAN:
It's my life's work.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.700 align:middle line:84%
When we understand
ourself at a deeper level,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.970 align:middle line:84%
then we know who we are
and why we are here.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I have clients who
go to past lives.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:84%
If 10 clients have told me what
it's like to be an angelic soul

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and why they're here, there
must be some validity,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:84%
because those 10 people
don't know each other.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.225 align:middle line:84%
It's not a smooth
journey, but we

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:84%
need to be here doing
what we're doing.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we're the ones that are
going to change life on Earth.

Dr. Linda Backman back with us.

It's great to be here.

Thank you.

>>NOORY: How did
you get involved

00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:90%
in past life regression?

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN:
Surprisingly, in my 40s.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:10%
About-- now it's
almost 30 years ago--

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:10%
a very long story made short,
I had a colleague die at age 32

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:10%
from a type of lung cancer.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe in any
of this at that time.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:90%
I was about 46 years old.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:10%
And he started talking to
me from the other side.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:10%
He started showing me past
lives in my mind's eye.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Which I thought was
extremely weird,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:90%
and yet I was fascinated.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were you
convinced it was him?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:90%
I had no doubt.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's the feel.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:90%
I just had no doubt.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked my
husband what he thought

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:90%
about what I was experiencing.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And my husband said,
oh, when I was 10,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:90%
I remembered my past lives.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:90%
You never told me that before.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So that was permission,
George, for me to open up

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:90%
doors I never even considered.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going to be
a conventional psychologist

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:90%
the rest of my life.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad
you took this path?

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: More than glad.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:90%
It's my life's work.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
And I believe I was meant to
bring this information forward

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:90%
for people to understand.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You're devoted
to this, too, I can tell.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, it's my
heart, along with other people

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
in my life that are
my heart, but yes.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What have you learned
over the years about what this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.100 align:middle line:90%
all is?

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I've
certainly learned that we are

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:90%
much more than just this life.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to make it
simple, because it isn't really.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:90%
It isn't simple at all.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But I've learned that we as
humans, we as souls in body,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:84%
are here with purpose, and
that we must live our purpose.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
have to be big time.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
George and Linda doing

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:90%
a program like this.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
But it needs to be,
what are you guided

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to do because we affect
changes in humanity?

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda, what
is soul evolution?

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Soul evolution
is that, as a soul,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
we're required to grow
and learn and gain wisdom.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So as we move forward in our
lives, as we trip and fall--

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:90%
because we all trip and fall--

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.665 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're human.

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: We're human.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.510 align:middle line:90%
We're growing.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:90%
We're learning.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's not a smooth journey.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely a
jagged learning curve.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.967 align:middle line:84%
But we need to be
here doing what

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:84%
we're doing, because
we're the ones that are

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:90%
going to change life on Earth.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do you know
about your own soul evolution?

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
An individual, how
can we know this?

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: We see
signs all the time.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It's learning to acknowledge
and recognize those signs

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and believe they're
there for a reason.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:90%
My experience of having--

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very sad
that my colleague died--

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
but my experience of
sensing him and beginning

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
to see scenes of past lives,
I believe at my higher self

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:84%
level, at my soul
level, it was planned.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:90%
And then I made a choice.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it was
predetermined, in your opinion?

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: The opportunity
was predetermined.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:90%
The decision was mine.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We're never forced to make
a choice in that regard.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:90%
I was scared.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:90%
I thought, well, I'll never--

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:84%
my private practice will
just dry up and go away.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:90%
People will think I'm crazy.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:90%
That never happened.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It got
bigger and bigger.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It did.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:90%
It did.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's how we
know we're moving along

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:84%
the path that is the most useful
in terms of our soul's growth.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why is our soul's
growth so important?

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: This may sound overly
pie in the sky or esoteric,

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
but our souls'
growth is essential

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
because the higher
realm doesn't come down

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
here and effect change
and events and challenges.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
We effect change
in our human lives.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda, tell us
about the RavenHeart Center.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.177 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: The RavenHeart
Center is what I call my work.

00:05:01.177 --> 00:05:02.135 align:middle line:90%
It's the label of the--

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's your umbrella?

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's my umbrella.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.860 align:middle line:84%
The name RavenHeart
Center, simple story,

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.830 align:middle line:84%
came from soon after I started
having these experiences,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I went to a medium, a channel,
because I thought maybe

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:90%
I was making all this up.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And she told me that ravens
would start showing up

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:90%
in my life in odd ways.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:84%
A woman brought a wounded raven
to a workshop I was teaching

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and said, can the raven
be off in the corner?

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid it will die
if I don't care for it.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.892 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure, fine.

00:05:31.892 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And that's
how it started?

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many people
have gone through it?

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: George, I've
been guiding regression

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.760 align:middle line:84%
now since late '94, week in
and week out pretty much.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea how many.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't possibly count.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hundreds?

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Thousands?

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Thousands.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.130 align:middle line:84%
When they leave,
how do they leave?

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:90%
What happens to them?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: How do they
feel when they leave?

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hmm.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Better than
when they came in?

00:06:04.583 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
it's interesting.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
most of the time

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.760 align:middle line:84%
is that they gain a
lot of information,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:90%
and yet they need to process it.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So initially, I think
they're a little bit--

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
not overly surprised,
but a little surprised,

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and then they begin
to process it.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And I help them understand
how it fits into their life.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
between what I do--

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and I value a lot of capable
channels and mediums--

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I do the work that's
the reverse of being

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:90%
the channel or the medium.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I assist the client to do their
own, you might say, channeling.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
very helpful to them.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, it comes
through in a visceral way.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So it comes through them,
just like my experience

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:90%
came through me.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.200 align:middle line:90%
That's different.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And I have visited with
capable channels and mediums.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So I have no problem
with that whatsoever.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But when you experience
it yourself, the pictures,

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:06.170 align:middle line:84%
the emotions, the
life-changing information,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:90%
it's yours and only yours.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems to me
that ancient cultures have

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful understanding of all
of this-- reincarnation, soul

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:90%
evolution.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
How in the world
did they know this?

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I think that,
for one, ancient cultures,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe, were more trusting
of intuitive information.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And they hadn't become
so industrialized

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and mechanized and black
and white as we moved,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
we might say, beyond
the Crucifixion.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So they believed in
things that today we might

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:90%
call woo-woo or airy-fairy.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:90%
No question about it.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.378 align:middle line:84%
On "Gaia's Mystery
Teachings," we're

00:07:47.378 --> 00:07:49.170 align:middle line:84%
going to take a look
at some of the beliefs

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
around reincarnation,
Linda, taught by Pythagoras.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JONNY ENOCH: Even Pythagoras
taught his disciples

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:84%
about the teachings
of metempsychosis,

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.370 align:middle line:84%
or the passing of the soul
after death into another body.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:84%
He believed that it took
about 800 human incarnations

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:90%
to evolve ourselves.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:10%
Much like Buddha and Confucius,
having spent time in India,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:10%
he learned about the
noble doctrine of rebirth

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:10%
from the Brahmins.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras taught that the
idea about us being incarnated

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.260 align:middle line:84%
into animals actually relates to
us being born under our animal

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
signs from the Zodiac
as our souls travel here

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:90%
from the stars.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
This is not unlike the belief
of the ancient Chaldeans,

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.220 align:middle line:84%
of the Eleusinian
Mysteries, as I'm

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:84%
reminded of the roof at Hathor's
Temple, in Dendera, Egypt,

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:84%
where, when you look up, you
see beautiful illustrations

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:84%
of people in boats
traveling between the stars.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Heraclitus tells
us that Pythagoras

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.450 align:middle line:84%
could recall several
of his past lives,

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and shared them with
his loyal followers.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.940 align:middle line:84%
At other times, he helped them
remember their past lives,

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
such was the case of
one of his disciples

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Malias of Cortona,
who remembered

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
that he had been the Phrygian
King Midas, who is forever

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:84%
remembered by Greek mythology
as turning everything

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:90%
he touched to gold.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's Jonny Enoch.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.860 align:middle line:90%
Interesting scenarios there.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Very much so.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ancient cultures.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And again, their wisdom
was outstanding, wasn't it?

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I think a piece
of the fascination of ancient

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.040 align:middle line:84%
cultures is that
some of those souls--

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:84%
this comes through
in regressions

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:84%
that I guide-- some of
the souls of ancient times

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:90%
are continuing to incarnate.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So some of those souls
are everyday people.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
But some of those souls are
key people in our current life.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:84%
One that I've uncovered
through regression

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:90%
is the soul of Moses.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:90%
That soul was into nonviolence.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Through numerous
regressions, I have learned--

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is where I
look for, you might say,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:90%
corroboration of evidence--

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
that the soul of Gandhi
is the soul of Moses,

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.260 align:middle line:90%
teaching the same non--

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.023 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A reincarnated soul?

00:10:06.023 --> 00:10:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And
that soul continues

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.653 align:middle line:90%
to incarnate to this day.

00:10:08.653 --> 00:10:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find
that, historically,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:90%
the cultures of the past--

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Egyptians, Tibetans, Hebrews--
were similar or different

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.440 align:middle line:90%
in their belief systems on this?

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: They were similar.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I've learned about some
of the earliest cultures.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, those-- we might
call them soul groups--

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:90%
continue to incarnate today.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:84%
The Babylonians, the Egyptians,
the culture in the northern--

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:84%
the Indus River Valley,
between India and Pakistan--

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.960 align:middle line:90%
early culture.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And those souls continue
to evolve and come

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:90%
into our world of today.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Years ago, I was
fascinated with the belief

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:90%
of the Tibetans, for example.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
They wrote a book called "The
Tibetan Book of the Dead."

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians have one,
called "The Egyptian Book

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:90%
of the Dead."

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.060 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a playbook,
or a guide, for the other side.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't we
have one of those books?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I think
for various reasons.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the reasons we
don't have one of those books

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:84%
is, one, because I think
as modern day people,

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Westernized people, again,
we became, in my opinion,

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
more focused on capitalism
and industrialism.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
of us, including

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.435 align:middle line:84%
people that talk about things
that you and I are discussing--

00:11:27.435 --> 00:11:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: --that need to be
expanded and brought back.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes
us into a deeper

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:84%
place of understanding
these ancient beliefs

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.680 align:middle line:90%
that are still valid.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's probably one
of the most important facets

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:90%
of living--

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and that's to understand the
evolution of the soul, I think.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.730 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.313 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I mean,
simply put, I think

00:11:49.313 --> 00:11:51.645 align:middle line:84%
that's the only
reason we're here.

00:11:51.645 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:84%
The way we grow and evolve
is lifetime to lifetime.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:90%
And we don't primarily--

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:84%
as I answer things, I'm speaking
from listening to clients,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.680 align:middle line:84%
week in and week out--
so the only way we evolve

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:84%
is to come into these
bodies, these human bodies,

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and grow and evolve through
learning and making choices,

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and maybe revamping
those choices.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:90%
But yes, that's why we're here.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Spiritually
speaking, Linda,

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:90%
the souls have incarnated.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:90%
How did this all happen?

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:90%
How did this start--

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:90%
the evolution of the soul?

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, my
understanding, George,

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.170 align:middle line:84%
about that is that
when Earth began

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
to have intelligent life,
intelligent incarnation

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:84%
of souls that were beyond the
primitive level of living,

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
when civilization
began to occur,

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:84%
my understanding is that there
was an original large soul

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:90%
group.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.073 align:middle line:84%
I've been given a name for
it-- there are probably

00:12:49.073 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
different names for it, but
the name I've been given

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.807 align:middle line:90%
is the Melchizedek Soul Group.

00:12:52.807 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Melchizedeks, OK.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:90%
And we've heard of Melchizedek.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: We can talk about--

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Melchizedek is believed
to be the soul that

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.800 align:middle line:84%
was in and out of body during
the time of the development

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:90%
of the city of Jerusalem.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that soul group was
mandated to come from somewhere

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:84%
else in the universe-- we might
call that soul group a star

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:90%
seed soul group--

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I often call it interplanetary--
that soul group came to Earth

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and began to work,
lifetime to a lifetime,

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:90%
to evolve our culture.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who sent
those souls to us--

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.175 align:middle line:90%
God?

00:13:26.175 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Well, yes.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But then that begs
the question--

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
I think an important question
is-- who or what is God?

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a good question.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think
it's a crucial question

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:90%
that so many people ask.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So my understanding-- and I
say it that way all the time,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
because I'm piecing together
what I learn from clients--

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: What we call
God, the Dao, the Source,

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:90%
whatever term fits for people--

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is the divine power,
the higher source,

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.650 align:middle line:84%
that seeks to assist
humanity to evolve.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Its a-- we might
call it a god force--

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:90%
focused on Earth.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is that
that's a group soul.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
That the bulk of those souls
that make up that group

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:84%
never came to Earth,
save one of those souls--

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.790 align:middle line:90%
except for one of those souls.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
divine forces.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So divine forces work
with divine forces,

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.400 align:middle line:84%
originally to bring this
star seed group to Earth,

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:84%
called the Melchizedek
Soul Group.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Many people believe
that it is the 144,000

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.100 align:middle line:84%
souls that is talked about in
the Old and New Testaments.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The taken ones, right?

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I don't know that
I've heard that term before

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:41.980 align:middle line:90%
for--

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I heard that there
were 144,000 souls that

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:90%
were just taken.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And so I assume
what that might mean

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:90%
is taken from somewhere else?

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And delivered
somewhere else.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: OK, that
makes complete sense.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And delivered here to begin
incarnating-- obviously,

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years ago,
tens of thousands of years

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:84%
ago-- to begin working
to move humanity forward.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing, isn't it?

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
the possibilities

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and the complexity
of all this, it's

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:84%
remarkable, amazing, and
puzzling at the same time.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:90%
And what I think--

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
amazing is one word
we can call it--

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:84%
but what I think is amazing
is that we are still

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:90%
working on that.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.610 align:middle line:84%
That humans, in body,
are still working

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
on evolving us beyond
self-absorption,

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.490 align:middle line:90%
beyond power and control.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:84%
We're still working to find
a place of healthier culture

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.060 align:middle line:90%
in many parts of our planet.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, you
have said a couple

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:90%
of times-- you've been told.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:90%
By whom?

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: By clients.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
There's not some
divine power that

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:84%
comes to you in the middle
of the night and goes,

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Linda, this is what a soul is--

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't happen?

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Aha.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.518 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe it does.

00:16:07.518 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I think--

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.450 align:middle line:84%
yes-- because I think
it's crucial for any of us

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:90%
to develop our intuition.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.787 align:middle line:84%
We're all capable of
intuitive receiving.

00:16:18.787 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I say this
to clients all the time.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like you can intuitively
connect with your own higher

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:84%
self, your soul energy that
does not come into body.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:84%
You can connect with
your spiritual guides

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:90%
and your own higher self.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:84%
You just have to believe and
work to develop that ability.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.390 align:middle line:90%
So yes, I have--

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
years ago, I never thought
I could do that, but I do.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, intuitive download
comes to me at times.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda, what does the
angelic realm mean to you?

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: The angelic realm--

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.200 align:middle line:84%
again, this comes
through regression

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So there is a--
you might call it

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:84%
a cadre of souls that serve the
divine energy that does what

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.930 align:middle line:90%
they can to coordinate Earth.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:90%
That is the angelic realm.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do they live among us?

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, they incarnate.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:90%
That's how I know about them.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Because I have
clients who are angelic souls.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't always act in an
angelic manner necessarily.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But the role of the angelic
realm is to support the divine

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and is to bring what you
would call love and compassion

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:90%
energy to the Earth.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I work with different clients
almost week in and week out.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't give them
the information--

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:90%
they give me the information.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taught
through my clients.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
a facilitator?

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.385 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Completely.

00:17:47.385 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:84%
My analogy is, I'm the driver
of the bus in a regression,

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
but the itinerary
of the bus is not

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:84%
something I even know when
I start the regression.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So I have clients
who go to past lives,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and then connect to
their soul level.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to tell
me where they come from.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
They begin to tell me what
the angelic realm is about.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And then I begin
to piece together--

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a
psychologist, I'm trained

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:84%
in scientific method-- that was
a requirement in my training

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So I look for where's
the corroboration?

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And if 10 clients have
told me about what

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.100 align:middle line:84%
it's like to be an angelic
soul and why they're here,

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.672 align:middle line:84%
there must be some
validity, because those 10

00:18:33.672 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:90%
people don't know each other.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Some of the evidence
left behind for us

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:90%
are in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.020 align:middle line:84%
William Henry, on
Gaia's "Deep Space,"

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.738 align:middle line:84%
talked about these
uncovered scrolls.

00:18:45.738 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
The Dead Sea Scrolls

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
are the books written
by Jewish mystics who

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:90%
called themselves the Essenes.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
These were individuals
who claimed

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.280 align:middle line:84%
they were living
with angels and had

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
received teachings about
human transformation

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:90%
into celestial beings.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Their texts were stashed away
when Rome invaded Palestine

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:90%
in 70 AD, hidden away in caves.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were discovered,
surreptitiously, in 1947,

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and caused a worldwide
sensation upon their discovery.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:84%
They are essentially
Gnostic in nature,

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
because the Essenes
themselves were Gnostics.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
They were interested
in self-realization

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and the perfection of the
human body, the transformation

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of the body into a celestial
form or a light body form.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
The Dead Sea Scrolls are
not labeled Gnostic texts,

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:84%
as are the Nag Hammadi
Library, but the core of them,

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the heart of them,
is Gnostic in nature.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.630 align:middle line:10%
When we read the
Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:10%
it becomes very clear that the
Essenes, these Jewish mystics,

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:10%
Gnostic mystics, were
having close encounters

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:10%
of the first, second,
third, and fourth kind.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:84%
They said they
were seeing angels.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:84%
They were seeing
things in the sky.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Portals were opening in the sky.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, they
also had close encounters

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.790 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth, sixth,
seventh, and eighth kind.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
The close encounter
of the eighth kind

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.550 align:middle line:84%
is human transformation
into a celestial being.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.240 align:middle line:84%
The Dead Sea Scrolls clearly
describes humans being taken--

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.863 align:middle line:84%
possibly abducted in
a modern conversation,

00:20:17.863 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't think
of it as abduction

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
then-- they're taken
into the celestial realms

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and transformed into
an extraterrestrial,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:84%
or celestial, being by
angels, who themselves

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:90%
were extraterrestrials.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So the Dead Sea
Scrolls are actually

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:90%
a first moment of disclosure--

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.030 align:middle line:90%
is what they are.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's amazing
what the ancients knew,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:84%
just by what William
was talking about.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to have these encounters
and to see what they saw,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
what a time period
this must have been.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.705 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So George,
I think that, if I can,

00:20:52.705 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:90%
I can backfill a little bit.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.835 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: But William
Henry, I'm sure,

00:20:56.835 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
has more knowledge than
just the minimal amount

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:90%
he's speaking about.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:10%
So back in the day, of the time
of the one we called Jesus--

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:10%
and of course, that soul
was not named Jesus--

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:10%
that's a Greek word
given to that soul after

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:10%
the Crucifixion--
but when that soul,

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:10%
whose name was Yeshua ben-Yosef,
Yeshua, son of Joseph,

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:10%
that soul was trained at the
Essene village at the top

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:10%
of Mount Carmel in what
today is the city of Haifa--

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:24.980 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And so
when Jesus, Yeshua,

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:84%
was trained at about
age 13, he studied

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:84%
in that Essene village that was
teaching what William Henry is

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:90%
speaking about.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.758 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What great
knowledge you possess, Linda.

00:21:37.758 --> 00:21:38.925 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It's fascinating.

00:21:38.925 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Truly, it really is.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Totally fascinating.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: My mother
once told me about God.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.920 align:middle line:90%
She said, Georgie--

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:90%
I was a little kid--

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:84%
God always was and
always will be.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Mom, I need a
better answer than that.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:90%
I must have been six years old.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And she kept saying, always
was and always will be.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:90%
What did she mean by that?

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, that there's
a divine force that is eternal.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.775 align:middle line:90%
There's a divine force that--

00:22:06.775 --> 00:22:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and here's where
I think it becomes

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.060 align:middle line:84%
complicated-- that there is and
always has been a divine force.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.640 align:middle line:84%
We're being, in my
opinion, pushed,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:23.360 align:middle line:84%
as souls that embody, to gain
wisdom, to, we might say,

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:84%
elevate to the place
of understanding--

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:90%
divine source.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, we
have to grow and evolve.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like learning
our ABCs ourselves

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
or learning how to-- you get
the spelling words on Monday,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and by Friday you have to know
how to spell them correctly

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:90%
to pass the spelling test.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:84%
We're working on
the spelling test

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
that the divine would
want us to work on,

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and we've not reached
Friday and having learned

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.335 align:middle line:90%
what we needed to learn.

00:22:52.335 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've talked with
past life regressionists,

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:84%
much like you, Linda,
who have talked

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:84%
about how people bring with them
phobias from their past lives.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And that, in regression,
they're able to deal with it,

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and it makes them OK
in their human life.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.553 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:23:10.553 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think
the overriding answer

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:84%
to that is all of us have what
I call past life bleed through.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, relationships,
phobias-- phobias--

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Illnesses, whatever.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Health
issues, exactly.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Things that we
think we shouldn't

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
do because it's
dangerous because there

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:90%
was danger in a past life.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And once we understand
it, it either lessens

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:84%
or it fully goes away,
because there's explanation.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:43.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important are
past lives to our current life?

00:23:43.195 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: They're crucial.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
say they're crucial

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:84%
is because of that's
the way the soul grows.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So if we understand either what
useful choices we made that we

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:56.932 align:middle line:84%
don't realize we've
already made--

00:23:56.932 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that's what you
would call dharma--

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
that means, what did we
gain or learn in a past life

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:84%
that we don't give
ourselves credit for--

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:09.490 align:middle line:84%
or what's karma-- what
choices did we make?

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:84%
We all have free will when we
come into these human bodies.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:84%
What choices did we make
that weren't the most useful?

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Then we can balance
them in life today.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the soul
evolves, lifetime to lifetime,

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.400 align:middle line:90%
in a choppy manner.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What does it
mean to have a soul pod?

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So as a soul,
when our soul is new,

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.580 align:middle line:84%
when our soul is ready
to begin incarnation--

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and I'll just add,
there's preparation before

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:84%
incarnation-- we might
call it the soul nursery--

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:84%
but a soul pod means we
belong to a group of souls.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And those are the souls--
almost like soul homeroom--

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:84%
who are those souls in
our original neighborhood

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
that we worked with before
we came into body, that we

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.650 align:middle line:90%
continue to encounter?

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:54.715 align:middle line:90%
They're our best friends.

00:24:54.715 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Over and over again.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And sometimes just
multiple, multiple times.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's magical
almost, isn't it?

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Well, it reminds
me-- it's a simple example,

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:10%
but I have an adult son
who's very much an adult,

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:10%
in his early 50s--

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:10%
and at times he acts
a bit like my parent.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:10%
But I know he's been my parent.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.750 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: In a past life?

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: In a past life.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:90%
And so I accept that.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he isn't always
like that with me.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
But I know we've shared
many lives in many ways.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to be our child.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.360 align:middle line:90%
It could be our neighbor.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.990 align:middle line:84%
It could be our mentor
that we've known before.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.763 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's remarkable.

00:25:33.763 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It's fascinating.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.850 align:middle line:84%
It explains
relationships in ways

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't be explained.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why can't we all
remember our past lives?

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have to do
it under hypnotherapy?

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, two
answers to that, George.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:84%
First of all, people have more
awareness of their past lives

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.570 align:middle line:84%
if they know how to look for
signs of their past lives.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So I often help
people with that.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:90%
But the second, and maybe--

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:84%
probably more
crucial-- answer is

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:84%
because we have to keep pulling
back the curtain ourselves.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Pulling back the
curtain means we're

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:90%
working on our own evolution.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Coming upon someone in our life
that we don't get along with,

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:84%
or there's some
oppositional relationship,

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.890 align:middle line:90%
may relate to a past life.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:21.620 align:middle line:90%
And we need to clean it up.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.660 align:middle line:90%
And if we knew all the details--

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:84%
like that soul harmed
me in a past life--

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:84%
we might not continue
the relationship

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.920 align:middle line:84%
in order to balance
the soul relationship.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matias De
Stefano, on his show

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:84%
"Journey of
Remembering," for Gaia,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.500 align:middle line:90%
talks about his own past life.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:10%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: So
when I was 11, 12 years old,

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:10%
I started to remember my lives.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And all the emotion was the only
way in which I could remember.

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:90%
It was not like information.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.270 align:middle line:84%
It was emotion of all the
beings, all the people,

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that I have been and
that I have been with.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.950 align:middle line:84%
My family was
agnostic, so they had

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:90%
no idea about spiritual things.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:90%
But they were creative.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:90%
My mom was creative.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So she loved to listen
to what I was saying.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Like if I was just having
a lot of imagination.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I had no idea how
to handle that imagination.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.810 align:middle line:84%
But of course, I thought many
times I was getting crazy,

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:84%
until I started to find many
others that also remembered.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a
child, I had no idea

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.200 align:middle line:84%
about what I was doing,
why I was doing this.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And they told me, in a few
years, when it will be 2012,

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
you have to connect and talk
with many people in the world,

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:90%
and your mission will start.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
ready for that moment.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed to
be 24 years old in 2012.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I
don't know how I'm

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:07.280 align:middle line:84%
going to do anything that you
are saying, because I don't

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:90%
know how to speak with people.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.790 align:middle line:90%
I really was afraid of people.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really want to be in
touch with the spiritual world.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Along the years, I started
to accept my nature--

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.190 align:middle line:90%
like being this weird person.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I never was afraid of saying
what was happening to me.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.140 align:middle line:84%
I was always sharing with my mom
mostly, my friends, everything

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that I was remembering,
everything that I was feeling.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to become
a teacher so I

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:43.730 align:middle line:10%
could help others like me that
were coming to this world,

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.770 align:middle line:10%
to have an idea of
how to survive here,

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:48.000 align:middle line:10%
and to learn how to
live in this world,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.473 align:middle line:10%
and not to forget, and to
be balanced in this reality.

00:28:53.473 --> 00:28:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He seems to
have a pretty good handle

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.830 align:middle line:90%
on his past lives.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Though I don't know for sure,
because I've certainly not

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:90%
regressed Matias De Stefano.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I know about his work,
and it's powerful.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And he could well be a soul
that perhaps doesn't regularly

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.600 align:middle line:84%
come to Earth, but comes
from somewhere else.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And is what
I've been taught to call--

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know for sure, so I--

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where could
that somewhere else be?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
usually-- so again,

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I work with many
clients who are souls,

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that their soul-- we
might say their soul

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.930 align:middle line:84%
is designed not
to come to Earth,

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.350 align:middle line:84%
but to operate in
evolved cultures

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:90%
somewhere else in the universe.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Other
planetary systems?

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Planets, star
systems, inter-dimensional--

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wormholes?

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Wormholes.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.143 align:middle line:90%
I have clients on spacecraft.

00:29:48.143 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I would
have thought that was

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.400 align:middle line:90%
the craziest thing possible.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not anymore.

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: But the details are
way too specific to be made up.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And so some of these
souls that I've

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.190 align:middle line:84%
been taught to
call interplanetary

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.430 align:middle line:84%
are souls coming from
advanced cultures,

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:11.740 align:middle line:84%
usually within the solar
system that contains Earth.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Usually not from outside
of our solar system,

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.090 align:middle line:90%
yet that's possible.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But they bring advanced wisdom
and knowledge, advanced--

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:90%
like Matias--

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:84%
with this almost automatic
intuitive ability.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:90%
We need their wisdom.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This higher self
that we are striving for,

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.375 align:middle line:10%
does that make it easier
to remember past lives?

00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, when we're
remembering past lives,

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.824 align:middle line:90%
we're tapping into the--

00:30:40.824 --> 00:30:45.040 align:middle line:84%
you might say-- the archives
held within our soul energy.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And our soul energy
is our higher self.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So when I guide a
client in a regression,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.540 align:middle line:84%
basically, that's
where they're going.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.360 align:middle line:84%
They're connecting
to their own soul

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.972 align:middle line:84%
and tapping into those
memories, that content.

00:30:58.972 --> 00:31:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have you
ever had somebody

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:84%
in a past life
regression completely

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.702 align:middle line:90%
break down emotionally?

00:31:04.702 --> 00:31:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
I've certainly had

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.740 align:middle line:90%
people have strong emotions.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Have they broken down and
can't regain their foundation

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:90%
and their groundedness?

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:84%
But at times, they
break down with purpose.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.600 align:middle line:10%
Because they need to
release something.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
breakdown is about.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they regain their
composure, their solid nature,

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.530 align:middle line:84%
that they had before
the regression.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How important is
free will with all of this?

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: It's key.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:84%
We see it on the
Earth all the time.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.950 align:middle line:84%
We see people making
incredibly useful choices.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:47.640 align:middle line:84%
We see people making
absolutely heinous, horrific,

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:84%
nonfunctional,
dysfunctional choices.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So when we're making
useful choices,

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.190 align:middle line:84%
then we're following
our guidance.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:84%
When we're making heinous,
non-humanitarian choices,

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.270 align:middle line:84%
then we are absolutely not
following our guidance.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:07.230 align:middle line:84%
We're following our human
self, our human ego, our power

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:90%
and control needs.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And we sometimes see
those heinous things

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.140 align:middle line:84%
done around the planet
all the time, don't we?

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Absolutely.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Free will,
where does that come in?

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, free will is an
aspect of incarnating on Earth.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:84%
My understanding is it is
the unique quality that

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:30.560 align:middle line:84%
was determined pre-incarnation,
before souls came to Earth.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And that free
will was going to be--

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I hate to call it the test--

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.650 align:middle line:84%
but it was going
to be the option

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:44.140 align:middle line:84%
that we as humans can choose
to demonstrate how we evolve.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.980 align:middle line:90%
We're still working on that.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.260 align:middle line:90%
We are still--

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have a
lot of advanced souls

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and advanced choices
happening through free will.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.458 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is free will important?

00:32:54.458 --> 00:32:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Again, it's crucial.

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Because if we don't use--

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.270 align:middle line:84%
we might say--
soul-based free will--

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:04.960 align:middle line:84%
or another way would be to
call it healthy free will--

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:84%
then we're making
self-absorbed free will choices

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.110 align:middle line:90%
that only suit our own needs.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would concoct
this brilliant scheme,

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.990 align:middle line:90%
this divine intelligence?

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:18.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's truly remarkable.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:84%
When you start listening
to every facet of what

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:26.540 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about, Linda,
it's brilliant, isn't it?

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: It's
completely brilliant.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to slip into our human
selves and lose track of it.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, if you
like ice cream, great.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Eat it on occasion.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.940 align:middle line:84%
But don't eat it
three meals a day.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.700 align:middle line:90%
So we can slip into that.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Joy and pleasure is essential.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I have lots of clients
whose guides will speak

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.370 align:middle line:90%
to them during the regression.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And the guides will
say, take time for fun.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Take time for play.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Lighten up.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:00.450 align:middle line:90%
I've heard that so many times.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:04.940 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, looking
at higher order, higher wisdom,

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:84%
is the only way that we
can use our free will

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:08.552 align:middle line:90%
to evolve humanity.

00:34:08.552 --> 00:34:10.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think everybody
should have some past life

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.280 align:middle line:84%
regression, just to
see who they were

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.020 align:middle line:90%
and what they were in the past?

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: If I truly answer
that honestly-- which I will--

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.310 align:middle line:90%
the answer is yes.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.969 align:middle line:84%
Because then we give our
guides, our spiritual guides--

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:24.770 align:middle line:90%
we all have spiritual guides--

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:84%
we give our guides
the opportunity

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%
to bring forward
something we need

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.969 align:middle line:84%
to know about that will
assist us as an individual

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and, again, will
assist humanity.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are some people
are afraid to find out

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:90%
about their past lives?

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:84%
There are people who will
say, well, I'm worried that--

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.635 align:middle line:84%
I've heard this so many
times, and it's never

00:34:44.635 --> 00:34:46.760 align:middle line:84%
happened-- they'll say,
well, I don't want to learn

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.560 align:middle line:90%
that I was an axe murderer.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.224 align:middle line:84%
I have never regressed
an axe murderer.

00:34:51.224 --> 00:34:52.024 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yet.

00:34:52.024 --> 00:34:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Yet.

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yet.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's true.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I think if we allow
that curtain to be pulled back,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.350 align:middle line:84%
that window to open
onto who we were,

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.900 align:middle line:84%
then we allow our learning
to grow and expand.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been one of
the most fascinating aspects

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.750 align:middle line:84%
of regression that you've
encountered with an individual?

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us a story?

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Oh, so many.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No names needed.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, absolutely,
I will not use names.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll share
about angelic souls.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
probably the newest--

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I might say-- avenue
that my guides must

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.900 align:middle line:84%
have decided I needed
to know about so I

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.850 align:middle line:90%
could help other angelic souls.

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.190 align:middle line:90%
My work, I see as therapeutic.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.170 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a therapist at heart.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I have been for
a very long time.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So I began to work
with clients--

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.470 align:middle line:84%
certainly, not every week-- but
I began to work with clients.

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And once they completed the past
life, during the regression,

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and they began to follow
that natural journey,

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:84%
as the soul leaves the
body-- the body is no longer

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.750 align:middle line:84%
functioning, the
past-life body--

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and we follow the soul's journey
to reconnect to the higher

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And that is the type of
regression that I guide.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I started having a number
of clients talk about wings.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that's interesting--

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like angelic wings?

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: They began to
say, as I'm crossing over,

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm experiencing either wings
on-- that their own soul

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:84%
energy, as it was elevating,
returning, we would say,

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:28.410 align:middle line:90%
to fifth dimension and beyond--

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.620 align:middle line:84%
which is what happens
in the regression--

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:35.120 align:middle line:84%
they would either say they
were sensing having wings,

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.230 align:middle line:90%
as a soul--

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:84%
their own soul-- or
at times, their guides

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.840 align:middle line:90%
would show up with wings.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.280 align:middle line:90%
And that was new for me.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So that to me is like going
down-- following the path--

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:49.940 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And as I kept having
clients telling me

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:55.580 align:middle line:84%
these similar kinds
of things, I began

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.190 align:middle line:84%
to ask more questions
during the regression,

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:00.770 align:middle line:84%
as open ended as I
could ask questions,

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:84%
discovering that
some of these clients

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.783 align:middle line:84%
were souls from
the angelic realm.

00:37:05.783 --> 00:37:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It truly is.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Are we partners in the
process of human evolution

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:15.110 align:middle line:90%
with other beings and entities?

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, for sure.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.720 align:middle line:84%
We are partners with each
other, of course, on Earth.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.300 align:middle line:84%
But we're partners with
souls from the higher realm,

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.410 align:middle line:90%
from the celestial realm.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So simply put, my
understanding is

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:90%
there are three types of souls.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:84%
There are souls designed
to incarnate mostly--

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.580 align:middle line:90%
primarily-- on Earth.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:84%
There are souls designed
to come from somewhere

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.850 align:middle line:90%
else in the celestial realm.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are souls designed
to be angelic souls.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.340 align:middle line:84%
They are three
different-- you might

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:48.570 align:middle line:84%
say-- types of souls or
types of different origin.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matias
is with us again,

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.280 align:middle line:84%
talking about human beings
on Earth and their roles.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's watch him.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DE STEFANO: The
being, when it's born,

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:02.810 align:middle line:84%
creates something called a new
map of matrix, where you have

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Mars, the Moon, Jupiter,
Saturn, the Sun, which

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.690 align:middle line:90%
is your astrological chart.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the design of
your personality,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:16.370 align:middle line:90%
the design of who you are here.

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't condition
you to be who you are.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a tool.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a tool of the
spirit, in order

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.810 align:middle line:84%
to help you to do what
you are doing here.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we say we
are doing it wrong.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd rather
be like that person

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.745 align:middle line:90%
that lives this and that.

00:38:36.745 --> 00:38:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And we don't pay attention
to the good things

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.000 align:middle line:90%
that we have in our tools.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.300 align:middle line:84%
That maybe the bad things
that we usually have

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.430 align:middle line:84%
is because we are not
using it properly.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:50.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a
hammer and doing this.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.900 align:middle line:84%
If you learn what
is a hammer for,

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.760 align:middle line:90%
maybe you will build a house.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.430 align:middle line:90%


00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So knowing yourself, knowing
yourself and your personality

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and your emotions and your
background of every past life

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and everything that happens
to you, in the whole creation,

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:84%
it helps you to
understand who you are.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And once you
accomplish that, you

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:19.960 align:middle line:84%
become a node of a group of
people that will do the same.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the group of
people becomes a culture.

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And the culture
becomes a species.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And the species
becomes a planet.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:28.660 align:middle line:90%
And the planet becomes a system.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And the system, an
arm of the galaxy.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.730 align:middle line:90%
And then a galaxy.

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And then the universe.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you are able
to go to what you are,

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:49.090 align:middle line:84%
suddenly you are able to
help the entire universe.

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Straight.

00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's why going within
is helping without--

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.390 align:middle line:90%
outside.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the next
step with all of this, Linda?

00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.810 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:02.460 align:middle line:90%
Where do you take what you do?

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I think,
again, as we watch Matias--

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and I recently had
a client of mine,

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.550 align:middle line:84%
who is an interplanetary
soul-- we learned this

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.800 align:middle line:84%
through regression-- she
wrote to me and she said,

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Linda, have you watched
Matias De Stefano?

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.585 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
we're speaking about this.

00:40:17.585 --> 00:40:18.385 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure

00:40:18.385 --> 00:40:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And she said, he
talks about things that you

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.100 align:middle line:90%
talk about--

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.880 align:middle line:90%
and other things as well.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So I think the goal is
exactly what Matias is saying,

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and it is also the
purpose of regression--

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.560 align:middle line:84%
that when we understand
ourselves at a deeper level,

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:38.670 align:middle line:84%
then we know who we are and
why we are here at this time.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And that allows us to follow
our natural journey that

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.430 align:middle line:84%
was both preplanned
before we came into body

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:48.740 align:middle line:90%
and is also planned on the fly--

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.420 align:middle line:90%
is planned as we're living.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And then what Matias
is talking about

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.820 align:middle line:84%
is so interrelated
to regression.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Because then we understand
how to keep moving forward

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.330 align:middle line:84%
in our current life,
evolving as we go,

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and contributing to
greater evolution.

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
hope for humanity,

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.640 align:middle line:84%
when you look at
things that we've

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.330 align:middle line:90%
been talking about tonight?

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think there's
absolutely hope for humanity.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:19.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm a glass half full person,
not a glass half empty person.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:19.880 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Partly sunny,
not partly cloudy, right?

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.300 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: I think that's
crucial to be sure--

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.060 align:middle line:10%
as you say-- to say, yes,
today is partly sunny,

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:32.210 align:middle line:10%
not-- although our weather
people say partly cloudy.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.850 align:middle line:10%
But if we look around
the world and we

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.970 align:middle line:10%
look at various world leaders--

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:40.190 align:middle line:10%
and there are leaders
in all ways, not just

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.120 align:middle line:10%
political leaders-- but we
have some pretty savvy world

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.020 align:middle line:10%
leaders.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:50.240 align:middle line:10%
The question is, will we come
together and find commonality,

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:56.010 align:middle line:10%
rather than allowing our,
again, personal needs to--

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:58.233 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's the
$64,000 question.

00:41:58.233 --> 00:41:59.150 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Completely.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Linda, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.118 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: My pleasure.

00:42:02.118 --> 00:42:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.870 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: The life of a
past life regressionist,

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:09.950 align:middle line:10%
helping people solve
their problems of today

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.350 align:middle line:10%
from things that
happened in the past.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.970 align:middle line:90%
It's truly remarkable.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:14.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:22.000 align:middle line:90%
