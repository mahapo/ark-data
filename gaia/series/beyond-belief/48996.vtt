00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.682 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.230 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.240 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:26.519 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:10%
How would you like to wake
up in the dead of night,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:10%
and have some
creature, some entity,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.424 align:middle line:10%
standing at the
foot of your bed?

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's what
happened to the author

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:10%
of Alien Scriptures,
Michael Carter.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, it scared the
living daylights out of you.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL CARTER: Yeah.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.765 align:middle line:84%
And I told you, I
still sleep with--

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:48.739 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One eye open?

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Well, with the
light on 'til the last minute.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.863 align:middle line:10%
But again, now it's not
so much because this

00:00:52.863 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:10%
has been over years.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:10%
It's just to wake up,
and there's-- my windows,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:10%
my doors are locked-- I'm home,
and to see someone else there.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.279 align:middle line:10%
At the beginning, it used to
be paralysis, where I could--

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:09.070 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which is
another horrible feeling.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yes.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And the more I panicked,
the worse things got.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:90%
And then it just stopped.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether the
paralysis was to protect them

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:90%
from me, or whatever it was.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:90%
And things kind of progressed.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was
just the jarring

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:84%
of seeing another
individual-- because they

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.720 align:middle line:90%
are individuals-- in my room.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
But they started me on this
journey-- the Bible, just

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:84%
getting into that, just
reading it in a different way.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I mean, the Bible's
an interesting book,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
because we've used it
for so many things.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:10%
We've used it to
condone slavery.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:10%
We've used it to keep women
oppressed or marginalized.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:10%
We've used it to keep
gay brothers and sisters

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.479 align:middle line:10%
marginalized and oppressed.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's also been
an uplifting book.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So we can use the Bible
in any way we want.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
But if I just look at it--
for instance, in Isaiah 40,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:84%
chapter 40, verse 22, it says--
and Isaiah is writing, what,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.530 align:middle line:84%
4,500-5,000 years ago-- that it
is he who sits above the sphere

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:84%
of the earth and its inhabitants
are like grasshoppers.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.426 align:middle line:90%
What was--

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hello?

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: What was
he, in a helicopter?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.089 align:middle line:90%
How does he know that?

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:84%
How does he know
the Earth was round?

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I was taught that of
course, Columbus came,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
and until then you
fall off the edge.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But he's saying that
the Earth is round,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and that the inhabitants
look like grasshoppers.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And what is it--
Job, chapter 39,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and in chapter 9 of
Job, Yahweh says to Job,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
can you create the
Pleiades or Orion?

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He can.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.885 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:10%
And we could still argue--
I mean, he's bullying Job.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:10%
But again, he's
talking about this.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:10%
Amos 5:8 again, the reference to
Pleiades, Orion, a star system

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:10%
called the bear.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:84%
When I was in seminary, I asked
my Old Testament professor--

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:90%
her name is Phyllis Trible.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:90%
She's still alive.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:90%
She's a genius.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her about this.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.074 align:middle line:84%
And she honestly
said, I don't know.

00:03:22.074 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't say,
what are you, crazy?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.344 align:middle line:10%
And I have to give
credit to my seminary,

00:03:26.344 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:10%
because they
could've said, if you

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:10%
want to graduate-- I
went to Union Theological

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.155 align:middle line:10%
Seminary in New York, one of the
top seminaries in the country.

00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:10%
They could have said, you're
not writing this drivel

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:10%
and graduating from here.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:10%
They embraced it.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:10%
So I'm standing on the
shoulders of a lot of people.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.460 align:middle line:84%
We can go to-- so I
just mentioned Exodus.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, the beginning
of the Jewish exodus.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.724 align:middle line:90%
That's a UFO story.

00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:10%
I just mentioned in Isaiah--

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.556 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Fatima?

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:52.120 align:middle line:10%
Fatima is.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Oh, my God.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:10%
You and I talked about that.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:10%
Yes, we have thousands
of people seeing--

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: --this
object, which they

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:10%
said was the sun coming down?

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.939 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Come on.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Come on, come on.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's be real.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's the context
of religion and spirituality

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:90%
that intrigues me.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
We look at the story of Jesus,
the three wise men following

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:90%
a star.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, stars do not move
across the face of the earth,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and they don't shine
lights down on mangers.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they just don't.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.130 align:middle line:90%
They just don't.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't make
it bad or wrong.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a
woman who is a virgin.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
But virgin did not mean
she did not have sex.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Virgin is from the
Hebrew word "almah,"

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
which means young girl.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And we see that these
individuals have

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
the capabilities of genetics
and cloning, and what have you.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%
She could've been pregnant
without making love,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.629 align:middle line:84%
if you will, which is how I
think that Jesus came about.

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, do you believe
in the Zecharia Sitchin theory?

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Yes, I met Zecharia--
the late Zecharia Sitchin.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:90%
It just makes sense.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we have to grow up.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:90%
Childhood's end is over.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:90%
It Is over.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:84%
We have to take responsibility
for this planet.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:84%
We have to take
responsibility on how

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.110 align:middle line:84%
we deal with one another,
or else the gig is up.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not preaching
hell and damnation,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.090 align:middle line:90%
but we can destroy ourselves.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.796 align:middle line:84%
We can destroy ourselves
and this planet--

00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No question.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: --with this
belief in difference,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:90%
that we are just different.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Jesus goes up after
the crucifixion.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:90%
He goes up to heaven in what?

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:90%
A cloud.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Now our ancestors, they may
not have been as sophisticated,

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.700 align:middle line:84%
but they knew the difference
between a cloud-- and I mean,

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
they were using the
vernacular of their day.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:90%
Like in the Old Testament--

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They describe
what they saw.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: The vapor comes out.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.966 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a cloud.

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:90%
He got on that and he left.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
But they're not saying
that he got in a cloud.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:84%
They're using the
vernacular of their day.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
With all that said,
whether it's Buddha,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.992 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Lao Tzu, these
beings-- avatars, saints,

00:06:13.992 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:84%
call them what you
will-- and they're not

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:90%
all from back in the day.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:10%
They're coming to say,
there's a better way.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:10%
There's a civilized way.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:10%
There's love.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:10%
And you can cultivate that.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.369 align:middle line:10%
You have to cultivate that.

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:10%
That's where we're coming from.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.557 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Do they tell
you where they're from?

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: I never even
asked where they were from.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.348 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why not?

00:06:34.348 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: In that
moment, I'm just like,

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm just amazed that
you're in my room--

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The next visit--

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.496 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: --putting these
pictures in my head.

00:06:41.496 --> 00:06:42.961 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You've gotta ask.

00:06:42.961 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:10%
For me.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: I would ask.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:10%
There's one that came on March 5
that looked like a human being.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the reptilian.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:90%
And they had a hood on.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't see-- it was
just the outline of a face.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:90%
Like what a monk would wear.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:10%
From what I've seen,
they look like, you

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:10%
know, like the Pleiadians.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.335 align:middle line:10%
The other ones definitely
were not humanoid.

00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:10%
I mean definitely
were not human.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:10.950 align:middle line:10%
The reptilian was a reptilian.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.366 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Were they
animal-looking?

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: No.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:10%
It looked like a person.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.740 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they had a hood on,
but they had arms and legs

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:10%
and they had a hood
like a monk would wear.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What did they want?

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Like I said, all I
know from what I've-- and I

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.246 align:middle line:84%
haven't asked,
where are you from?

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm just amazed that
you're in my house.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:90%
How did you do this?

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm still at that
level, to tell what

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.215 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing now, to raise
people's vibrations.

00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:10%
And I don't know
what that means.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.700 align:middle line:10%
And when some people say, I'm
going to the fifth dimension,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:10%
I know it's a singing group in
the sixties called The Fifth

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:10%
Dimension--

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They were
pretty good, too.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.110 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: They were very good.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what
that means, but I

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.157 align:middle line:10%
know that I think
it means that we're

00:07:49.157 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:10%
going to vibrate at
a different level,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:10%
that we're going to leave
our baser instincts.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:10%
This is very difficult to do,
to change a whole paradigm,

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:10%
to change, to go from, I can
settle my differences with war,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.752 align:middle line:10%
whether it's over oil or water,
and to go, well, wait a minute.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
There's another-- that's
a change of vibration.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:90%
That's a change of a paradigm.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a difficult
thing to do.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But we have to do it because
the stakes are much too high.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you
talk to parishioners,

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a
better word, right,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.442 align:middle line:84%
does the subject
of ufology come up?

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.135 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:32.606 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From them or from you?

00:08:32.606 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yes and no.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:90%
It won't come up for me.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.630 align:middle line:84%
People after a
service-- first of all,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.306 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a Unitarian
Universalist denomination.

00:08:41.306 --> 00:08:42.180 align:middle line:90%
We're getting better.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Which is what?

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Unitarians-- the
quick explanation is this.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Unitarians rejected the Trinity.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:84%
We said that there's
no scriptural--

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:84%
it's a weird
mathematical formula.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And we say that there's
one God, unitarian.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Universalists say
that God is love.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:84%
They both came from Europe to
the shores of this country.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.086 align:middle line:84%
Unitarianism here 1825,
Universalism came in the 1700s.

00:09:09.086 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:84%
John Murray brought it over
from England, New Hope,

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Pennsylvania, the whole bit.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
The theological points are
this, that Universalists say,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.610 align:middle line:84%
if God is love, then no one's
going to be barbecued in hell.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.804 align:middle line:90%
Because it boggles the mind.

00:09:23.804 --> 00:09:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ain't gonna happen.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.011 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: If God is love.

00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Because love would not do that.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The Unitarians say that
there was only one God,

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:90%
And so they merged in 1961.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
We looked at Jesus as
the great example, not

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.670 align:middle line:84%
the great exception-- that
Jesus was a human being who

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.929 align:middle line:84%
was so God-intoxicated,
if you will.

00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going beyond
that now, saying

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:90%
that he was possibly a hybrid.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:10%
But we are the most
rational, very well-educated,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:10%
upper middle-class denomination.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:10%
So this is kind of
far out for them.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:84%
But people-- we talked
about "Ancient Aliens."

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:84%
People saw me on
"Ancient Aliens."

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:84%
They come up and shake my hand
at the end of the service.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:90%
They want more.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.504 align:middle line:84%
Or they say, I
listen to your show.

00:10:14.504 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling the truth.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:10%
Or they'll say, of
late, they'll say,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:10%
well I watch "Ancient Aliens."

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.590 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like, oh, really?

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They're into this.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: So they're into it.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.693 align:middle line:10%
Now, they're not asking me
to preach it from the pulpit,

00:10:24.693 --> 00:10:26.700 align:middle line:10%
and I don't feel called to.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:10%
But at least it's not where
it would have been maybe 10,

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:10%
15 years ago.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I wouldn't even
have had a job there,

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.927 align:middle line:84%
if I was talking this
openly about this.

00:10:34.927 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But I don't preach
it from the pulpit.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel called
to start a UFO church,

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
even though I've heard
of some people who have.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.590 align:middle line:90%
But it's two different things.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I just want people
to come together.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I want them to-- I want us to
look, whether it's race or war

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the
craziness we get into,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I want us to start looking
at that in a different way,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:90%
and to grow up.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:10%
And that includes me.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.300 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I have my
biases and prejudices.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And I wake up every
day, and I need to say,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.101 align:middle line:84%
you could have done
that differently,

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
or you could have handled that
differently, or what have you.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.035 align:middle line:90%
But it's doable.

00:11:12.035 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What's so
amazing, Michael,

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:90%
is that this is a vast universe.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
They're finding planets
by the hundreds.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:10%
It is only a matter
of time where

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:10%
they're going to find
life out there and know

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:10%
that it's intelligent.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:10%
But I also believe that that
intelligent life has already

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:10%
found us.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: I agree.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.176 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I mean, we're four
and a half billion years

00:11:32.176 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:10%
old as a planet.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.080 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
14 billion years.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's give another society
two billion years ahead of us.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:10%
That's all we're talking about.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Just two billion years.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.499 align:middle line:10%
Can you imagine the
things they possess?

00:11:44.499 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Assuming they didn't
obliterate themselves?

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: And some of them
have obliterated themselves,

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.205 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I bet.

00:11:50.205 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: And from the
literature, some of them

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:84%
are coming to say, we
don't want to happen

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:90%
to us to happened to you.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.930 align:middle line:84%
There are some like
the Pleiadians, who,

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
reading other contactees who've
had that contact with them

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:90%
saying, but you have free will.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.451 align:middle line:84%
We cannot step in and say
this is how it's done.

00:12:11.451 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We could, but
we're not going to.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Right.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.900 align:middle line:84%
There's some galactic
federation or what have you.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But then there are others who
contactees have said, yeah,

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:84%
but some of them have
told me-- Jim Sparks,

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:84%
for instance-- that we will
if we had to because we're not

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:84%
going to let you
ruin this planet.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful line in the
remake of "The Day The Earth

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Stood Still," with
Keanu Reeves, and I

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:84%
forget-- Connelly's
her last name.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Very attractive woman.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Good actress.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.556 align:middle line:10%
And she says to Klaatu,
"You've come to help us."

00:12:39.556 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Jennifer Connelly.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Yes.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:84%
He said if the
earth dies, you die.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:10%
But if the earth
lives, you still live.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:10%
The earth doesn't need us.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:10%
She doesn't need us.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.980 align:middle line:10%
We need her.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.630 align:middle line:10%
And so--

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.379 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: She was here
long before we were.

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:00.817 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: And will be
here when we're gone.

00:13:00.817 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:10%
And she will cleanse
herself, I think.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What
fascinates you the most

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.322 align:middle line:10%
about what you work on now?

00:13:06.322 --> 00:13:08.560 align:middle line:84%
'Cause I suspect it's
changed your life.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.465 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: It has changed
my life, to a degree.

00:13:11.465 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It's up there with being a
dad and being married-- just

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:84%
how my life has a purpose,
in the sense of the work I

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:84%
do as a diversity
consultant, getting people

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to see that diversity
is bigger than race.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.142 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is a
diversity consultant?

00:13:39.142 --> 00:13:41.708 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: What I do is, I
was a diversity officer--

00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:43.124 align:middle line:10%
they called me
"officer," I didn't

00:13:43.124 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:10%
have a badge-- at a
hospital in Asheville.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:10%
And what I did was--
I did many things.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.780 align:middle line:10%
I taught classes on
different and how

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:10%
to be accepting of
difference, taught

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:10%
classes on how when we go into
the different communities,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.755 align:middle line:10%
whether it's the gay
community, whether it's

00:14:01.755 --> 00:14:05.150 align:middle line:10%
the African-American community,
Latino community, that we have

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.125 align:middle line:10%
to go in, find not
what we can teach you,

00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:10%
but what can we learn from you?

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:90%
What are your needs?

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Going through the religious
thing of, if you're Muslim,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:84%
an orthodox Muslim and you
come into the hospital,

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:84%
if you're Orthodox Jew, how
can we make your stay better

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:90%
and let you keep your integrity?

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Just dealing with differences.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are people
open to that?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.900 align:middle line:90%
And they respond to it.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of that journey,
because the folk that I'm

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.540 align:middle line:84%
talking about, they
just live off-world.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:90%
But they are different.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:90%
And they're diverse.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:10%
And we have to be able and
grown up enough to communicate.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Many different
kinds of races up there.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.922 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Just
like we have here.

00:14:55.922 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:10%
Just like we have here.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they somehow
have mastered getting along.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: They have.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.405 align:middle line:90%
They have.

00:15:02.405 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:84%
At least the beings that
I've been in contact with,

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:90%
and the people I've talked to.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: So I'm not
sure I'd get along

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:10%
with the praying
mantis-looking ones.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.099 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Well,
just aesthetically,

00:15:09.099 --> 00:15:11.514 align:middle line:10%
just to look at them-- but
that's the challenge, isn't it?

00:15:11.514 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But have you ever
looked at a little insect

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:90%
praying mantis?

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They look so intelligent, the
way their little head looks,

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.105 align:middle line:84%
and it turns, and they stare at
you with their big beady eyes?

00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: But they're that big.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Now suppose one comes
in your room at night.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About your size.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Yes.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.281 align:middle line:10%
With the same cute
little beady eyes.

00:15:30.281 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.501 align:middle line:10%
So you know--

00:15:31.501 --> 00:15:33.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Why are you in my room?

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: I'm still
at that phase.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:40.869 align:middle line:10%
But I'm sure I will have
these-- I will tell you this.

00:15:40.869 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I went to a good
friend of mine who's

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
a psychic, who knew
nothing about this.

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At all.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.616 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Well, I
didn't tell him--

00:15:47.616 --> 00:15:48.845 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --your story.

00:15:48.845 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: They told me my story.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:10%
But they did say to me
that other races have

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.710 align:middle line:10%
been visiting me, Michael.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.330 align:middle line:10%
But they said to me,
he's deceased now.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Not conveniently, but his
name was Michael Gene Ashley.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.904 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he could
remote view-- I mean,

00:16:02.904 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
he could have worked
for the government.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:90%
He was that talented.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.316 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe he did.

00:16:06.316 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: He took a--
well, I don't know.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:10%
He took a class.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.132 align:middle line:10%
He took a workshop, the silver
mind control method back in--

00:16:12.132 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Oh yeah.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.510 align:middle line:10%
I took that too.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: And that
opened him up to this.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:10%
And he told me-- I
didn't mention it.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:10%
I was still in the
closet about it.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.680 align:middle line:10%
And he said, he lived up on
150th and Riverside in Harlem,

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:10%
and I went up to his house.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:10%
And he said man,
I want you-- look.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.132 align:middle line:84%
You brought some people
in my house with you.

00:16:32.132 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's some
little people around you.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:35.621 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:38.399 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: And he says,
they look like leprechauns.

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:39.940 align:middle line:84%
But they have things
to do, something

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:90%
to do with outer space.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.882 align:middle line:84%
I had never mentioned
that to him at all.

00:16:42.882 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't mentioned it to
anybody at that point,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.760 align:middle line:90%
except the therapist.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And then before he died, we did
several readings about that.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But he told me it was
past life related,

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but he said-- as we met
every year, whatever

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
to do-- there were other
visitors visiting me.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:90%
So who knows?

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I used to
think this whole talk

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
about a galactic
federation was just

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.525 align:middle line:84%
kinda "Kumbaya,"
a new agey thing.

00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:10%
But I'm starting to--

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: I think it's
probably pretty smart.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: It's real.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We're not in it.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.329 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yet.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:15.881 align:middle line:90%
But we fight too much.

00:17:15.881 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:10%
We fight too much.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Would you let us
in it if you were them?

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.440 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: I don't even
know if I'd let me in it.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'd let you in it.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:90%
But I wouldn't let us in it.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: No.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd say this
is a planet that's

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:90%
all they do is kill each other.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.056 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Well, and we
have the nuclear thing.

00:17:28.056 --> 00:17:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the reason that
all these sightings occurred

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:84%
in the '50s after we were the
most powerful nation on earth.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.630 align:middle line:84%
We split the atom over
two civilian cities--

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And now
they show up, right?

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.846 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER:--which is
an act of terrorism.

00:17:38.846 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:10%
I mean, these weren't
military installations.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:10%
And they've come
and they've said,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:10%
it's like putting a gun
in the hand of a child.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Your spirituality has not
caught up with your technology.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And we love technology.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think in
our culture, we've

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:90%
mistaken information for wisdom.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.770 align:middle line:84%
We got all the
information you want.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:90%
I got too much information.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But we've mistaken
that for wisdom.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.810 align:middle line:90%
That's concerning.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:10%
We can be concerned.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.750 align:middle line:10%
I mean, knowledge
applied can be wisdom.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.532 align:middle line:10%
But just because I have
a whole lot of stats

00:18:16.532 --> 00:18:18.740 align:middle line:10%
and whatever to give you,
because the bottom line is,

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:10%
how do I apply this to
making a better world?

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And again, you don't have
to have ETs tell you this.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
But I don't care whether you're
a bricklayer or a minister

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
The point is, to be
here is to evolve,

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:84%
to learn to love, to learn
to grow, and to pass that on.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I have a daughter
who's eight years old,

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and I want her to live
in a different world.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you glad this
has happened to you, Michael?

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: I am.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.495 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No regrets?

00:18:47.495 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: No.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not a
caveat, but I also

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:90%
had people who nurtured me.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.770 align:middle line:84%
My first wife, who was a
deeply spiritual woman,

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.119 align:middle line:90%
she walked that journey with me.

00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we broke up
for other reasons

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and we're still
very good friends.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of contactees,
a lot of experiencers,

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:90%
their relationships fell apart.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: People can't handle it.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:10.969 align:middle line:90%
One or the other--

00:19:10.969 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: They can't,
because it's fringe.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:10%
It's not as fringe
now, obviously.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.850 align:middle line:10%
But at that time, what?

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:10%
Little green-- what
are you talking about?

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.016 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Would you
prefer, though,

00:19:21.016 --> 00:19:24.435 align:middle line:10%
that they would
have left you alone?

00:19:24.435 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: No.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Because all these things
I talk about-- love

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and how can we reach out and get
along-- it's one thing to think

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's another thing to talk
about it and try and do it.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to do.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I told you about the
Presbyterian brother

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.730 align:middle line:90%
who came up to me.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I agree with the
love part, but you're

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.217 align:middle line:84%
selective with
your Bible verses.

00:19:52.217 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like, well, if
you agree with the love,

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.410 align:middle line:84%
what else do we
have to talk about?

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And we have examples through
history, whether it's King

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's Jesus
or maybe some people

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
that we know and love in our
own contemporary lives that

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
have tried to talk about
this and have been shunned

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:90%
or beat up.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to--
we love Nelson Mandela.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:18.271 align:middle line:84%
My God, he's in prison
27 years, he comes out.

00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's black and white,
and we're all going to be one.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Everybody claps,
and yay, yay, yay.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:90%
But Nelson was a human being.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And what was potential in
him is potential in us.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But we like when
other people do it.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.065 align:middle line:90%
I don't want do that.

00:20:37.065 --> 00:20:37.780 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:90%
We have to do it.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:84%
We're not gonna have any
more Nelson Mandelas.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Not gonna have any more Kings.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.859 align:middle line:84%
We are the saviors that
we've been waiting for.

00:20:45.859 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:90%
No one's going to do it for us.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.816 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've brought
us some pictures

00:20:48.816 --> 00:20:50.642 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus and spaceships.

00:20:50.642 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Talk a little bit about that.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: I forgot
who gave that to me.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.018 align:middle line:84%
This was years ago
when I was in New York

00:20:55.018 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and I was in a
UFO support group.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, you know, Bud Hopkins was
helping me out, and Jean Mundy.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine
just gave that to me.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.347 align:middle line:84%
And it happened at the right
time because I was exploring--

00:21:07.347 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --what was
going on with you.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:09.661 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:21:09.661 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:90%
And they gave it to me.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And I even said to the folks at
"Ancient Aliens," if you ever

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.312 align:middle line:84%
do a thing on
Jesus, count me in.

00:21:18.312 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
see this picture.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But you're the first person
to have seen this picture.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I don't
want to trivialize Jesus.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that I believe
Jesus was a hybrid.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:84%
If you argue that
he was not a hybrid,

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.335 align:middle line:84%
he had every contact with
other world intelligences.

00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He did.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: OK.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.419 align:middle line:84%
So if he wasn't a hybrid,
he was a contactee.

00:21:40.419 --> 00:21:41.335 align:middle line:90%
He was an experiencer.

00:21:41.335 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And it's so
important, Michael, for people

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
to understand that if you
talk about things like this,

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
you're not slapping
the face of God.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.340 align:middle line:90%
At all.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
If anything, you're
adding to it.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: What
boggles my mind is

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:84%
how, if this God is this God,
this supreme whatever, little

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:84%
me, finite me, infinite it,
God doesn't need other people

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:90%
to defend God.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And so people say, well,
I'm-- the guy said,

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:90%
"I'm defending God.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.465 align:middle line:84%
And you're drawing
people away from God."

00:22:15.465 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say it, because
I'm not going to go there,

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:22.847 align:middle line:84%
but God wouldn't need
you to defend it.

00:22:22.847 --> 00:22:23.555 align:middle line:90%
This is personal.

00:22:23.555 --> 00:22:25.945 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But these
beings did come to you.

00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:26.945 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yes, they did.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.870 align:middle line:90%
Why you?

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.406 align:middle line:84%
Are there millions
of you out there?

00:22:31.406 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:32.863 align:middle line:90%
Of course there are.

00:22:32.863 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:84%
You've had them on your show
who are talking about this,

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and who are not coming
from the fear factor.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Because-- and again,
for brothers and sisters

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.620 align:middle line:84%
who've had implants
and all that,

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.376 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying--
that's traumatic.

00:22:47.376 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying,
don't make the mistake

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that we humans do of saying,
"They did this, so all of them

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:90%
do this."

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Your experience is
your experience.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Bud and I used to
get into this a lot.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And quite frankly, I would
say, "Bud, there's so much

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:90%
fear in the group."

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well, look
what happened to them."

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Yeah you're right.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.150 align:middle line:90%
But that didn't happen to me."

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.630 align:middle line:90%
My story is just as valid.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:90%
It may not be sensational.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It may not be-- if I'm talking
about we have to get together,

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:90%
that's not sensational.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not abused.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:90%
No one abducted me.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like
I was abducted.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.140 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I got a slap
in the face about, OK.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Grow up.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at the time I
was having my visits,

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:84%
I was in the theater in New York
living a fast life, you know,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
auditioning, doing shows,
going to parties afterwards.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And they came and
they didn't say this,

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.766 align:middle line:84%
but it was like, it's a
little more to it than that.

00:23:43.766 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a little more
to your life than that.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.622 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's pretty darn
fascinating, isn't it?

00:23:48.622 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: It is.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just to think
of the possibilities.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.007 align:middle line:90%
What's out there?

00:23:52.007 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: That's it.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why are
they doing this?

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But it does make
you wonder, I think,

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:84%
about your own
existence, and where

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.680 align:middle line:90%
we're headed as a species.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Well, it's paradoxical
because, yes, there's

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:10%
a divinity in me.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:84%
As Lincoln says, there's a
divinity that shapes our ends.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
But also, when I
flew here yesterday

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and I looked down,
the grasshoppers,

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I could also look
pretty insignificant.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I was a little speck.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:21.500 align:middle line:90%
So it's at both ends.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think what it is, is we
have a hard time as a culture,

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:84%
as a species, wrapping
our minds around paradox.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:90%
It's either either/or.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.695 align:middle line:84%
It's either good or
bad, as opposed to,

00:24:32.695 --> 00:24:34.820 align:middle line:84%
like, the Buddhists say--
you take the middle path.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Usually life is
somewhere in the middle.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
change our paradigms.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:41.350 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:44.480 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not saying anything
any different from A Course

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:84%
in Miracles, or some
biblical teachings.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm not saying anything
different from that.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that we're
not alone in the universe,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.101 align:middle line:84%
and these are
spiritual experiences.

00:24:58.101 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:84%
They're spiritual
experiences to me.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the best
way I can put it.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
some that think

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:90%
that we will have disclosure.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
That government will
come out and say, folks,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.920 align:middle line:90%
we've been visited.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Sorry we kept it a secret.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.600 align:middle line:90%
But that's the way it is.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.807 align:middle line:90%
And this is what's going on.

00:25:13.807 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's going
to happen that way.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: No.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.350 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's happening now.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's happening
in the sense of,

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.580 align:middle line:84%
these sightings are just--
you can't deny it anymore.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:90%
No more weather balloons.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:28.031 align:middle line:90%
I do agree with--

00:25:28.031 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And unless we have
these large, triangular-shaped

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.612 align:middle line:90%
objects, they're not ours.

00:25:32.612 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: Well, what
does Richard Borland

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.070 align:middle line:90%
say, the UFO historian?

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.370 align:middle line:84%
He says that the
way to make it work

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
is to use Mandela's
model with apartheid,

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:90%
that we have pardons for people.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:10%
And if people know that they
can come out and say what

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:10%
has gone on, but knowing
that they can be pardoned,

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.820 align:middle line:10%
it may happen faster that way.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:10%
But I mean, I don't
think we really

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.280 align:middle line:10%
need to have an
official disclosure,

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:10%
because people believe it.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So many people see it
and believe it now,

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.840 align:middle line:90%
that it's happening now.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if we wait for that,
we're not living our lives.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:90%
We're being reactive.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, as soon as they
let us know-- oh, no.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:90%
We can say we do know.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And we want to create
more exopolitics.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.530 align:middle line:90%
We want to do that.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there
Michael Carters

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.175 align:middle line:84%
in Brazil and China
and the United Kingdom?

00:26:26.175 --> 00:26:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: I believe--

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is happening
all over the place.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.069 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yes, I believe that.

00:26:30.069 --> 00:26:31.176 align:middle line:10%
I believe that.

00:26:31.176 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:10%
I believe that.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.730 align:middle line:10%
Who's the brother in Mexico,
Jamie-- I forget his last name.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.035 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jaime.

00:26:36.035 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.080 align:middle line:90%
He's doing it.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:37.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Jaime Muson.

00:26:37.955 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: He's been doing it.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:90%
They're out there.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Much more than I'm doing.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have maybe some
means or some privilege.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And this guy Jamie's
a newscaster.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, we're out there.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's going--
it used to bother me

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.290 align:middle line:84%
when I would go to-- we
need Stanton Friedman.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:57.290 align:middle line:10%
We need all these--

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.956 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: God, I hope
he goes on forever.

00:26:58.956 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:10%
He's going to be 80
years old this year.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.219 align:middle line:10%
God love him.

00:27:02.219 --> 00:27:03.760 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: He's
kicking and screaming.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.730 align:middle line:10%
I love him.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:10%
But I also want to say that
what about the contact--

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:10%
we needed John Mack.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We needed Hopkins.

00:27:10.435 --> 00:27:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yes.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
But we also need these people
who had the experience.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:90%
We need them.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we've had
the experience.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.640 align:middle line:84%
You can hypothesize, and we
need that data and all that.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But that's what made
John Mack who he was.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.300 align:middle line:84%
John Mack knew how
important to these stories

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.470 align:middle line:90%
the contactees were.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.776 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there anything
about this that scares you?

00:27:32.776 --> 00:27:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Yeah.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That there's
something wrong

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:84%
that you can't put
your finger on it?

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.618 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: Well,
the only thing that

00:27:38.618 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:10%
scares me is that there
are renegade ET brothers

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:10%
and sisters out there who maybe
have made a treaty with us

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.610 align:middle line:10%
with technology, for
whatever we want to do.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:84%
We know the story
about Eisenhower

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:90%
meeting the Granada Treaty.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If that happened.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:54.535 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: If that happened.

00:27:54.535 --> 00:27:56.180 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
walk this balance.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I walk this balance.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I know that we can't judge
a whole lot by a little bit.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know people, my
more conservative brothers

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.937 align:middle line:84%
and sisters, say
they're all demonic.

00:28:09.937 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:90%
They're all demonic.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's what Barry says.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Can you imagine that?

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:12.310 align:middle line:90%
They're--

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Barry's a
believer in that, right?

00:28:13.075 --> 00:28:15.087 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: --they're all demonic.

00:28:15.087 --> 00:28:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Barry, I think Barry
believes that they're angels.

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.836 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't believe
that they're demonic.

00:28:18.836 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:84%
He has his problems
with people who

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.240 align:middle line:90%
believe that they're demonic.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But isn't that immature
to judge a whole species?

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe
they're everything.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CARTER: I think
they're like us.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.760 align:middle line:10%
I think there are
more evolved people,

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:10%
and I think there are
less evolved people.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:10%
And so the discernment--
and because we

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:10%
are so enamored
with technology, did

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.510 align:middle line:10%
we sell our souls
for technology?

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.070 align:middle line:90%
That worries me.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.787 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People want
Alien Scriptures.

00:28:46.787 --> 00:28:48.120 align:middle line:90%
They want to go to your website.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.030 align:middle line:90%
How do they find you?

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.385 align:middle line:10%
>>CARTER: They can go
to michaeljscarter.com.

00:28:52.385 --> 00:28:54.040 align:middle line:10%
That's my website.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:10%
Write me there.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.070 align:middle line:10%
We can blog.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can pick up the
book at Barnes & Noble's.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.690 align:middle line:90%
It's in softcover.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.850 align:middle line:90%
It's like $9.49.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:90%
$4.99 on Kindle and Nook.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.204 align:middle line:84%
Alien Scriptures, Reverend
Michael JS Carter.

00:29:08.204 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Reverend,
thanks so much.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:90%
You take care of yourself.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.690 align:middle line:90%
We need more people like you.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CARTER: Bless you.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.053 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for saying that.

00:29:14.053 --> 00:29:15.005 align:middle line:90%
And you as well.

00:29:15.005 --> 00:29:17.350 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: "Beyond Belief,"
where we look at just

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:24.660 align:middle line:10%
about every possibility--
ETs, aliens, and angels.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:25.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
