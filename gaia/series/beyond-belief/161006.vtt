00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GREG NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:10%
For years, we have investigated
the Starchild Project

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.020 align:middle line:10%
with the late Lloyd Pye.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, two investigators
have come forward

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
with more information, Chase
Kloetzke and Kerry McClure.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, is a
replica of the Starchild,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:84%
which is a creature that
was discovered years ago.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And you will notice
the elongation

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
of the back of the skull, where
many people thought, maybe,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:84%
just maybe, this is of
extraterrestrial origin.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Chase and Kerry.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Great to have you
on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KERRY MCCLURE: Thank you.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CHASE KLOETZKE: It's
great to be with you.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: This is
a replica, right?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:10%
It's not the real thing.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: It is a
replica, absolutely.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where is
the real Starchild?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: The
real Starchild skull

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.990 align:middle line:84%
is with Melanie Young,
the original owner.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah, it's kept in
a protected place at the moment,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:10%
because of the laws.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:10%
It's illegal to transport,
profit from, display

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.827 align:middle line:10%
the skull further.

00:01:20.827 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us a little
background, Chase, if you can,

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
into the Starchild and
where it was discovered,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.507 align:middle line:90%
how it was discovered.

00:01:28.507 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we'll
talk a little bit

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
about the work of
the late Lloyd Pye

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and then your brand new work.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to reveal
some new information today

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:90%
on "Beyond Belief."

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:90%
But tell us about the project.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: The project started
with Melanie Young approaching

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:90%
me at a conference.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And I had just finished talking
about admissibility and DNA

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and how the forensic scientific
approach is not only necessary

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
but required in
today's investigations.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me to take over
and conduct further examination

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:90%
from where Lloyd Pye finished.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Didn't want to do it that way.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I felt, out of respect, that
I wanted to have Lloyd's work,

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:90%
not stand on his shoulders.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.357 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:02:15.357 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: But I did agree to
look at it as a brand new case,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.140 align:middle line:90%
like a cold case.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Let me just go in blind
and start from scratch

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.794 align:middle line:90%
with new eyes.

00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, Lloyd was a
guest on "Coast to Coast"

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.930 align:middle line:90%
for years with me.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.617 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And all he
wanted was authentication.

00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Exactly.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because we would
talk for hours about,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:90%
is it extraterrestrial?

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it a human?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:90%
A deformed human?

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:84%
He said, I just want
to get to the facts

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.775 align:middle line:90%
and get to the bottom line.

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'd like.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
His own personal
beliefs were important.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:90%
But he just wanted the truth.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Where was this
discovered exactly?

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Mexico.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have a definitive
or what we would call

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:90%
a probative chain-of-custody.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's really oral
history or he-said she-said

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:84%
coming up to where Melanie Young
can tell the story that she

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:84%
was told from the person
she received the skull from.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So at this point,
it basically was

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.342 align:middle line:84%
found in a cave near Chihuahua's
Copper Mines area of Mexico.

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
caves-- everything's

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:90%
in caves these days.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.855 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Everything's
in caves exactly.

00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:19.938 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: It's preserved.

00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was there
more to the body?

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just the
skull that they found?

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:10%
>>MCCLURE: There was a
whole skeleton next to it

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:10%
with a typical skull,
with a normal skull.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a body
found with that as well.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was buried under
some dust, debris, dirt.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And because it was in a cave,
it was preserved that way.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.760 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't compacted.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:90%
The bones didn't deteriorate.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And in order for it
to be called the Starchild,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.370 align:middle line:84%
it was because it was a
smaller specimen, compared

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:90%
to the one they found it with.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I think they
thought, maybe, the mother

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
was with the child when
they both perished?

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Absolutely, and DNA
results that Lloyd uncovered

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
found that the adult
female skull found with

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.997 align:middle line:90%
the Starchild's skull--

00:04:09.997 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:90%
they're not related.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
not related at all.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Mm-hm.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe a friend.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a nanny.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.385 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.390 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: That's one of the--

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.206 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, of
course, the work

00:04:17.206 --> 00:04:21.330 align:middle line:84%
was started by the
great late Lloyd Pye.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:90%
- Hi, I'm Lloyd Pye.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is an exact
stereo-lithographic copy

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:90%
of the famous Starchild skull.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
The Starchild skull is
a real, true, bone skull

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.930 align:middle line:84%
that was found in Mexico
around the Copper Canyon area,

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:90%
about 1930.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Carbon-14 analysis
has shown that it

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:90%
died about 900 years ago.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, it is
very different in shape

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:90%
from a typical human skull.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.150 align:middle line:84%
But over the last 10 years,
with the Starchild Project,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:84%
we've had dozens of
experts examine it.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And they can come up with no
kind of typical human deformity

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle line:84%
that matches all of the usual
things about this skull.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It's unusual physiology
begins with the bone itself.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:84%
It's uniformly half as
thick as normal human bone.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And it weighs half as much.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:90%
It's very light by comparison.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's two or
three times as hard.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.380 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely durable.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
We think some of durability
comes from very unusual fibers,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
woven through the matrix
of the bone, never seen

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:90%
in any other animal of any kind.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:84%
There's also a red
residue found in the bone

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.460 align:middle line:84%
in the cancellous
holes that is also

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:84%
very unlike any other
bone that is known.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have those unusual
attributes right off the bat.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Then, in the rear,
we see that it

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:84%
lacks an inion, which is
that knot that we all have

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:90%
in the back rear of our heads.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has that.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Chimps have it.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Gorillas have it.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Everything has it.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's where your
neck muscles attach.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
It's neck muscles
attach all the way

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:84%
down here, right on top
of the foramen magnum,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.960 align:middle line:84%
meaning it has a
very small neck,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:84%
like half the size of
a normal human neck.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.319 align:middle line:84%
And it sits at a
different angle.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.735 align:middle line:84%
The head sits at
a different angle

00:06:11.735 --> 00:06:13.760 align:middle line:90%
than a normal human head--

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:90%
very different.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Chewing muscle very much
reduced-- normally up here--

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:90%
down here in the Starchild.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Very small lower face--

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:90%
look at these eye sockets.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Look how shallow
they are, not even as

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.750 align:middle line:84%
deep as the first knuckle of my
finger, not even a full inch.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.080 align:middle line:84%
In a human being, two full
inches, all the way up

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:90%
to here-- that depth.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
The eyes themselves
are centered down here

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
nose, so that the eyes are

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:84%
down here, rather than up at
the top like our eyes-- very,

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.830 align:middle line:84%
very unusual eyes,
unusual in so many ways.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.528 align:middle line:90%
No sinuses in here.

00:06:45.528 --> 00:06:46.424 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:46.424 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chase, what
would this entity look

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:84%
like if there was a
drawing of the head?

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We had a FBI
forensic artist actually

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.170 align:middle line:84%
reconstruct and
replace the bones

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
that obviously were on
the Starchild at one time.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:90%
You could put it together.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And there was a definite,
very normal looking child.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately--

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.265 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did it look deformed?

00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:16.973 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Well, of
course, because of--

00:07:16.973 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: [INAUDIBLE]
of the close-set eyes.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:84%
There's probably a lot of
something going on right here

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.680 align:middle line:90%
that just doesn't look normal.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did your work start
before or after Lloyd Pye died?

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: After.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After he died.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Mm-hm.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.476 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Two years after.

00:07:31.476 --> 00:07:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you picked up the
gauntlet after he passed on.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah, and I hadn't
really thought of it like that.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:84%
When Melanie first asked
if I would take this on,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
it was a huge challenge
to me to say yes.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Because Lloyd was so sincere, so
loved, and had worked so hard.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:84%
He spent 16 years of his
life completely devoted

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:90%
to this skull.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.602 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to degrade
any of that awesome reputation--

00:08:03.602 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, I understand.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.101 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: --or that fondness.

00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And what if we
found something that

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:84%
was contradictive
or contraindicated?

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't here with us to
partner with us to go forward.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:90%
So it was a huge challenge.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And I almost did not accept
it, because there's also

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:90%
a community--

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mm-hm.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.258 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: --a
community of people

00:08:26.258 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
tens of thousands

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that follow every word
on this Starchild skull.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:90%
And we were all hoping--

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.329 align:middle line:84%
all hoping-- for
awesome results.

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:38.662 align:middle line:90%
I've been doing this since 1994.

00:08:38.662 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, it's
been a long time.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.058 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I'm
looking for evidence

00:08:41.058 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:90%
of UFOs or extraterrestrials.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this was the
world's, probably, best

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.200 align:middle line:84%
chance, the best
piece of evidence

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:90%
we had that we could test.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's been--

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have seen
the Gaia special reports,

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:90%
"Nazca Unearthed," right?

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yes.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there are some
similarities in the look,

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
with this skull
and those skulls.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, those skulls look a
little more elongated to me,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.740 align:middle line:84%
a little more alien-gray
type, than this one does.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:84%
To me, looking at this skull
and, of course, the side of it,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:84%
doesn't look that
extraterrestrial to me.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:90%
How about you?

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: When we
really examined--

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:84%
when you get your
hands on the skull

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and can actually look at
certain things, it is bulbous.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:90%
It's brachycephalic, absolutely.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:84%
But the flatness on
the back is explained

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
by a very modern syndrome these
days, called flathead syndrome.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So if, for some
reason, this child

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:84%
was deformed to the
point of immobility,

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.795 align:middle line:84%
he probably would have
laid on his back a lot.

00:09:53.795 --> 00:09:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Because one thing we have--

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they didn't
have wheelchairs then, right?

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right, exactly.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.923 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: And it
was found in Mexico.

00:09:59.923 --> 00:10:03.191 align:middle line:84%
So these were most likely
Native American family members,

00:10:03.191 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:84%
where they just carried their
children on their backs.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.356 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they have
kept the child alive?

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Or would they have
for ended it's life?

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:90%
Terminated it?

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: Well, everyone
agrees that it's probably

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:90%
around 5-years-old.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.252 align:middle line:90%
So somebody cared for him.

00:10:15.252 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kept it alive.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Right.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: And he
had teeth growing in.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.116 align:middle line:84%
He shows healthy
signs of growing.

00:10:21.116 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes, yes.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:90%
He was--

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: So
somebody loved him.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:90%
Somebody did, yes.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No way to
determine how it died?

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: My kids
asked me that.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.207 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, I
never thought of that!

00:10:32.207 --> 00:10:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Because I don't think it--

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Smart kid.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.773 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: --was a malnutrition.

00:10:34.773 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.362 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, if
it was immobile,

00:10:38.362 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:84%
it could have died of
something as simple

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.007 align:middle line:84%
as pneumonia, just
because it's not moving.

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: 900 years ago.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And when the little girl
found the skeletons in a cave,

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:84%
she said also that its
body was deformed too.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:84%
So that also leads to it
not being very mobile.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.240 align:middle line:90%
And with its flat head--

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Of course--

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah, and that
leads to the lack of an inion

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:90%
too, actually, right?

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the
variable here is

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
the body of the woman
found near the baby, right?

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Which--
her skull proved

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to be very interesting
to the X-ray techs

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and to some of the people that
really study the oseology,

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:90%
especially in skulls.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Because she had numerous--

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:23.297 align:middle line:84%
I believe we counted over
15 concussion fractures.

00:11:23.297 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: And on her skull--

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it might
have been beaten?

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:26.405 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: Up-- absolutely.

00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:10%
>>MCCLURE: Yes.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: And--

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That's intriguing.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:10%
>>KLOETZKE: --very evident.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:10%
And there were a
lot of experts, when

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:10%
they saw the skulls,
they'd run right over,

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.550 align:middle line:10%
because they were discussing
these concussion fractures.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And like, but the Starchild
skull's right here.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
But they seemed very
interested in that.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Of course, with football
players and this being

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest
discoveries right now.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would these individuals
have been considered Aztecs,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:90%
because it was found in Mexico?

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: Well, I
did a little research.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And about 900 years ago, the
area where they were found

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:90%
were the Mogollon.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And they were a very
spiritual religious tribe.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like a lot of
these other tribes,

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:84%
they also believed they
came from star people.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: So it's
almost so fitting

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
that it's called
the Starchild skull.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But something that they
do that's interesting

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:84%
is they have a ceremony for when
they die, a burial ceremony.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.499 align:middle line:84%
And they put these decorated
plates on their faces.

00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And they poke a
hole, so their spirit

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:84%
can go out and live
with the village.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they're buried
under their homes.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:84%
These two skeletons did not
have any kind of pottery

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:90%
found that we know of.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:90%
They weren't buried under homes.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.710 align:middle line:90%
They were almost outcasts.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And she had so many
concussions, who

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.531 align:middle line:84%
knows what her mental
state was like then.

00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: So, yeah.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, what would have
caused those concussions?

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Falls?

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Beatings?

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: All of it.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All of it?

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: All of
the above, absolutely.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't feel normal--

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: --for
you and I and Kerry

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:90%
to walk around with these.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
But they're finding that
people in these types

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
of situations of probable
abuse or aggressive force--

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But definitely blows
to the head of some type.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes, yes.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How about the child?

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Any blows to the head?

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We
couldn't find any.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And what's difficult
about looking

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
for some of the anomalies
on the Starchild skull

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:84%
is we've realized that,
unfortunately, it's

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:28.240 align:middle line:84%
been polished, sanded,
cleaned, varnished, lacquered.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, the skull
has, through its lifetime--

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:84%
allegedly, when
Melanie and Lloyd first

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:84%
got it, it was
mounted on a plaque,

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
because it was on someone's wall
for many years and on a mantle.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:90%
And I look at the little skull.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And he-- the one thing
that's not disputed

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.990 align:middle line:90%
is that he's 5-years-old.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And this little guy,
I kind of feel like--

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's kind
of sad, isn't it?

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.455 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: It is.

00:13:59.455 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:00.996 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: It is, very sad.

00:14:00.996 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So let's look at
the Starchild reconstructed.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, here we have Lloyd Pye, of
course, holding up the replica.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Or is that the authentic one?

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.950 align:middle line:10%
What do you think, Chase?

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:10%
Is that the real deal?

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: It would
be the real deal, yes.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.396 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It is the real
deal, OK-- which, of course,

00:14:16.396 --> 00:14:20.270 align:middle line:84%
the replica looks pretty
identical to that.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:90%
It is unusual.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's no construction.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:90%
So they put it together.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.885 align:middle line:84%
It looks like one of those
martians in the martian movies,

00:14:29.885 --> 00:14:30.685 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:14:30.685 --> 00:14:31.485 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: It does.

00:14:31.485 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:90%
It looks unusual.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.825 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is weird.

00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: [DEEP SIGH]

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, if it were
human, it's not normal.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:90%
That is a given, right?

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.114 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: That's true.

00:14:42.114 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: The
reconstruction was

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:84%
done without the other
parts of the anatomy

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
or his skull put
back into place.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So it looks completely
different when

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
you add the features that you
know were there at one time.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It does.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:58.650 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Like, under
the eye sockets are broken.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's clearly
broken, which affects

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:90%
how shallow the measurement is.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But once that's reconstructed
back to a normal,

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:90%
they're still a little shallow.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But it does change
the reconstruction.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But that is something
that the advancement--

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and the more we know in
each year-- that's probably

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
not something Lloyd would
have had access to when

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.680 align:middle line:90%
that was done the first time.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Mm-hm.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Now, we have
access to FBI forensic artists.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.480 align:middle line:84%
They do this to
solve major crimes

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:90%
all over the world with MI5--

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:90%
she works very closely with.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have access to
those people to be involved.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.605 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm just
wondering that,

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:44.910 align:middle line:84%
because the child was different
and because of the concussions

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
on the female, if this
child wasn't subjected

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.770 align:middle line:90%
to some kind of abuse.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.104 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I worry about that.

00:15:52.104 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because
it was different.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes,
absolutely-- or unproductive.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:84%
900 years ago with
these small communities

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:84%
or Native American tribes,
they survived off each other

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:90%
having talents.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:90%
And everybody chipped in.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you were a
child that was going

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
to grow up to be a burden
and not a contributor,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:84%
chances are that you
probably wouldn't

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.367 align:middle line:90%
have been treated very well.

00:16:15.367 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's too bad the
child can't come back and talk

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:90%
about what happened.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: I know.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:84%
This touches my children's
hearts so deeply,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:84%
because I have a
special needs child.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:90%
And so my son looks at that.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, there might
be children in your class

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:90%
with some of these issues.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.274 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same things, yeah.

00:16:31.274 --> 00:16:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: And
today, we find ways

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.620 align:middle line:84%
to educate them and help
them find some kind of work

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:90%
and treat them like people.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Back then, who knows
how they were treated.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.338 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did you initially
get involved in this project

00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:90%
after the fact?

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Basically
because, when she first

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
pulled the skull out, George,
the first thing I felt

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:84%
was immediate sympathy--
immediate sympathy.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: And I thought--

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.571 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I feel that too.

00:16:56.571 --> 00:16:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah,
and it's strong.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And I actually got a
little emotional at first.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:08.566 align:middle line:84%
And once I reconciled that Lloyd
asked Melanie to continue--

00:17:08.566 --> 00:17:09.690 align:middle line:90%
don't forget the Starchild.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: When he was dying?

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:11.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Don't let it end.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And she made that promise that
she would finish his work.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And that meant a lot.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that I
knew I could do it.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a physical artifact,
for a lack of a human aspect.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.189 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: But we had to
treat it, this little skull,

00:17:30.189 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
like evidence and
an artifact, which

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
proved to be very
difficult, especially

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.307 align:middle line:84%
going in with a Dremel
and taking more samples

00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:90%
off this little guy.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right, so--

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: It was brutal.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --you continued
with the project.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Mm-hm.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you do
additional DNA testing?

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:44.316 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:44.316 --> 00:17:48.462 align:middle line:84%
We had to, because
the DNA now, of today,

00:17:48.462 --> 00:17:49.545 align:middle line:90%
is so much more advanced--

00:17:49.545 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: --than when-- yeah--

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:90%
when Lloyd had--

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: More advanced.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:90%
More cheap also.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And--

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --what
were the results?

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: The
results with the DNA--

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
first, we got the
mitochondrial back,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
which confirmed the three other
tests that Lloyd had performed,

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:11.380 align:middle line:84%
from Trace Genetics, Bold Lab,
and also Stanford University.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So we had ours done
by a Paleono lab,

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:90%
because we're realizing that--

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Reputable?

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yes.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: They
specialize in ancient DNA.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes, because
that's how specialized it's

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:90%
become these days.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So it was wonderful to
have access to that.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But it absolutely came
back-- mitochondrial--

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.262 align:middle line:90%
as haplogroup C1.

00:18:31.262 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What does that mean?

>>NOORY: You say that with
a little hesitation, Chase.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.434 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Well, I say it
because I was so disappointed.

00:18:42.434 --> 00:18:47.499 align:middle line:84%

divergence, differences--

00:18:47.499 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Don't be disappointed.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:84%
The truth should not
be disappointing.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I wanted
an alien or a hybrid.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I'm
sure everybody does.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: That's
why we started.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I think, first and
foremost, you want the truth.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:18:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You want to

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: The main goal.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I think,
god rest his soul,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Lloyd Pye would have said, darn!

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.270 align:middle line:84%
I wanted this to be
a real star child.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.820 align:middle line:90%
But at least we know what it is.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Exactly.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.781 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: And I
think the example--

00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and why it's so important
to talk about the Starchild,

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.870 align:middle line:84%
even though it has come out
human, because the nuclear DNA,

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:90%
we were able to extract--

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:90%
very difficult to do.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:90%
I was worried sick.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.769 align:middle line:84%
I've done many
extractions of DNA,

00:19:28.769 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
especially from the skulls,
because I've worked in Peru

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:90%
on the elongated skulls.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Actually, a little over
300 forensic samples

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.310 align:middle line:90%
validated so far in my work.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.370 align:middle line:90%
So I was still nervous.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.450 align:middle line:90%
He's a little guy.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And as a mom and a grandmother,
that never left me.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So the dignity-- we hope--
we know that Lloyd also

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:84%
appreciated, because that
was something he always felt

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:90%
was appropriate.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So when the nuclear
DNA came back,

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:04.357 align:middle line:84%
as haplogroup Q, which
94% of that group

00:20:04.357 --> 00:20:05.440 align:middle line:90%
comes from South America--

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: So this
is all making sense.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Easy to determine.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Mm-hm.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Easy to determine.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:84%
There was, even in
the phenotyping,

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:18.190 align:middle line:84%
which is your genetic
codes or your genetic DNA

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:90%
with your environment.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:84%
It brings out that
phenotyping result. And--

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Voila.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: --everything.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.476 align:middle line:84%

was just nothing

00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:84%
contra-indicating
anything but human.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm very confident that
it is an alien skull.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not a human
hybrid, as we thought

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.880 align:middle line:90%
it was for quite some time.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it's, without
question, going

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:90%
to prove out to be an alien.

National Institute of Health.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%

>>KLOETZKE: Of course, yes.

00:21:21.815 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Very disappointing,
because you need

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:84%
to believe what you're
reading, when there's

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.940 align:middle line:90%
an investigation going on.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:84%

>>KLOETZKE: But there is an
unnamed geneticist that is

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:90%
frequently--

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.107 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why would he do this?

00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:84%

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: --do this?

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Attention, probably, to
be involved with something

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:84%
as remarkable as, possibly,
extraterrestrial evidence.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He had
Lloyd so convinced

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.004 align:middle line:84%
that this was an
extraterrestrial.

00:22:01.004 --> 00:22:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah, George,
it's really sad, because--

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I mean, you heard him.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:90%
He went out on a limb like that.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.225 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Right,
but he clearly

00:22:06.225 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:90%
believed he was a geneticist.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And we found out, he
is not a geneticist.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:90%
He's a virologist--

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.458 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: --that
works at a university.

00:22:13.458 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So Lloyd was misled.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.319 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Unfortunately.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.026 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your
work and your homework

00:22:19.026 --> 00:22:20.936 align:middle line:90%
found out that he was misled.

00:22:20.936 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it has to do
with my skill-sets too.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Trained as a private
investigator,

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I definitely was suspicious
with some of the claims

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
that we were reading
on the Starchild skull.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, the skull is six times
stronger or three times

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:90%
stronger than a normal skull.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
who tested that?

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Where-- so as we dug deeper
into some of the work,

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
we realized that Lloyd
trusted his experts.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right--

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.845 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: And unfortunately--

00:22:51.845 --> 00:22:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --he did, explicitly.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Exactly.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: And
then there was one--

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.281 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He believed
a lot of people.

00:22:56.281 --> 00:22:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah,
there was one who

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.780 align:middle line:84%
absolutely discredited
and falsified information

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:03.981 align:middle line:90%
and reports to Lloyd.

00:23:03.981 --> 00:23:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wish Lloyd
were still with us today--

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:06.938 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Maybe he is.

00:23:06.938 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --to be sitting here

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.670 align:middle line:90%

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.045 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would he
agree with you?

00:23:12.045 --> 00:23:12.932 align:middle line:90%
Or would he fight if?

00:23:12.932 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I think
he would agree.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:90%
In fact--

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.176 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: I think
he would agree.

00:23:16.176 --> 00:23:17.210 align:middle line:90%
He wrote in his book--

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.300 align:middle line:90%
he had some goals.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was to
have citizens look at it

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:90%
and figure out the truth.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And the other one was to have
real scientists do some testing

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
on it, without being
afraid of what it could be.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.380 align:middle line:90%
And we did both of those things.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:90%
So I think--

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he had his doubts
about this project, as he was--

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: He did.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:90%
Well

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --dying, didn't he?

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.294 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: He did.

00:23:38.294 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you
got the answers

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.360 align:middle line:84%
that he was looking for
after all these years.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I think it was,
now, with the education

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and the discoveries that we're
finding just out in space--

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.110 align:middle line:84%
it's like, daily,
headlines are coming out

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:84%
of more planets, more
evidence of hybrid race

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth, even in
antiquity, or antediluvian.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: It's just amazing
at this point when things--

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:84%
we're using the most incredible
higher-than-normal credential

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:90%
experts.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Every single person that
looked at this skull

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
was mainstream science, with
above-normal credentials.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think he would have
been so happy with that.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.520 align:middle line:90%
It's all he wanted.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can we throw
a conspiracy in here

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and say that the DNA testing
was misled to mislead you

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and you, Kerry?

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.894 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:24:35.894 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I say, no.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: I say, no, too.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Because,
honestly, the DNA

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
that we had-- the results
were verified by the three

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:44.530 align:middle line:90%
he had done.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What if government--

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: If they
were all [INAUDIBLE]----

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --got to this
guy, or the DNA company--

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: We--

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and said, we do not
want you to tell them that this

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.647 align:middle line:90%
is extraterrestrial--

00:24:54.647 --> 00:24:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Well,
it's a Canadian lab.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.202 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and scared the
living daylights out of them?

00:24:59.202 --> 00:25:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I don't think so.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
This is also the same
lab that's doing--

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can't get a
conspiracy out of this, can I?

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Only
because there's--

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want this
to live on forever.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I know, I know.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: Well, we could say,
it's just as much of an alien

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.000 align:middle line:90%
as, perhaps, we all are.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.799 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: You know,
because there is something

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:84%
that we're learning when I
was doing some of the metal

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
forensics that I was
involved with that we've

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.320 align:middle line:90%
talked about before.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We're
not finding exotic

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.980 align:middle line:84%
unheard of elements
when we're dealing

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.280 align:middle line:84%
with these oddities
in the meteorites

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and out in space and the
properties on other planets.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.520 align:middle line:90%
How far would our DNA--

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.320 align:middle line:90%
what would be the--

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Exactly.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: --phenotypic
divergent of human?

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.710 align:middle line:90%
What would that look like?

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Especially if it's true
that they are the makers,

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.730 align:middle line:90%
we were intelligently designed.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I think back on
Steven Greer's Atama--

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah--

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.035 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: --mummy--

00:25:54.035 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --the
little tiny thing.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: --how close--
or just a 3% difference

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:06.402 align:middle line:84%
in the phenotypic and the genome
produced such an odd result.

00:26:06.402 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right,
so let's assume

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:11.260 align:middle line:84%
the DNA testing that you
had done is accurate,

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and this is not an
extraterrestrial by any means.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Does that negate the
possibility that we've

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:84%
been visited from other
extraterrestrial races?

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: Oh, not
at all, not at all.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.692 align:middle line:84%
I think the fact that
we said, it's human,

00:26:25.692 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and we did all this
testing, and we

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:84%
had these credentialed
scientists come and help,

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to
find more and more things,

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:84%
the more digging,
the more cities grow,

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
the more we find
things in caves.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.672 align:middle line:84%
And we need to know how
to do the science right.

00:26:39.672 --> 00:26:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So you think--

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Because some
day, we'll find one.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --something's
out there--

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I absolutely--

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --if we find it.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I absolutely do.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It could be
in Nazca, you know it?

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.995 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:46.995 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I think
it's possible.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We'll find out.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I think
it's possible.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I think, now, with the
availability to science that's

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:84%
coming on board
and participating

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that we have
available to us today,

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.990 align:middle line:90%
we can get those answers.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Those mummies in Nazca
can be identified.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And do we have to worry
about government conspiracy?

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: But we
have to play the game

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.670 align:middle line:90%
of the scientific community.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Which means we have to
follow their protocols exact.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.340 align:middle line:90%
There are no shortcuts.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not doing it right,
they're not going to play ball.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If there--

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.298 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: And I
don't blame them.

00:27:23.298 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If there are government
conspiracies, if there are,

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Why not just come out
and tell us the truth?

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Hey, folks, we've been visited.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:90%
We're being visited.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.410 align:middle line:90%
This is happening.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Why hide it?

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yet, we
have story after story.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:84%
There's more than enough
admissible evidence

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.530 align:middle line:90%
that there is a cover-up.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely a cover-up
of not only extraterrestrials

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.060 align:middle line:84%
but a hybrid race
that was here before.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:49.860 align:middle line:90%

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.180 align:middle line:84%

extraterrestrials here on Earth

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.279 align:middle line:84%
back, way back,
in ancient times.

00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:57.570 align:middle line:90%
There is absolutely a cover-up.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:01.940 align:middle line:84%

our Darwinian theory or--

afraid of though, Chase?

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I think they're
afraid of the truth.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I think they're afraid
of losing power.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.210 align:middle line:84%

should set them free, right?

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:90%
They've had it for so long.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that
the Catholic Church,

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:24.510 align:middle line:84%
when the Conquistadors invaded
Peru or invaded South America

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and decimated the Inca,
where did all that gold go?

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Where did all the riches go?

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:90%

I don't know, really,
what I'm looking at.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.285 align:middle line:10%
But you have done DNA

- Tell us what you've found.

00:29:08.596 --> 00:29:12.530 align:middle line:10%
- This DNA sequence
was made from five

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.550 align:middle line:10%
different molecular
biology laboratories--

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:16.450 align:middle line:10%
- OK.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.782 align:middle line:10%
- --in several
parts of the world.

00:29:18.782 --> 00:29:24.940 align:middle line:10%
And the common results has--

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:10%
the DNA is very similar
to DNA from humans--

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:10%
- Mm-hm.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.210 align:middle line:10%
- --in 98.5% similarity.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:36.210 align:middle line:10%
- Mm-hm.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.390 align:middle line:10%
- It's very strange.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:39.350 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's our
buddy, LA Marzulli.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the winged
object was knocked out

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
of the air by somebody with
a shotgun who fired at them.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But when I was looking
at that, I'm thinking,

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:57.260 align:middle line:84%
might that just have
been an aborted fetus

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:84%
in its developmental stage
or something like that?

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: The-- what
they call the fairy--

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.330 align:middle line:90%
especially in the x-rays--

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.807 align:middle line:84%
see in those little
pieces of metal--

00:30:07.807 --> 00:30:08.765 align:middle line:90%
did look like buckshot.

00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Unfortunately,
George, since then

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:17.450 align:middle line:84%
it has been examined
in a pathological way.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:19.400 align:middle line:90%
So it was opened up.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.390 align:middle line:90%
And it was hoaxed.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No!

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: It was--

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: --a hoax.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.180 align:middle line:84%
However the other
little being, I

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.299 align:middle line:84%
would love to get
my hands on and--

00:30:28.299 --> 00:30:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That could
be a little baby.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I wouldn't know.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.968 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something like that.

00:30:31.968 --> 00:30:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes, but I
absolutely would love--

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well--

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: --to work that one.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk, for
a moment, about people

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:90%
who would hoax things.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing this for?

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, nobody's going
to make a lot of money

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:45.980 align:middle line:90%
on that thing.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.050 align:middle line:90%
Even if you sell it for $100--

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.440 align:middle line:90%
big deal.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Why destroy science
by hoaxing something?

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I wish
I could answer that.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Being a truth-seeker and someone
who loves truth probably more

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.820 align:middle line:84%
than anything else,
other than my free will,

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.595 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure why
somebody would--

00:31:07.595 --> 00:31:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Attention.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: --to
to such trouble.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: It's
[INAUDIBLE] fake.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wanted that
to be a little fairy--

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.420 align:middle line:90%
a real little fairy--

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: I know.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --that, historically,
people have talked about.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Exactly.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.036 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: And it was
so difficult to debunk,

00:31:17.036 --> 00:31:19.090 align:middle line:84%
because every step
led to biology.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.330 align:middle line:90%
It was biological, biological, .

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.131 align:middle line:90%
Because they extracted--

00:31:23.131 --> 00:31:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, they didn't
find buckshot in it though,

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.460 align:middle line:90%
didn't they?

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think
someone shot it just

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.780 align:middle line:90%
to keep the myth going?

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.072 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: For the story?

00:31:32.072 --> 00:31:32.700 align:middle line:90%
A talented [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: I'm not really sure.

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:34.110 align:middle line:90%
I could--

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or they planted it.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes, probably.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would
think a shotgun,

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:84%
on a creature like that,
would have obliterated

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:90%
the poor thing, right?

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would
have blown it up.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So maybe they did just
put little BBs in there and--

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Mmm.

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.129 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: LA has put
out a brand new video.

00:31:49.129 --> 00:31:50.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of his
"Watcher" series?

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:51.628 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Absolutely.

00:31:51.628 --> 00:31:53.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's the last
of his "Watcher" series.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.230 align:middle line:90%
He's moved on.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I've worked very closely
with LA, as you know.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And he completely
tells every detail

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.000 align:middle line:84%
about how they discovered
the hoax at the end.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.142 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How disappointing.

00:32:07.142 --> 00:32:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Right,
but I love that we now

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.880 align:middle line:84%
have a community of
researchers and investigators

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.080 align:middle line:84%
that will expose successful
investigation results.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we see it.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's extraterrestrial,
a hoax, or something

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can determine
that it's a known object,

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:90%
that's a success.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.490 align:middle line:84%
It's successful, because
there are many times we never

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:30.300 align:middle line:90%
get an answer.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: With incredible
scope now of social networking

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.270 align:middle line:90%
and getting news out--

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:41.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when stories break, I
hear about them instantly now.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Even me, being in the
business, sometimes

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.020 align:middle line:90%
didn't hear about it right away.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.025 align:middle line:90%
But now, it's instant.

00:32:47.025 --> 00:32:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's on
your smartphone.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Right.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.925 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You read it
and go, oh my god!

00:32:50.925 --> 00:32:53.820 align:middle line:84%
This happened--
dot-dot-dot-da-da.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.520 align:middle line:90%
What about fake news?

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.065 align:middle line:84%
It travels at the
same rate and speed

00:32:58.065 --> 00:32:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Or faster.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Doesn't that
affect things too?

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:07.000 align:middle line:84%
If somebody put out that that
little creature was real,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:84%
90% of the people who get
it by social networking,

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.540 align:middle line:90%
would believe it.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Right.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's dangerous.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.229 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: Well, they're all
starting to crack down on that.

00:33:15.229 --> 00:33:17.170 align:middle line:84%
YouTube, Facebook,
and Google are all

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:18.460 align:middle line:90%
doing policies right now--

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But how do you know
what's right and what isn't?

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: Well,
that's the sad part.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's Facebook,
YouTube, and Google who

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.570 align:middle line:84%
are saying, they're going
to decide what's fake

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:26.080 align:middle line:90%
and what's not.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If somebody says--

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: And
that's scary for--

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --a UFO landed--

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: --our field.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right, absolutely.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.416 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --and an
extraterrestrial

00:33:30.416 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
was running around and
picked up my dog and left,

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.405 align:middle line:90%
that may be a real story.

00:33:34.405 --> 00:33:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Right.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, but you tell
Facebook that, they'll go, no--

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: I know.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --come on.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.768 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: But that also means,
we need to play their game.

00:33:41.768 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:84%
We need more proof,
more provable proof--

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: --for
them to say, OK--

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.545 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: --we'll put
up there in the ranks.

00:33:49.545 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: The bar is raised.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that I had
some small part in that.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Raising the bar--

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sure you did.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We need
to h it admissibility.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.060 align:middle line:84%
We need to meet a
burden-of-proof.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Our witnesses deserve that.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.380 align:middle line:84%
When we take on
the responsibility

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:08.560 align:middle line:84%
of being an
investigator, we also

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.350 align:middle line:84%
must take the responsibility
to be really good at it.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
needs of the field?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.210 align:middle line:84%
What are the needs of the
reports we're getting?

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, obviously, it's forensics.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.439 align:middle line:84%
How many more lights-in-the-sky
stories do we need?

00:34:20.439 --> 00:34:21.239 align:middle line:90%
We got it.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.489 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We know that there's
many things going on that

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.570 align:middle line:84%
we're not told about
or we don't know,

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.100 align:middle line:90%
whether it's ours or theirs--

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:34.760 align:middle line:84%
secret space program
or extraterrestrial.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.560 align:middle line:90%
We don't need that.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:90%
What we need is probative.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:42.159 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we're going
to outshine the critics.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.440 align:middle line:84%
This is how we're going to
meet that burden-of-proof

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and scrutiny, from not only
science but newsmakers,

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.139 align:middle line:90%
politicians--

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:84%
which I've included in our
agenda, because I'm a lobbyist,

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.650 align:middle line:84%
an official lobbyist with
the State of Georgia--

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:58.900 align:middle line:84%
now have access to
the House and Senate.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.160 align:middle line:90%
What can I do with that?

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.160 align:middle line:84%
How can Kerry and I,
with the field reports,

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.340 align:middle line:84%
start educating properly
and keep them away

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.250 align:middle line:90%
from these fake headlines.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:90%
DNA proves naphthalene.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Never happened.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:16.210 align:middle line:84%
What would Lloyd Pye say to you
today, if he were on the set

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:21.250 align:middle line:84%
with us, after hearing about
the DNA that you just uncovered?

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:26.086 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I would
hope, beyond every--

00:35:26.086 --> 00:35:29.500 align:middle line:84%
(VOICE BREAKING) I would
hope he'd be proud and happy.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's emotional for you.

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:33.389 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:35:33.389 --> 00:35:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I think he'd be happy.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.030 align:middle line:90%
I think he'd be proud.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I think he'd be a little
disappointed that it

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:41.480 align:middle line:90%
wasn't extra-terrestrial.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: We were too.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But he'd be happy
that he got the truth.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We went through
a little grieving process,

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.880 align:middle line:84%
and poor Melanie
more than anyone.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I know, talking
to my producer, Tom Danheiser,

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:84%
that you went through
a period where

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.370 align:middle line:84%
you weren't sure
you really wanted

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:03.120 align:middle line:84%
to tell people what you
had finally discovered,

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.410 align:middle line:90%
in deference to Lloyd.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: But you quickly
came to the realization,

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:84%
no, the right
thing is the truth.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Because I believe
that was his goal always,

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.490 align:middle line:90%
no matter how he believed.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.590 align:middle line:84%
We believed, right
up until the end

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.710 align:middle line:84%
too, that it was
possibly hybrid.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.480 align:middle line:90%
We always maintained that.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.050 align:middle line:90%
And I think, with--

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.080 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I just--

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.565 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, maybe one
day, you'll find that hybrid.

00:36:31.565 --> 00:36:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: I hope so.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:32.635 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: We're looking.

00:36:32.635 --> 00:36:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just keep looking.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.355 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: I hope so.

00:36:34.355 --> 00:36:35.272 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Keep looking.

00:36:35.272 --> 00:36:37.271 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I have a DNA
kit with me pretty much

00:36:37.271 --> 00:36:38.100 align:middle line:90%
everywhere I go.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I hear stories
or run into people,

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm still asking for that DNA--

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.970 align:middle line:90%
still asking for it.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually had two
people take me up on that.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the other thing
that we provided-- this

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.960 align:middle line:84%
isn't all-for-nothing--
was genetic coding

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.220 align:middle line:84%
from 900 years ago
from a group of people.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And we can strengthen
the haplogroup.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:05.400 align:middle line:84%
We can strengthen the
database and the provability.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And any time you're
submitting anomalous-type DNA,

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.710 align:middle line:84%
you're contributing significant
science in the database.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Which is why LA's
team, that I'm part of,

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:22.830 align:middle line:84%
has been invited back to Peru
by the Ministry of Culture

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.110 align:middle line:90%
to actually do DNA sampling.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.947 align:middle line:84%
It's just adding
more and more data,

00:37:27.947 --> 00:37:29.030 align:middle line:90%
which is desperately need.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The more information,
the better off everything is.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.396 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Specifically,
Chase, what

00:37:33.396 --> 00:37:35.400 align:middle line:84%
were the results of
your forensic studies

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.110 align:middle line:90%
on the Starchild project?

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Specifically,
that the Starchild's mother

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:84%
was haplogroup C1 and the dad
was haplogroup Q, which makes

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.940 align:middle line:90%
the Starchild Native American.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And when you
talk about C1 and Q,

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:54.780 align:middle line:90%
exactly what does that mean?

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: C1 is
a Native American--

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bloodline?

00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: It is.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And Q-- 94% of that haplogroup
is found in South America.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.300 align:middle line:84%
What about those, now, who
are skeptical that it's

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.400 align:middle line:90%
human, but still alien?

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.762 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to them?

00:38:12.762 --> 00:38:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: The science
doesn't care what we believe.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:22.080 align:middle line:84%
At this point, everything,
almost every single accusation

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.020 align:middle line:84%
or observation
from the Starchild

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.860 align:middle line:84%
being totally different,
we've answered scientifically

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and through a scientific process
of not just a proclamation

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.870 align:middle line:84%
from one scientist and Kerry
and I said, yep, that's it.

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:40.810 align:middle line:84%
It's repeatable, testable,
with the exact same results.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Which is why the DNA
results that we received

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:84%
were acceptable, because
they were the same results

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.520 align:middle line:90%
of Lloyd's past three.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.230 align:middle line:84%
They're all saying
the same thing.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Does your data--

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:58.892 align:middle line:84%
does your truth destroy what
the UFO community's looking for?

00:38:58.892 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Not at all.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it adds
to a lot of this.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Because every time we have
an investigation like this

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and we dig in scientifically and
do the math and the algorithms

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and the DNA testing
and take care of things

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:84%
at a higher-advantaged
level, we're

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.200 align:middle line:84%
adding more and more
to the community

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.500 align:middle line:84%
on everything else
we investigate.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe that, when
we raised the bar,

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.780 align:middle line:90%
people are going to meet it.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:34.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to start providing
admissible results.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to start meeting
that burden-of-proof.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And our evidence and every
word out of our mouth

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.160 align:middle line:90%
has to be probative.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, it's important
and would pass scrutiny

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:44.490 align:middle line:90%
in a court-of-law.

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What has been
the reaction to your peers

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.200 align:middle line:90%
and from the public to this?

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: It's been
overwhelmingly awesome.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I think people, like us, were
just ready for the truth.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.940 align:middle line:84%
They've waited decades
for science to let us in

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and to learn exactly
what was going on.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:08.250 align:middle line:84%
We have really received
such a small portion

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:10.200 align:middle line:90%
of negative comments.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.544 align:middle line:84%
And truthfully, I think
every comment we've gotten

00:40:12.544 --> 00:40:13.710 align:middle line:90%
that was negative was from--

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.128 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: --a fake account.

00:40:15.128 --> 00:40:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ah, OK.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Which is
why we blogged about--

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's out there.

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: --fake news.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, you got to blog.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
haters out there.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: And they,
obviously, didn't read--

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lot of haters.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: --our report either.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Right, they
couldn't have read the report.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did the report
shock you at all?

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: No, because
it was a process for us.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it would have been
for people that haven't really

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.890 align:middle line:84%
been following it
for a few years,

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:39.630 align:middle line:84%
especially after
Lloyd passing away.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:42.390 align:middle line:90%
We lost-- we lost something.

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure people
were ready for someone else

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.950 align:middle line:90%
to pick up the ball.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:50.049 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: It was another one
of my concerns taking on this

00:40:50.049 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:90%
project--

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:55.590 align:middle line:84%
is, do people even want somebody
else finishing Lloyd's work?

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:59.019 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or just for people
to guess what it could be.

00:40:59.019 --> 00:41:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Right, right.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.950 align:middle line:84%
What was better
for the community?

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.600 align:middle line:84%
It's always going
to be the truth.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did anybody
try to dissuade you?

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.887 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.887 --> 00:41:09.803 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Well, sure.

00:41:09.803 --> 00:41:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Like, experts?

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Or colleagues?

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.648 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Push you back
from doing the research?

00:41:13.648 --> 00:41:15.626 align:middle line:84%
Anybody tried to
talk you out of it?

00:41:15.626 --> 00:41:17.249 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Not really, mm-mm.

00:41:17.249 --> 00:41:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No blowback
on this for you?

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:19.880 align:middle line:90%
For your career?

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: No, I think,
because it's the results.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually surprised
about that, George.

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I was really waiting
for the shoe to fall.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we expected
some blowback.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.375 align:middle line:84%
And we just have
not received it.

00:41:31.375 --> 00:41:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You didn't get it.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
difficult or easy

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to find experts to
conduct the DNA testing?

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I don't know
if it's my approach that's

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:90%
very different.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.790 align:middle line:84%
I've never had trouble finding,
not just experts or scientists

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:51.790 align:middle line:84%
that were mainstream and
legit, but their name

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.310 align:middle line:84%
has to be record or
out to the public.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:84%
They have to have their
name, their profession.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.362 align:middle line:84%
We have to have the
availability to vet and--

00:42:00.362 --> 00:42:01.445 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure, absolutely.

00:42:01.445 --> 00:42:02.903 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE:
--scrutinize the people

00:42:02.903 --> 00:42:04.840 align:middle line:84%
that are making these
claims, especially

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.420 align:middle line:84%
after what happened to
Lloyd after that one.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The legalities
behind the testing

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:13.990 align:middle line:84%
are always very vague, somewhat
difficult. Why is that?

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:16.640 align:middle line:90%


00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Because
the haplogroup

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:23.267 align:middle line:84%
that the Starchild has come
out with is Native American.

00:42:23.267 --> 00:42:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And there are very--

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
stringent rules.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yes.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: Very
stringent rules.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: And nobody was
really willing to tell us

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:31.600 align:middle line:84%
exactly what we
were allowed to do

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.016 align:middle line:84%
and what we weren't
allowed to do.

00:42:33.016 --> 00:42:35.155 align:middle line:84%
So we really spent
months deciding,

00:42:35.155 --> 00:42:37.230 align:middle line:84%
do we even continue
with this DNA testing?

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yes.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: Because there is a
possibility we weren't really

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:41.080 align:middle line:90%
allowed to do that.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's a good point.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: We could
have been arrested.

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, you got it done.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:45.867 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You got it done.

00:42:45.867 --> 00:42:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What drives you, Chase?

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.549 align:middle line:90%
Why do you keep doing this?

00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KLOETZKE: I like to take
corners on two wheels.

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's the adventure.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:54.070 align:middle line:90%
I love this job.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.330 align:middle line:90%
I love the mystery.

00:42:55.330 --> 00:43:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I love solving complex
cases, getting to the truth.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:05.050 align:middle line:90%
I believe that UFOs are real.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:06.630 align:middle line:10%
And the story's not going away.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:10.420 align:middle line:10%
So I hope I'm employed
till the end of my life.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.300 align:middle line:10%
Because as long
as I'm able to, I

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.920 align:middle line:10%
want to rock and roll and
kick down a few more doors.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how
about you, Kerry?

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCLURE: I just want
to find the truth.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.540 align:middle line:10%
I just want this to not
be fringe science either.

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.970 align:middle line:84%
I wish universities
would start looking

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:26.470 align:middle line:90%
into this stuff more and more.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And I want people who
have had experiences--

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.160 align:middle line:84%
like my daughter
had an experience--

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't want them to feel like
they have to keep that quiet.

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:37.300 align:middle line:84%
That's a real thing happening
to thousands of people.

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I just want people to know,
there's something out there.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.890 align:middle line:90%
And I want to know what that is.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, at least
we have the answers now,

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:45.260 align:middle line:90%
at least on this phase of it.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: For this one thing.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.985 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: For this one thing.

00:43:46.985 --> 00:43:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCLURE: Yeah.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Yeah.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So far.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Folks--

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:51.926 align:middle line:90%
>>KLOETZKE: Thank you.

00:43:51.926 --> 00:43:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: --for years, I have
talked with the late Lloyd Pye

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.760 align:middle line:90%
about the Starchild project.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And for years, we've tried
to get the information out

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.150 align:middle line:84%
about whether it is a
hybrid or whether it

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:07.120 align:middle line:84%
is a total extraterrestrial
or whether it's just

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.190 align:middle line:90%
a deformed human being.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, because of the work
of Chase Kloetzke and Kerry

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:17.440 align:middle line:10%
McClure, we have the answer now.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.300 align:middle line:10%
At least we know.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
