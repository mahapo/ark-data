00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:10%
And for years I've interviewed
the man you're about to meet,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:10%
Robert Zubrin, who is the
president of the Mars Society

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:10%
and Pioneer Astronautics,
an organization devoted

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.960 align:middle line:10%
to getting us into space.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.502 align:middle line:84%
Robert, always a
pleasure seeing you.

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.835 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT ZUBRIN: Thanks for
inviting me to come and talk

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:90%
to you again.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have been
fascinated with space

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:90%
since you were a little kid.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.020 align:middle line:84%
What was that one catalyst
that got you really into it?

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: It was Sputnik.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:10%
I was five when Sputnik flew.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Ah.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: And I was
an early reader.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.740 align:middle line:10%
I was already reading
science fiction.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:10%
And while the adults may have
been terrified by Sputnik,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:10%
I was over the top
excited about it.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:10%
Because what it meant
was all these stories

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:10%
I was reading about
the spacefaring future

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:10%
were going to be real.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just got totally into
it and building rockets.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:90%
My dad got me a telescope.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I did drawings of the Moon
through the telescope.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And I learned all
the science I could.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:90%
And I was on board.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we were
going to the Moon by 1970,

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Mars by 1980, Alpha
Centuri by the year 2000.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be part of it.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, we did
realize only the first part

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:90%
of that program.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:90%
We got to the Moon by 1970.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.201 align:middle line:84%
But at exactly that time, and
I was entering college by then,

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:84%
the Nixon administration
slammed on the brakes

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and the Mars
program was aborted.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.680 align:middle line:90%
And all the rest--

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Came a halt.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Came to
a halt. And it was

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
one of the great
disappointments in my life.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And for a while I accepted it
and went and did other stuff.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But at a certain
point I said nah,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.412 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to let this ride.

00:01:59.412 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Had we
kept the pace going

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.344 align:middle line:84%
after we stopped going to the
Moon, but had we kept it up,

00:02:04.344 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
could we have been
to Mars by now?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Oh, Yes.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
NASA had plans for the first
human landing on Mars for 1981.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
If we had kept
going, we would have

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
had a permanent human
settlement on Mars by 1988.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And probably the
first children born on Mars

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:84%
would be graduating high
school on Mars right about now.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we even have a
space program today, Robert?

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Oh yeah, we
have a space program.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:84%
But only parts of
it are functional.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:84%
The robotic planetary
exploration program

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:84%
is quite functional and is
returning exciting results

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:84%
from their various probes
to Mars and Jupiter.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
The space astronomy program is
very functional with the Hubble

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Space Telescope, with the
Kepler Space Telescope.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And this year we may launch
TESS, a new space telescope.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the WEBB
Space Telescope.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:90%
They've got great stuff.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But the human space flight
program is completely adrift.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It's been operating
without meaningful goals

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:84%
basically since
the end of Apollo.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
We have enough
money we're putting

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
into the human
spaceflight program

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
to be sending people
to the Moon and Mars.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
But instead, they're just going
up and down to Earth orbit

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and being used as test subjects
by guinea pig scientists

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:84%
to measure the effects of zero
gravity on human physiology.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:90%
This is just crazy.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Astronauts should not be guinea
pigs, they should be explorers.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, right.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be frustrating
for somebody like you.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah, certainly.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because I mean, you
have developed your career

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:84%
to try to get us to explore and
we're not doing that anymore.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
We need a goal-driven
human spaceflight program.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And the primary goal at this
point should be humans to Mars.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Mars is where the science is.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%
It's where the challenge is.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.580 align:middle line:90%
It's where the future is.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.154 align:middle line:84%
And, I must say, that if we
build a hardware set that

00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
can take us to
Mars, we'll also be

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.944 align:middle line:84%
able to do the Moon and the
near-Earth asteroids as well.

00:03:56.944 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, I
am enthralled though

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:84%
at the privatization
of space right now.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
It seems that these private
companies are coming along

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:90%
like gangbusters.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.253 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, yes.

00:04:07.253 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:90%
They finally are.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
For a while, you
know, in the '80s

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:90%
and the '90s it was just talk.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And to some extent a cop
out for people saying oh,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:90%
we don't need NASA.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Private people will do it.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But starting with Elon Musk
and now with Jeff Bezos,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.870 align:middle line:90%
this stuff is now real.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And Musk, in particular, has
shown that not only can he

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
develop space flight hardware
at one third the cost

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
or 1/10 the cost,
one third the time,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.387 align:middle line:84%
as has become accepted in
the major aerospace industry.

00:04:40.387 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
He's even developed
stuff that they've

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.587 align:middle line:84%
refused to develop ever, such as
reusable spaceflight boosters.

00:04:46.587 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which is amazing.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.836 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes, it's amazing.

00:04:48.836 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:90%
But you know, here's the thing.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.882 align:middle line:84%
The problem wasn't that
they couldn't do it,

00:04:53.882 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:90%
not that they couldn't do it.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.465 align:middle line:84%
The problem was there was no
incentive for them to do it.

00:04:57.465 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Because the contract
model that NASA

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:84%
had put in place with
the major spaceflight

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:90%
contractors was cost plus.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they did, NASA
would pay them plus 10%.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So, they were encouraged
to maintain high costs.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
They were encouraged
to increase overheads.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing to be
gained by not doing so.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Whereas Musk spends
his money like it's

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:84%
his own, because a
significant fraction of it is.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, his goal is to produce
things as cheaply as possible,

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:84%
both the rockets themselves
and now making them reusable.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it make sense
to have a reusable rocket?

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Oh yes, it does.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's only reusing
the first stage,

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:84%
so it's basically going to cut
the cost of launch in half.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:84%
If he can reuse
the second stage,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
then we can talk about
cutting the price of launch

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
by a factor of 10,
and even ultimately

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:90%
by much more than that, by 100.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: I mean--

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Big difference.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And also, and once
you get costs down that low,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
if you have a rocket like
what he has built, OK,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:84%
where the first stage
flies into space

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
but then comes back
to the landing site

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and then the second
stage goes to orbit,

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:84%
if you can go to orbit you can
go halfway around the world

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:90%
just as easily.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So, you're talking about New
York to Sydney in 40 minutes.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So, this is the market
that will ultimately

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.320 align:middle line:90%
lead to cheap spaceflight.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Because you know,
we only you launch

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
about 80 or 90 satellites
a year, worldwide,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.120 align:middle line:90%
the whole world.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Now if it was cheaper,
maybe we'd launch 200.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
But in contrast,
we fly thousands

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.760 align:middle line:84%
of airliners every
day, tens of thousands.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind
of frequency you

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.830 align:middle line:84%
have to have if
we're going to make

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.203 align:middle line:84%
spaceflight as cheap as air
flight and as safe as air

00:06:47.203 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:90%
flight.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:84%
But long-distance surface
to surface is that market.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
these reusable launch

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.826 align:middle line:90%
vehicles will make possible.

00:06:56.826 --> 00:06:59.607 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously impossible with
expendable launch vehicles.

00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, air travel would
be ridiculously expensive

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
if they threw away the
airliner after each flight.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, after
each flight, sure.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.384 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: So, it's got to
be reusable to open that.

00:07:07.384 --> 00:07:09.310 align:middle line:84%
But once you do open
that, then you've

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:84%
got a market thousands of
times bigger than the satellite

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:90%
market.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of the private
guys, Bezos and Musk--

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which one is
doing the better job?

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, at the
moment, Musk is ahead, OK.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.980 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Musk has actually achieved a
flight to orbit numerous times.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.262 align:middle line:90%
He's also developed a capsule.

00:07:30.262 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Bezos has also
developed a capsule.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But Bezos has not
flown to orbit yet.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, Bezos is
much richer than Musk.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:45.185 align:middle line:84%
So, if Musk should falter,
Bezos can keep going.

00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're obviously
doing this, Robert, for money,

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Eventually they want to
make money doing this.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.955 align:middle line:84%
It's not just for
the love of space.

00:07:54.955 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, I actually
disagree with that assessment.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How come?

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, because, I
mean Musk will make money

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:90%
with SpaceX, OK.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But this guy could make money
with a chain of candy stores.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
He could make money
doing anything, OK.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's got
the Midas touch.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes, certainly.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, the question is,
why is he doing SpaceX?

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
It would be much easier,
I mean, you know,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
he could be like Donald Trump
and set up casino hotels, OK.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more money with
that and it's a lot lower risk

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:90%
than trying to build rockets.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've got
hard real estate there.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: And so forth.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.210 align:middle line:90%
Musk wants to change the world.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:90%
Musk-- he's not Mother Theresa.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:84%
He's not a generous
person in a saintly sense.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:49.950 align:middle line:84%
But what he is interested
in is his self-interest

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
is he seeking eternal glory
for doing great deeds.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.164 align:middle line:84%
It's what the ancient
Greeks called kleos.

00:08:57.164 --> 00:08:57.964 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:08:57.964 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: It's why
Achilles killed Hector.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It's you know, that
is what Musk is about.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't just want
to do great deeds.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
He wants eternal glory
for doing great deeds.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's basically
the character trait

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.570 align:middle line:84%
of a person who
wants to be a hero.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.642 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Isn't that
like Jeff Bezos too?

00:09:17.642 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes, as well.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're very similar.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: That's right.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.176 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why
they're doing it.

00:09:23.176 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:10%
I mean, Bezos is going to make
much more money with Amazon

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:10%
than he is with Blue Origin.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So, he's doing this in order
to do something really great.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
He's doing this in
order to do-- you know,

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.170 align:middle line:84%
100 years from now nobody
is going to remember Amazon.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Just like nobody
today remembers what

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.700 align:middle line:90%
were the big companies in 1880.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:90%
But we remember Thomas Edison.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And Henry Ford.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: And Henry Ford.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:58.800 align:middle line:84%
But OK, so there is still a
Motor Company named after Ford.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
But you know, people will
remember Thomas Edison

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
a thousand years from
now, whereas who's

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:84%
going to remember you know,
the Union Pacific Railroad

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.349 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the biggest
railroad was at the time?

00:10:12.349 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you grade
our current administration

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.110 align:middle line:84%
for the possibility of
more space exploration?

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: At this point,
there's no action.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, NASA's on autopilot.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So, the parts of NASA that
were being competently run,

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:84%
which I mentioned
the space astronomy

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.347 align:middle line:84%
program and the robotic
exploration programs,

00:10:32.347 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:84%
they're just kind
of going along doing

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:90%
what they were doing before.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.220 align:middle line:90%
So, that's OK.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, is that
the human spaceflight

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:90%
program is aimless.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.887 align:middle line:84%
So, we're spending,
you know, whatever,

00:10:44.887 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
$10 billion dollars a year,
about half of NASA's budget,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:84%
on the human spaceflight
program and it's not

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:90%
accomplishing anything.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.419 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
accomplish something,

00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:90%
you have to have a goal, OK.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
They just did this thing
where they issued a statement

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
from the White House
saying it's the goal

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
of the American human
spaceflight program

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.742 align:middle line:90%
to establish people on the Moon.

00:11:05.742 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't even
appointed a NASA administrator.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: They haven't asked for
any appropriations for a Moon

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:90%
base program.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's no plan.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.713 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: There's no plan.

00:11:13.713 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:90%
There's no program.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
if this goes on

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:84%
as it's going on, then four
years from now or whenever,

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
what we'll do if
we're sitting here,

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
we'll be talking about
the great accomplishments

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.684 align:middle line:84%
of the Webb Space Telescope
and the TESS Space Telescope.

00:11:35.684 --> 00:11:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be talking about
the great accomplishments

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:90%
of the next Mars Rover.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:84%
But the human
spaceflight program

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
will not have accomplished
anything in the meantime.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, the
PBS program "Space Time"

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.392 align:middle line:84%
talks about a new technology
called him EM Drive.

00:11:50.392 --> 00:11:52.350 align:middle line:10%
>>MATTHEW O'DOWD: The
structure of the EM Drive

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:10%
is a tapered copper
cylinder with two flat ends.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:10%
A resonant radiation
field is induced

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:10%
inside so microwave
standing waves reflecting

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:10%
between the ends.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:10%
The device was invented
by Roger Shawyer in 1999.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:10%
And a couple of similar
proposals followed,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:10%
most notably Guido
Fetta's Cannae Drive.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:10%
These fall under the family
of microwave resonant cavity

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:10%
thrusters.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:10%
They propose that thrust and
net force in one direction,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:10%
the fat end for
the EM Drive, can

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:10%
be achieved by
extracting momentum

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.990 align:middle line:10%
from the internal radiation
field but with no propellants.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:10%
This would be pretty
revolutionary,

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.794 align:middle line:10%
because conventional rocket
engines are fundamentally

00:12:34.794 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:10%
limited by the
fact that they have

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:41.040 align:middle line:10%
to carry not just an energy
source, but propellant,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:10%
a bunch of mass to shoot out the
back end to push them forward.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:10%
The law of conservation
of momentum demands this.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:10%
Roger Shawyer explains the
EM Drive's alleged thrust

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:10%
as resulting from
differential radiation

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.147 align:middle line:10%
pressure between the two ends.

00:12:56.147 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've heard
of this kind of drive?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Uh, yes.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Now OK, there's two
separate issues here.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.100 align:middle line:84%
If you're just talking
about a radiation drive,

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle line:90%
then there's nothing new, OK.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:84%
That is, it's always been known
that electromagnetic radiation

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.750 align:middle line:90%
has momentum.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
It's why solar sails
can get momentum

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.910 align:middle line:90%
by reflecting sunlight.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a radio
transmitter and you have a dish

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're shooting
it in one direction,

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:84%
it will exert some force
in the other direction.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:90%
That is well understood physics.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.180 align:middle line:84%
The issue is that they're
claiming anomalous thrust that

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:84%
is greater than that
amount of thrust, which

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.390 align:middle line:90%
is outside of known physics.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And the problem that I have
is that the experiments that

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:84%
have been done have been
done at such low thrust

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:84%
that the measurement trying to
distinguish between what they

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
claim and what we do
expect to be there

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:84%
is so small that it could be
ascribed to experimental error.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And since there is no
theory that supports

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:90%
the reality of their claims--

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
or no accepted theory,
let me put it that way--

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
at this point, I'm in
a wait and see mode.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not out there
throwing my hat

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:84%
in the air for the EM
Drive, other than what

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:84%
was known always, which was
using electromagnetic radiation

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.312 align:middle line:90%
to create photon pressure.

00:14:29.312 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, do you think
we should go back to the Moon

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:90%
or move on to Mars?

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, I think we
have to set our sights on Mars.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But we don't need to design
gigantic science fiction

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.460 align:middle line:90%
spaceships to go to Mars.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:84%
We can go to Mars with
essentially the same kind

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.864 align:middle line:84%
of transportation
system that you

00:14:48.864 --> 00:14:50.030 align:middle line:90%
could use to go to the Moon.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Which means a
heavy lift booster,

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:84%
something that could throw
perhaps 50 tons on Trans-Mars

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.475 align:middle line:90%
or trans-lunar injection.

00:14:56.475 --> 00:14:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How long is the trip?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, to the
Moon is three days,

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
to Mars is six months.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Six months.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:90%
And either way is doable.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:90%
But the thing is this.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you design a
coherent Moon-Mars program.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:84%
You design a Moon
mission, not with

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.430 align:middle line:84%
the absolute minimum capability
for getting to the Moon,

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:84%
but with a healthy capability
of getting to the Moon

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.150 align:middle line:90%
like we had with Apollo.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you constrain
the Mars mission

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:84%
to operate within
the performance

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.390 align:middle line:90%
envelope of that capability.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we go to Mars
and it takes six months

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.457 align:middle line:84%
to go, how long would we
stay before we'd come back?

00:15:35.457 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, the
flight plan that I

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
prefer is six months out, six
months back, a year and a half

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:90%
on the surface in between.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A year and a half?

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, in other words,
the cycle is two and 1/2 years.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And I would prefer to
spend the majority of it

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.120 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of Mars, because
that is where the science is.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
mission is about.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:84%
The mission is, you know,
not about spending time

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:90%
flying through space.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:84%
It's about doing
exploration on Mars.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So, you could spend nine months
going and nine months coming

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:84%
back, and then you'd be
a year on the surface.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But I'd rather spend
60% of the mission time

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:90%
on the surface than 40%.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's see how
NASA's plan for going to Mars

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.280 align:middle line:90%
could evolve.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.310 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: NASA's path for
human exploration of Mars

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:10%
begins in low earth orbit
aboard the International Space

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:10%
Station.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:10%
On board the
orbiting laboratory,

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:10%
astronauts are helping us
prove many of the technologies

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.060 align:middle line:10%
and communications systems
needed for human missions

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.875 align:middle line:10%
into deep space.

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:10%
>>CHARLES BOLDEN:
Well, the crews

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.083 align:middle line:10%
right now on the
International Space Station

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:10%
are using this wonderful
outpost to help

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.380 align:middle line:10%
us get farther and farther into
space, to asteroids, to Mars

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:10%
eventually.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I think the science
on Station is

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
making incredible
breakthroughs that

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
are going to help us make life
better for people right here

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.394 align:middle line:10%
>>RICK MASTACCHIO: We and our
other international partner

00:16:54.394 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:10%
crewmates are working off
the planet for the planet.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.620 align:middle line:10%
>>MIKE HOPKINS: NASA, along
with our international partners,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:10%
conduct scientific research
every day here on the Station

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:10%
as we use this
orbiting laboratory

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.450 align:middle line:10%
as a stepping stone for
future deep space exploration.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NARRATOR: In tandem with
Space Station research,

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:10%
NASA will send a robotic
mission to capture and redirect

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.170 align:middle line:10%
an asteroid to orbit the Moon.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:10%
Astronauts aboard
NASA's Orion spacecraft

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:10%
will explore the asteroid and
return to earth with samples.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:10%
This experience will help
NASA test new systems

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:10%
and capabilities such as solar
electric propulsion, which

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:10%
will send cargo as part
of human missions to Mars.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.050 align:middle line:10%
NASA's new space
launch system will

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.855 align:middle line:10%
enable these proving
ground missions

00:17:47.855 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:10%
to test new capabilities.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:10%
Human missions to Mars will rely
on Orion and an evolved version

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:10%
of SLS, which will be the most
powerful rocket ever flown.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, how close are
we to doing things like that?

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, that's
actually a pretty funny movie.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I noticed
a little chuckle.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, yeah, no.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Because all right,
the first part of it

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:90%
had some truth in it.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:84%
We certainly have learned stuff
on the Space Station that will

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:90%
be useful in going to Mars.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:84%
But you know, if you are going
to have a nautical program

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.410 align:middle line:84%
of sea exploration, you might
very well have a training ship

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:84%
that you moor out in
the harbor or in the bay

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:90%
that you send the cadets on.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You should.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, you should.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:84%
But that would not be the
sum total or centerpiece

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:90%
of your program.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
That would be just sort
of one facility that

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:90%
helps support the program.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the show
was nonsensical.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.070 align:middle line:84%
For instance, this
thing about capturing

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
a chunk of an asteroid and
putting it in lunar orbit.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
That has nothing to do with
sending people to Mars.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that
idea, which was popular

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
when this film was
made about a year ago,

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.094 align:middle line:90%
has already been dropped, OK.

00:19:04.094 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:84%
This idea of capturing a boulder
and putting a lunar orbit

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.379 align:middle line:84%
is completely irrelevant
to humans to Mars.

00:19:08.379 --> 00:19:10.170 align:middle line:84%
No one interested in
sending humans to Mars

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:84%
would ever have come
up with such an idea.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.261 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: It was an idea that
they came up with for something

00:19:15.261 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they
attempted to justify it

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
by saying it's part of the
human Mars mission program.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:84%
It's similarly the solar
electric propulsion,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
which is something that
there's a faction in NASA that

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:90%
wants to do it.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
We don't need it to
send humans to Mars.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.590 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't use it to send
humans to Mars if I had it.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And once again, it's just that
all these separate programs are

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:84%
being justified
or rather they are

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.710 align:middle line:84%
being supported by
different constituencies out

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:46.870 align:middle line:90%
of their self-interest.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they justify
them by saying oh, this

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.860 align:middle line:90%
is needed if you go to Mars.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
problem with NASA

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:84%
right now, in particular the
human space flight program.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
They are not spending
money to do things.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.607 align:middle line:84%
They are doing things
in order to spend money.

00:20:04.607 --> 00:20:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's not smart.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: No, it's like
running your business

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:90%
to make your vendors happy.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if you're
running a business,

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:90%
you do buy things from vendors.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But you do that
for your purposes.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:84%
You don't do things
in order to say

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:90%
hi vendors, Merry Christmas.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We've decided to do
something to make you happy.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So, what's needed is for NASA
to say OK, here's the mission.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:90%
It's humans to Mars.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.080 align:middle line:90%
What do we need to do that?

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:90%
And then you do those things.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Since this movie was
composed, they've

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.280 align:middle line:84%
come up with a new
hobby horse, which

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.130 align:middle line:84%
is to put a space
station in lunar orbit,

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:84%
supposedly because we need
in order to go to Mars.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:84%
We do not need a space station
in lunar orbit to go to Mars.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that the Trump
administration's plan?

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, actually, it
was the last gasp of the Obama

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:84%
administration, but it
hasn't been abandoned yet.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, at this point
that's still the program

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:84%
that they're claiming
is necessary, probably

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
because there is not yet a NASA
administrator to throw it out.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sounds like
a waste of money.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:90%
It's literally a waste of money.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:90%
That is its purpose.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you don't need
a space station in lunar orbit

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:90%
to go to Mars.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.263 align:middle line:84%
You don't even need a space
station in lunar orbit

00:21:26.263 --> 00:21:27.347 align:middle line:90%
to go to the Moon.

00:21:27.347 --> 00:21:29.430 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go to the
Moon, you go to the Moon.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: From here.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Bang.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.690 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go to
Mars, you go to Mars.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, what we need
is a mission driven program.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the way to
think about it is--

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.093 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And what
do you mean by that?

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well OK, let's
think of two couples.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And they each want
a dream house, OK.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.869 align:middle line:84%
Now couple number one, they
sit down, they talk it over,

00:21:50.869 --> 00:21:53.160 align:middle line:84%
they get a general idea what
the dream house should be.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:90%
They bring an architect over.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.814 align:middle line:84%
And over the kitchen
table he sketches it out.

00:21:56.814 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And they say ah,
that's the house.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.656 align:middle line:84%
And then they bring
in an engineer

00:21:59.656 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:90%
and he actually designs it.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.407 align:middle line:84%
And then they build
that house, OK.

00:22:03.407 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a mission driven program.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:90%
That's Apollo.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, couple number two
spends their weekends

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
cruising garage sales
and they randomly

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.640 align:middle line:84%
buy house parts that fit
their fancy at that moment.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you know, a spiral
staircase would be cool.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:90%
How about some Doric columns?

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a fountain with a statue
of Napoleon in the middle?

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, and they accumulate all
this junk in their backyard.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they invite
the in-laws over.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And then pa-in-law says to
son-in-law, why do you have

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.289 align:middle line:90%
all this junk in your backyard?

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, it's
to build our dream house.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And pa-in-law says, I'd like to
see the plans for this house.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And so, they say OK,
well, we'll show you the plans.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So, they call an architect
and they say look,

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.870 align:middle line:84%
we want you to design
a house and it has

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:90%
to include all of these parts.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.456 align:middle line:84%
And so, you get a crazy plan
which is never implemented.

00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You have parts
you don't even need, right.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: No.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But well, you do
need in order to show

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
to pa-in-law as your
excuse of why you made

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.440 align:middle line:90%
all these random purchases.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what that plan
that you just saw was.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.292 align:middle line:84%
You have an assortment
of random programs.

00:23:09.292 --> 00:23:10.500 align:middle line:90%
You've got the Doric columns.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.708 align:middle line:90%
You got the spiral staircase.

00:23:11.708 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
statue of Napoleon

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.980 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of a fountain.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And there is the
architect who has designed

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:84%
a house that includes
all those things

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and says this is
the dream house.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And the house will never
be built, because it

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:90%
doesn't fit together, OK.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't matter.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole point
of the design was to get

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:31.367 align:middle line:90%
pa-in-law off your back.

00:23:31.367 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to beat us
to Mars if we don't go?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.240 align:middle line:90%
China?

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, I'm hoping
that it will be SpaceX

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:90%
rather than a foreign entity.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's possible.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's very possible.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, although I
mean, my vision right now

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
is that eventually
SpaceX and Blue Origin

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and maybe someone
else who comes along

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:84%
will create enough
of the systems

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
that we need to go to Mars that
somebody will then sit down

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.170 align:middle line:84%
with a president, whoever he
or she may be at that time,

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and say look, we have
practically everything we need.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.096 align:middle line:84%
If you commit the
nation to go to Mars,

00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:11.136 align:middle line:84%
we could be there by the
end of your second term.

00:24:11.136 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:90%
How about it?

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And at that point it's an
easy sell and we do it.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
Musk is looking for too.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.410 align:middle line:84%
He's looking for being paid
to send people to Mars.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: He's investing by
creating the systems to do it

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:90%
in advance.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.067 align:middle line:84%
But if they don't rise
to that, or I mean,

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:90%
let's say Musk could fail.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Musk has got a very
important launch coming up

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.140 align:middle line:90%
in March.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:10%
He's going to launch the
TESS Space Telescope.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.476 align:middle line:10%
This is the first
time that SpaceX

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:10%
has been asked to
launch something

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.737 align:middle line:10%
that's really important.

00:24:40.737 --> 00:24:42.320 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And that
he's got to deliver.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.695 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: And the
public is going

00:24:43.695 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:10%
to be really unhappy
if that launch fails,

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.430 align:middle line:10%
if he loses a space
telescope, OK, boom.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: That took
years to make, right?

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes,
absolutely, a decade.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: A decade?

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:01.440 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes, between the
design and convincing NASA

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:10%
to fund it and so forth, yes.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.440 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people have put most of
their careers into this thing.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:10%
But it's not just about
them, it's about us.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:10%
This is the great planet
finding telescope.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:10%
It's going to find planets
orbiting other stars.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Kepler Space
Telescope has shown the way,

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:84%
but this is going to be
thousands of times more

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.380 align:middle line:90%
effective than Kepler.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.950 align:middle line:10%
This is a grand telescope
comparable in its value

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:23.850 align:middle line:10%
to Hubble.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:10%
And SpaceX is being
asked to launch it.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:10%
They're in the big
time with this one.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.270 align:middle line:10%
So, may we have a
drumroll, please.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.600 align:middle line:10%
OK, if they succeed,
they'll be the great heroes.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:84%
If they fail, people are going
to want to shut them down.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's that,
and then they're

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.676 align:middle line:84%
going to be asked
to launch things

00:25:41.676 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:90%
more important after that.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:90%
And they could fail.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
high-risk business.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And who knows, if Blue Origin,
when it starts actually

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:52.470 align:middle line:84%
launching rockets
has some failures,

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
they could be out of
business, although they

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.780 align:middle line:84%
have more resiliency because
Bezos has more money.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:84%
But you know, if
they fail, then--

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Could be ego.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well--

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Between them.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, yeah, but
what I'm saying is well,

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:84%
first of all, one very positive
result of Musk's activity

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
has not just been
his own activity,

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:84%
but the fact that he's
shown us a private space

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.902 align:middle line:90%
company that works is possible.

00:26:22.902 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Very possible.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And so, we're
going to see more SpaceXs.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.361 align:middle line:84%
Blue Origin, of course,
we've already seen.

00:26:27.361 --> 00:26:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to see
more American SpaceXs.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
European SpaceX.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
Russian SpaceXs.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
Chinese SpaceXs.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.127 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Saudis?

00:26:36.127 --> 00:26:37.210 align:middle line:90%
They got the money for it.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Maybe.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.200 align:middle line:84%
But they don't really have
the technical expertise.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They could buy it.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah, but--

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Japan?

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes, Japan, certainly.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Japan, India.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to have a
certain scientific outlook

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.240 align:middle line:90%
in order to do this.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not just money, OK.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean there's a reason
why this happened first

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.620 align:middle line:84%
There's other countries where
there's big pools of capital

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:90%
laying around.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But America also
has the know-how.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:06.490 align:middle line:90%
It's got the creativity.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.262 align:middle line:90%
It's got the ingenuity.

00:27:08.262 --> 00:27:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the drive.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: And the drive.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.250 align:middle line:10%
Now I've been to Russia
a number of times,

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:10%
and I happen to know that
there are groups over there

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:17.740 align:middle line:10%
right now who are trying to
pull together a Russian SpaceX.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.620 align:middle line:10%
And there are pools
of capital there owned

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:10%
by people who have a
passionate interest in space.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:84%
The real question though
is what guarantees can they

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.080 align:middle line:84%
get from the Putin regime
that if they build a company

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.280 align:middle line:90%
it won't just be stolen?

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, it could be.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: And it could be.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.468 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He'll nationalize it

00:27:33.468 --> 00:27:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: So, in fact,
the kleptocracy in Russia

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:40.030 align:middle line:84%
is actually impairing it
from having its own SpaceX.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
unless they reform,

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.500 align:middle line:84%
it will impair their
national defense,

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.330 align:middle line:84%
because space is a
very important part

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:90%
of national defense right now.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So, the Russians,
the Putin regime

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:55.630 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
faced with a choice.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.872 align:middle line:84%
If you want Russia
to remain strong,

00:27:57.872 --> 00:27:59.830 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to
provide some guarantees

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.260 align:middle line:84%
for private property
and individual rights.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For years you have
been a proponent to get to Mars.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:90%
You don't give up.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: No one ever
won by giving up.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But why do you
want to go to Mars, Robert?

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Why do I want
to see people on Mars?

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.420 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: Because at one point
in my life, me going to Mars

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.519 align:middle line:10%
was a real possibility.

00:28:24.519 --> 00:28:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that's
realistic at this point.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm already 65.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.480 align:middle line:90%
We've wasted too much time.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But if I can have a significant
part in helping make it happen,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:90%
that's good enough for me.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.924 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
the most important thing

00:28:41.924 --> 00:28:43.090 align:middle line:90%
going on in the world right.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:44.089 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is exciting.

00:28:44.089 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, I mean
look, think about this.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:90%
What happened in 1492?

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mr. Columbus.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.550 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.160 align:middle line:90%
And any American would say that.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing
we remember from 1492.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But other things
happened in 1492

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:90%
that were the big headliners.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:84%
The Borgias took over
the Papacy in 1492.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.420 align:middle line:90%
That was the big coup.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That was a big story.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, Lorenzo
de Medici died in 1492.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.010 align:middle line:84%
England and France signed
a peace treaty in 1492.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:15.040 align:middle line:84%
If there had been big
time newspapers and 1492,

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.040 align:middle line:84%
those would have
been the big stories,

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.280 align:middle line:84%
not this Italian weaver's son
taking three little boats off

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:90%
into the ocean.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:90%
And you know, what's that about?

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, in 1903
the Wright brothers flew

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:90%
the first airplane?

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:90%
Who was Secretary of State?

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:34.230 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nobody knows.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, you know.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:90%
None of that stuff matters.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So, you only have a
certain time on Earth here.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.820 align:middle line:84%
You want to do
something that matters.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
500 years from now I
believe that if we're

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.610 align:middle line:84%
successful in turning
humanity into a spacefaring

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:84%
species, if we do
our job, which is

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to have that first
little Plymouth Rock

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.005 align:middle line:84%
settlement on Mars, 500
years now not only will there

00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:01.660 align:middle line:84%
be new branches of human
civilization on Mars,

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
but on thousands of planets
orbiting thousands of stars

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:84%
in this neighborhood
of the galaxy.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And when they look
back on this time, what

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.640 align:middle line:90%
are they going to care about?

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Will they care about
which gang of murderers

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.920 align:middle line:90%
came out on top in Syria?

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Will they care about
who was in and who

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.760 align:middle line:84%
was out and this and
that the other thing?

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, who's going
to remember Rex Tillerson?

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, hello.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:84%
But what we did to make their
grant civilization possible,

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:90%
that's what will matter.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People still
remember Neil Armstrong.

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah, they still
remember Neil Armstrong.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.378 align:middle line:90%
They still remember Columbus.

00:30:39.378 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:90%
It's 500 years ago.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And 500
years from now,

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.440 align:middle line:84%
we may have gone to the
Moon to beat the Soviet

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Union to the Moon.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.100 align:middle line:84%
500 years from now, they'll
remember Neil Armstrong,

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.550 align:middle line:84%
but only history buffs will even
know what the Soviet Union was.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And who will
remember the candidates who

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.110 align:middle line:90%
want to go to Mars permanently?

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.600 align:middle line:10%
>>REPORTER: Mars One has
just taken another step

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:07.220 align:middle line:10%
to bring mankind where it
has never stepped before.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.910 align:middle line:10%
Meet the Mars 100.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:10%
Just 100 candidates now
remain in a competition

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.364 align:middle line:10%
for a seat on a one way
trip to the red planet.

00:31:15.364 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:10%
>>ZACHARY GALLEGOS:
I want to go to Mars

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.424 align:middle line:10%
not just to be a
part of history,

00:31:18.424 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:10%
but to inspire people
around the world.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REPORTER: Initially,
more than 200,000

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.630 align:middle line:10%
applied for the Mars One
astronaut selection program

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.640 align:middle line:10%
from all over the world.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.480 align:middle line:10%
About a year ago, that number
narrowed to about 1,000.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.022 align:middle line:10%
That's when we first
met six of them.

00:31:33.022 --> 00:31:34.854 align:middle line:10%
>>LEILA ZUCKER: I've
wanted to go into space

00:31:34.854 --> 00:31:36.220 align:middle line:10%
since I was three years old.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:10%
>>REPORTER: Out of
this group, just two

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.150 align:middle line:10%
advanced to the final 100.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:10%
Leila Zucker, a married
46-year-old ER doctor

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.581 align:middle line:10%
from Washington DC
who is well, excited.

00:31:46.581 --> 00:31:48.580 align:middle line:10%
>>LEILA ZUCKER: Spaceship,
spaceship, spaceship!

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:52.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REPORTER: And Daniel Carey,
a 53-year-old data architect

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.850 align:middle line:10%
from Virginia, husband
and father of two.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.160 align:middle line:10%
>>DANIEL CAREY: The whole
impact and possibility

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.230 align:middle line:10%
becomes a lot more
real and sharp

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.540 align:middle line:10%
as the numbers get smaller.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.902 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
people serious?

00:32:03.902 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Um,
well, I don't think

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.580 align:middle line:84%
that Mars One is going to
succeed in sending people

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.836 align:middle line:84%
to Mars because they don't
have the financial resources.

00:32:12.836 --> 00:32:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: To get them there.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.918 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: That's right.

00:32:14.918 --> 00:32:18.490 align:middle line:84%
But they did inspire
a lot of people

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.920 align:middle line:84%
with the visions of
human settlement of Mars.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And I've met a fair number
of these Mars One final 100.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them are
very credible people.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I would say of that
final 100, 20 or 30

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:84%
would absolutely be qualified
to make the NASA astronaut core.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You'd feel honored
to send them, wouldn't you.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:38.468 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: That's right.

00:32:38.468 --> 00:32:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And we had two of them
actually participate

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.440 align:middle line:84%
in the Mars Society's recent
expedition to the Arctic

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.900 align:middle line:84%
where we did a simulated
Mars mission up there.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:33:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So, no, you know, Mars One
is visionary in the sense

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that Bas Lansdorp does not
have the resources to make

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.180 align:middle line:90%
it happen.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that the idea of
a privately funded Mars colony

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:90%
is possible.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I do think that sending
people to Mars one-way

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.820 align:middle line:90%
to create a colony is possible.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Colonization is a one-way trip.

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Life's a one way trip.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think it
would take someone

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:84%
with more resources and personal
connections and other things

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:90%
to make it work.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Just like there
were a lot of people

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.950 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to start
their own space launch

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:37.915 align:middle line:90%
company before SpaceX.

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Right, but they
didn't have the resources.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.748 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: They didn't
have the resources.

00:33:41.748 --> 00:33:43.335 align:middle line:84%
Musk was the first
one who really did.

00:33:43.335 --> 00:33:44.135 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:33:44.135 --> 00:33:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And so, he's
laid out a vision.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:84%
He's created a dream,
just like the people

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:57.540 align:middle line:84%
who created the dream of the
private space launch company.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.590 align:middle line:90%
They tried.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:59.700 align:middle line:90%
They failed.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:06.250 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, you know, Elon
Musk saw that and he said,

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:07.190 align:middle line:90%
I could do this.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.410 align:middle line:90%
And did it.

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do we find
if we go to Mars, Robert?

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.440 align:middle line:90%
What do we really find?

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.460 align:middle line:90%
Do we see a past civilization?

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.739 align:middle line:90%
What do we find?

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, we find--

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.717 align:middle line:84%
OK, first of all, there's
two different things

00:34:18.717 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that have to do with
Mars and they both bear

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:21.900 align:middle line:90%
on the question of life.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.490 align:middle line:84%
One is life in the past and the
other is life in the future.

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:25.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, in terms of
life in the past,

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, Mars was once a
warm and wet planet.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.949 align:middle line:90%
It could have evolved life.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:36.090 align:middle line:10%
Mars was warm and wet 3
and 1/2 billion years ago

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:39.238 align:middle line:10%
at the same time that
life appeared on Earth.

00:34:39.238 --> 00:34:40.154 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:34:40.154 --> 00:34:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, now
the question is this.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Did life appear on Mars?

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And if so, did it
appear indigenously

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and then come to Earth by
natural transfer of material

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:53.931 align:middle line:90%
by meteoric impact?

00:34:53.931 --> 00:34:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A meteor, sure.

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:56.969 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Did it appear
because life from Earth

00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
came and colonized Mars
through the same process?

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Did we get two separate origins?

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Or were we both colonized
from the outside?

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.744 align:middle line:84%
And we can resolve
this by going to Mars.

00:35:12.744 --> 00:35:13.910 align:middle line:90%
See, there's a real mystery.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they're
all possible.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes,
they're all possible.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
any proof right now.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:24.020 align:middle line:84%
The one thing we do
know is that there's

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.510 align:middle line:84%
something very suspicious
about life on Earth,

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.750 align:middle line:84%
which is that it appears
virtually as soon as it could.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.790 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the planet
cooled enough to have

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:35.390 align:middle line:84%
liquid water almost
immediately life appears.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You find that unusual?

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well,
that is suggesting

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that it was kind of
around and waiting

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to drop and start as soon
as the place became livable.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe it was ongoing.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, yeah.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.660 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, but
that is one thing.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that's
suspicious about life on Earth

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:59.750 align:middle line:84%
is we don't find any
what I call pre-bacteria.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:84%
That is, we don't find any
evidence of free living

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.270 align:middle line:84%
organisms on Earth
simpler than bacteria.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Now, you
think about this.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, OK, you think
about an iPhone.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.240 align:middle line:90%
An iPhone is a machine.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.680 align:middle line:84%
But there's all sorts of
technologies that proceed it.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.230 align:middle line:84%
There's computers, there's
electricity, there's batteries,

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:90%
there's glass, there's steel.

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.450 align:middle line:90%
There's all these things.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:29.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole technological
history behind the iPhone, OK.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, so, we can believe
that the iPhone was invented

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:84%
by earthlings because they
invented all this stuff that

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:90%
led up to it.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:45.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, but what if this was the
prehistoric age and people

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.910 align:middle line:84%
had no technologies
beyond stone axes

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden somebody
shows up with an iPhone.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, you would suspect
that must have then came

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.120 align:middle line:90%
from the outside.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Had to.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, right.

00:36:55.870 --> 00:37:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, so bacteria may seem
simple compared to big animals

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.370 align:middle line:90%
and plants and people.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.870 align:middle line:84%
But they're really
very complicated.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.900 align:middle line:84%
They've got all sorts of
extremely complicated systems

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:08.700 align:middle line:90%
and subsystems.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And they got a whole language
of information technology

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:84%
in them, DNA, and
RNA and all of this.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's all there.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.410 align:middle line:84%
There had to have been
a prior evolution.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.290 align:middle line:84%
We find no evidence
of it on Earth.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:26.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, if we go
to Mars and let's

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:84%
say we find bacteria similar to
Earth bacteria, but also more

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.140 align:middle line:90%
primitive organisms.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So we could see the evolutionary
history from chemistry to life,

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.270 align:middle line:84%
then we'd say, well
life evolved on Mars

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:43.110 align:middle line:90%
and then it came to the Earth.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:84%
If we were to go to Mars and
find a totally different kind

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.870 align:middle line:84%
of organism that didn't use
DNA and RNA for information,

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:56.100 align:middle line:84%
then we'd say whoa,
that's a local evolution

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:90%
different than Earth evolution.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And gee, if it could happen
there, it could happen here.

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.828 align:middle line:84%
And I guess maybe
the bacteria just

00:38:01.828 --> 00:38:05.640 align:middle line:84%
wiped out their more primitive
ancestors or something, OK.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Because this shows that
life could evolve commonly.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.720 align:middle line:84%
If, on the other hand,
we find only bacteria

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.150 align:middle line:84%
of more or less the same
kind that we have here

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and no pre-bacteria,
that can indicate

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.860 align:middle line:84%
the both Earth and Mars were
seeded from the outside.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
a dramatic story.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Right.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Panspermia?

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And if
Earth-- yes, panspermia.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And if Earth and Mars were
seeded from the outside,

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that means all solar systems are
being seeded from the outside.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It means the universe
is filled with life.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think Mars
might have had intelligent life?

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: No, I actually
don't think that.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could be
wrong about that.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But the kind of Mars
that we see today

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:52.350 align:middle line:84%
would not support an
abundant biosphere,

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.640 align:middle line:84%
let alone an intelligent
civilization.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.867 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do believe that Mars
will host intelligent life.

00:38:58.867 --> 00:39:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I believe when people
go to Mars we're

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:84%
going to make Mars
much more habitable.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have a
plan to terraform it.

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
will terraform it.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we're a life, and
it's the nature of life

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.800 align:middle line:84%
to take barren environments
and transform them into places

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that are friendly for
the development of life.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Life has radically
terraformed the Earth.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.230 align:middle line:84%
The early Earth
resembled the early Mars

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:27.640 align:middle line:84%
with the CO2 atmosphere
and so forth and no soil.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.090 align:middle line:84%
It's life that has put
oxygen in our atmosphere.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:84%
It's life that put
soil on the continents.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.520 align:middle line:84%
It's life, clearly,
that made Earth green.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And no sooner does any
barren place appear on Earth,

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.480 align:middle line:84%
like Hawaii coming out
of the Pacific Ocean,

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.861 align:middle line:84%
this huge piece of
bare, sterile basalt--

00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:46.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And lifting it's way.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:47.818 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: --then birds
fly over, and they

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:49.740 align:middle line:84%
drop seeds and the
place becomes lush.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.086 align:middle line:84%
And then Polynesians show
up and let loose pigs

00:39:52.086 --> 00:39:53.460 align:middle line:84%
so there's something
good to eat.

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And then Europeans show
up and build hotels

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.330 align:middle line:84%
so there's a nice
place to check in.

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:59.550 align:middle line:90%
This is what we do.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And it would be unnatural
if human beings was

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.580 align:middle line:84%
the kind of bird, as it were,
that the biosphere has evolved

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.340 align:middle line:84%
to take the seeds of
life and transport them

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.220 align:middle line:84%
to currently barren
islands across space

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.710 align:middle line:90%
did not do exactly that.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.710 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to do it.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:14.220 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do it.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.330 align:middle line:90%
We're going to make--

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:17.280 align:middle line:84%
we're not just going
to bring life to Mars,

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.400 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
bring Mars to life.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.649 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Will it be government
or these private sector

00:40:20.649 --> 00:40:21.690 align:middle line:90%
companies?

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, I
think initially it's

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:25.900 align:middle line:84%
going to be a
combination of both.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, I mean look,
look, frankly, SpaceX

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:29.790 align:middle line:90%
is a combination of both.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.002 align:middle line:84%
It was started by Musk
with his own money.

00:40:32.002 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, I
think about half the money

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.430 align:middle line:84%
coming into SpaceX is
from the government.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.090 align:middle line:84%
I think the first
human missions to Mars

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:43.650 align:middle line:84%
will be done with a significant
role by SpaceX hardware.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.900 align:middle line:84%
SpaceX is going to make
the mission a lot cheaper

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.480 align:middle line:90%
for the American people to do.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But the government
is still going

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.620 align:middle line:84%
to have to foot
part of the bill.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's like Lewis and Clark.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, they were funded
by the US government.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.229 align:middle line:84%
But once they did it,
they went across America

00:40:59.229 --> 00:41:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and they found how you
could cross America.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They were on their own.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.631 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: And that there
were resources out there

00:41:03.631 --> 00:41:04.710 align:middle line:90%
on the Pacific coast.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Then the wagon trains
started rolling.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: So, the
government had a role

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:11.516 align:middle line:90%
in the settling of the West.

00:41:11.516 --> 00:41:13.320 align:middle line:90%
They helped opened it up.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.260 align:middle line:84%
They established
the cavalry forts.

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.750 align:middle line:84%
They gave land grants for
the railroads and so forth.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:24.620 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, then
they made it possible

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.462 align:middle line:84%
and then private
individuals did it.

00:41:26.462 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some scientists
think that there

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:32.790 align:middle line:84%
could have been a nuclear
holocaust, a war on Mars.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: I don't think there
was a nuclear war on Mars,

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.160 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think there was
a technological civilization

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.990 align:middle line:90%
on Mars.

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
there's ever going

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.120 align:middle line:84%
to be a nuclear
war on Mars, even

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.730 align:middle line:84%
though I think there will be
a technological civilization

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:90%
on Mars.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Because I think--

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It will be us.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, I think
as humanity matures,

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.160 align:middle line:84%
we go out to space,
what we're going

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to do by going out into
space is prove that there are

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:04.980 align:middle line:84%
infinite number of
resources, that there

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.990 align:middle line:90%
is no need to have wars.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Because it is people
that are resourceful.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And if we can turn Mars
into a living world

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:17.210 align:middle line:84%
we can turn innumerable
worlds into living worlds.

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If we go to Mars
for any length of time,

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.650 align:middle line:90%
what will we do there?

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.050 align:middle line:90%
What will we build?

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, if we
go to Mars to settle,

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.540 align:middle line:84%
the first thing we
need to do is learn

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:32.780 align:middle line:84%
how to take Martian
materials and turn them

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.831 align:middle line:90%
into resources, OK.

00:42:35.831 --> 00:42:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Including the
water that's there.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:38.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.900 align:middle line:84%
See look, there really
is no such thing

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:90%
as a natural resource.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.190 align:middle line:84%
There's only natural
raw materials.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Land was not a resource until
people learned how to farm.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.620 align:middle line:84%
It is farming that turns
to land from simply space

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that you have to travel over
into a resource in itself.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: OK, petroleum
was underground,

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.910 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't a resource until
we learned how to drill for it

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.180 align:middle line:84%
and refine it and make machines
that could use the product.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Uranium was not a
resource until we learned

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.510 align:middle line:90%
how to do nuclear energy.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:16.490 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts
of stuff on Mars.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But it won't be resources
until people go there,

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.330 align:middle line:84%
because it is people
who are resourceful.

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And now we go there, we'll
learn how to extract water

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.157 align:middle line:90%
from the Martian surface.

00:43:28.157 --> 00:43:29.990 align:middle line:84%
We'll learn how to
extract geothermal energy

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:31.790 align:middle line:90%
from the Martian subsurface.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:33.920 align:middle line:84%
We'll learn how to
grow crops on Mars.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.100 align:middle line:84%
We'll learn how to make not
only fuel and oxygen, which

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.110 align:middle line:84%
is part of my own
Mars Direct plan,

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:44.630 align:middle line:84%
but plastics, growing
food, of course,

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:46.384 align:middle line:84%
fabrics, metals,
plastics, wires--

00:43:46.384 --> 00:43:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It will be
a mini planet Earth.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: --tubes,
habitation structures.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:50.892 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like Earth.

00:43:50.892 --> 00:43:52.808 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Well, it'll
be different from Earth,

00:43:52.808 --> 00:43:54.650 align:middle line:84%
but it will be like
Earth in the place

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:58.310 align:middle line:84%
that it will be
full of resources

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:03.840 align:middle line:84%
that we have created by
inventing the technology

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.900 align:middle line:90%
to bring them into being.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, there's been
talk that by going to Mars

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.160 align:middle line:84%
there's a problem
with radiation.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:17.460 align:middle line:84%
At a Ted convention, Jeffrey
Rusick presented that problem.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.030 align:middle line:10%
JEFFREY RUSICK: So, one of the
biggest problems we have is

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.910 align:middle line:10%
what's the effect on us
as we travel to deep space

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.040 align:middle line:10%
and how do we protect ourselves?

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:28.180 align:middle line:10%
So, I wanted to put this in.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:32.670 align:middle line:10%
When the Mars Science Laboratory
traveled to Mars last year

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:38.880 align:middle line:10%
and landed last year, the last
couple of bars on this chart

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.020 align:middle line:10%
are radiation dose, OK.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.480 align:middle line:10%
They measured radiation
dose on the way to Mars,

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.520 align:middle line:10%
and it took them
about six months.

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:48.985 align:middle line:10%
And then there's another,
the red bar on there

00:44:48.985 --> 00:44:50.990 align:middle line:10%
is the 500 days on Mars.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:55.100 align:middle line:10%
So, if you take the bars
that show if it takes you

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.780 align:middle line:10%
six months to get to Mars and
you spend 500 days on Mars

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:04.380 align:middle line:10%
and then you spend 180 more
days coming back, if you add up

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.680 align:middle line:10%
just those last two bars
in that curve there,

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.610 align:middle line:10%
you end up with a dose
that is deadly to you know,

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.360 align:middle line:10%
that's not healthy for humans.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.710 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't say deadly,
bad not good news.

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.710 align:middle line:10%
Because you can see
the comparisons here

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:23.960 align:middle line:10%
for the other things, so
the Space Station and things

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.780 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.630 align:middle line:10%
So, we need to
solve that problem.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:32.240 align:middle line:10%
We need to solve how
we protect ourselves

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.100 align:middle line:10%
if we're going to do
these missions to Mars

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.850 align:middle line:10%
and other places in deep space.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.675 align:middle line:10%
And we do not have the
answer for this yet.

00:45:38.675 --> 00:45:40.050 align:middle line:10%
This is one of
the things we just

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:41.420 align:middle line:10%
don't have the answer for yet.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that a real problem?

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: No.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.230 align:middle line:84%
This is just another
example of somebody

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:49.220 align:middle line:84%
saying you can't do your
program until you do my program.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.150 align:middle line:90%
The fact of the matter is this.

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:54.677 align:middle line:84%
And I have a doctorate
in nuclear engineering,

00:45:54.677 --> 00:45:56.135 align:middle line:84%
so I know a lot
about this subject.

00:45:56.135 --> 00:45:59.390 align:middle line:90%


00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:03.260 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the radiation
dose rate on the way to Mars

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.960 align:middle line:84%
is a factor of two
larger than what

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.240 align:middle line:90%
it is on the Space Station.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So, Peggy Whitson just spent
a year on the Space Station.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.082 align:middle line:84%
She got the same radiation
dose as she would have gotten--

00:46:15.082 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Going to Mars.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: --on a six
month voyage to Mars.

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:20.972 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there's
nothing wrong with her.

00:46:20.972 --> 00:46:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: There's
nothing wrong with her.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there's a number of
other astronauts and cosmonauts

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.890 align:middle line:84%
who've done multiple long
missions on the Space

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Station or the Soviet previous
Space Station, the Mir,

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:35.000 align:middle line:84%
in which they've gotten doses
fully comparable to what

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.380 align:middle line:84%
they would have gotten
going to Mars and back.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And we see no radiological
casualties among this group.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And now that's not
to say there isn't

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.790 align:middle line:90%
any increase in cancer risk.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:47.840 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.780 align:middle line:84%
The total cancer risk
you get by going to Mars

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and back would raise your
risk of dying of cancer,

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.830 align:middle line:84%
assuming there's no advance in
medical technique, by about 1%.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:00.080 align:middle line:90%
That is the average American.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 1%.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: That is, yes.

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:03.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're an average
American and you don't smoke,

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.960 align:middle line:84%
you've got a 20% chance
you're going to die of cancer.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.520 align:middle line:90%
This would make it 21.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're an average
American smoker, it's 40.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So, if in fact, we
sent a crew to Mars

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and we recruited
them from smokers

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and we sent them to Mars
without their tobacco,

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.010 align:middle line:84%
we would be reducing their
chance of getting cancer.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting stats.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yeah.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So, one reason to send people to
Mars would be for their health.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, the main health effect that
we've actually seen in space

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.760 align:middle line:84%
has not been from
radiation, it's

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.280 align:middle line:90%
been from zero gravity effects.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And NASA has studiously resisted
implementing the solution

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:42.020 align:middle line:84%
to zero gravity, which is
to rotate the spacecraft.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Because the NASA
space medicine program

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.180 align:middle line:84%
is controlled by zero gravity
health effects researchers.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So, these people are not
interested in protecting

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:50.720 align:middle line:90%
the health of astronauts.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.410 align:middle line:84%
They're interested in getting
research dollars to fill

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:55.910 align:middle line:90%
their own bowls of rice.

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:57.410 align:middle line:90%
This is absolute nonsense.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And these people
who say they want

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:04.490 align:middle line:84%
to put a space station in lunar
orbit, OK, and put astronauts

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:09.440 align:middle line:84%
in that so that they
can test the astronauts

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:12.650 align:middle line:90%
under larger radiation fields.

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:13.890 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is crazy.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:19.550 align:middle line:84%
This is like testing treatments
for wounds by taking soldiers

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and shooting them and then see
how well you can patch them up.

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.850 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So, once again,
astronauts need to be

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.200 align:middle line:90%
explorers not guinea pigs.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:35.030 align:middle line:84%
They're getting on the Space
Station comparable radiation

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:36.746 align:middle line:84%
doses as they would
get going to Mars

00:48:36.746 --> 00:48:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and back, except they're
not actually going to Mars

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:39.670 align:middle line:90%
and back.

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:42.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, imagine-- you know,
it's one thing to send out

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.900 align:middle line:84%
pilots in bombers
to do an air raid

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and have them risk
the enemy flak.

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:49.080 align:middle line:84%
It's another thing to have
them in training mission

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.080 align:middle line:84%
flying above your
own city and shooting

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:54.380 align:middle line:84%
at them with anti-aircraft
guns and take the same risk

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:57.320 align:middle line:84%
without actually
doing the mission.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.780 align:middle line:84%
One is ethical,
the other is not.

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could
convince people and entice

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:05.792 align:middle line:84%
them to do a Mars program,
how would you do it?

00:49:05.792 --> 00:49:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: I've been trying
to convince the government

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.960 align:middle line:84%
to do it by pointing out the
scientific gains, the gains

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.845 align:middle line:84%
to education by
challenging American youth,

00:49:13.845 --> 00:49:16.220 align:middle line:84%
learn your science, you could
be a pioneer of new worlds.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.100 align:middle line:84%
We'd get millions of young
scientists from that.

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And by what it means
in terms of America

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:25.610 align:middle line:84%
putting our stamp on the future
by having a major influence

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:28.550 align:middle line:84%
in establishing the first new
branch of human civilization.

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:31.691 align:middle line:84%
If I was to try to convince
private enterprise to do it,

00:49:31.691 --> 00:49:32.940 align:middle line:90%
I've been thinking about that.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I think what you'd have
to do is the following.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.248 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we'd have to
have the cost brought down

00:49:37.248 --> 00:49:39.290 align:middle line:84%
substantially by people
like Musk and Bezos,

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:41.300 align:middle line:84%
which they are in
the process of doing.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And when the costs are
brought down enough,

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:44.780 align:middle line:90%
go to Silicon Valley.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And I say listen guys,
this is what I want to do.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to establish an
inventors colony on Mars.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:51.950 align:middle line:90%
You guys invest.

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:56.210 align:middle line:84%
We will recruit 1,000 of the
most technically accomplished

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:59.090 align:middle line:84%
people who are totally committed
to the idea of expanding

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:00.980 align:middle line:90%
humanity to another world.

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:02.660 align:middle line:90%
And we will send them there.

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And on Mars, they'll have to
invent all kinds of things.

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:08.565 align:middle line:84%
They'll have to invent
super productive crops

00:50:08.565 --> 00:50:10.940 align:middle line:84%
because their agriculture will
be limited to greenhouses.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.316 align:middle line:84%
They'll invent
robotic technology

00:50:12.316 --> 00:50:14.356 align:middle line:84%
because there will be a
labor shortage and a need

00:50:14.356 --> 00:50:15.410 align:middle line:90%
for division of labor.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:17.360 align:middle line:84%
They'll invent
advanced 3-D printing.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.190 align:middle line:84%
They'll invent all
kinds of stuff.

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.980 align:middle line:90%
You'll get the patents.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.654 align:middle line:84%
OK, you know, in other words,
at the frontier where you have--

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They get the money.

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.528 align:middle line:84%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes, and
they'll get the money.

00:50:27.528 --> 00:50:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But the frontier is where
people are free to invent

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:31.340 align:middle line:90%
and forced to invent.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And we'll send the
best people to do it.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, the American
frontier, 19th century America

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.970 align:middle line:84%
was a massive engine for
technological progress.

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Yankee ingenuity, we
became famous for it, OK.

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we were freed of
all sorts of restrictions

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.580 align:middle line:84%
of the old world and we were
in a new and challenging

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.380 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.850 align:middle line:90%
We were forced to invent.

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:55.379 align:middle line:84%
Mars will be that
100 times over.

00:50:55.379 --> 00:50:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Robert, thanks
for being on the program.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: It's my pleasure.

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's exciting.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: OK.

00:50:59.090 --> 00:50:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's go.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Let's go on to Mars.

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you go?

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: In a heartbeat.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Would you come back?

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:10.510 align:middle line:10%
>>ZUBRIN: You know, the
Marquis de Lafayette

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:14.280 align:middle line:10%
came to help out in the
American Revolution.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.770 align:middle line:10%
And he did go back to France.

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:20.730 align:middle line:10%
But when he went back, he
brought back enough American

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:23.790 align:middle line:10%
soil to be buried in.

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And actually, he lived
a long time after that.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.860 align:middle line:84%
He was still alive
50 years later.

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.380 align:middle line:84%
If we were going
to Mars to stay,

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.630 align:middle line:84%
if we were going to Mars
to establish a colony,

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.100 align:middle line:90%
I would go to stay.

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But if we are going to Mars
as part of an expedition

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and we were coming back, I'd
bring back enough Martian soil

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.480 align:middle line:90%
to be buried in.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would?

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ZUBRIN: Yes.

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:44.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: All right.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:44.970 align:middle line:90%
How about that.

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Would you go to Mars?

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.240 align:middle line:90%
And would you stay?

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I would give
up all the wonderful things

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.920 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:54.295 align:middle line:90%
But it sure is intriguing.

00:51:54.295 --> 00:51:55.095 align:middle line:90%
I'm George Noory.

00:51:55.095 --> 00:51:57.440 align:middle line:84%
