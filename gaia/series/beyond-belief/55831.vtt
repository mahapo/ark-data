>>And I think many
people today don't

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:08.840 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:13.650 align:middle line:84%

really happened.

>>I felt like something
was watching me.

>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.255 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.280 align:middle line:10%
We've done so many incredible
interviews on "Beyond Belief,"

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:10%
but this one could scare you.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:90%
We're talking with Bill Bean.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:90%
He's a minister.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:90%
He's an exorcist.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:84%
They call him the
Spiritual Warrior.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:90%
And he's also a noted author.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Many things have happened
to Bill in this lifetime.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about that, and things

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:90%
that could affect you.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Bill, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BILL BEAN: Thank you so
much for having me, George.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.151 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor and a pleasure
to be here with you.

00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you sometimes
feel doing what you're doing,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
dabbling in what could be
the dark side, that they're

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:90%
out to get you?

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:10%
>>BEAN: Well, I wouldn't be here
if not for a calling by God.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:10%
As you know, I have
been an experiencer.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:10%
My family has been
destroyed by demonic forces,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.430 align:middle line:10%
and so it's been a full
circle type of thing for me.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was very much a
calling because I did not,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:84%
after being delivered
from this evil,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:84%
experiencing it for
so long, I didn't

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
want to get back into this
and get my hands dirty again,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
but God had a different
plan for my life.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:90%
And I resisted it for a while.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:84%
But George, there's nothing
else that I'd rather

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
be doing than to be reaching
out to help others out

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.675 align:middle line:84%
of this darkness and break
these chains and this bondage

00:01:45.675 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:90%
that people are in.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.217 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing
to be traveling

00:01:49.217 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:84%
around the country
helping people like this.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: This was your calling.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go back
and talk about episodes

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that occurred with
you, with your family.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.070 align:middle line:10%
>>BEAN: Well, as you know,
I've written three books.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:10%
The first one is
called "Dark Force."

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:10%
And in "Dark Force,"
I say that it all

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:10%
began in 1970 when
my family and I moved

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:10%
into a three bedroom
ranch style home located

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:10%
in Glen Burnie, Maryland.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:90%
It goes much further back.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I found out after
writing "Dark Force,"

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
a family member told me
that many, many years ago,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
a family member on my
mother's side of the family

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.077 align:middle line:84%
had actually opened a doorway to
conjure these demonic spirits.

00:02:27.077 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On purpose?

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
it originated from.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And I strongly believe
that that dark force led us

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:84%
to that house in Glen
Burnie, Maryland,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.074 align:middle line:84%
where evil was already
present and manifest,

00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it was so
severe for my family and I.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It greatly contributed to
the destruction of my family.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you first
went into the house,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:90%
did you feel that?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I was four years
old when we moved in.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:84%
We lived there
from 1970 to 1980.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.150 align:middle line:10%
And I can tell you
at the age of four,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:10%
I had this very uneasy feeling.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:10%
The house was semi-dilapidated.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.014 align:middle line:84%
I just had this-- it just had
this look and feel about it.

00:03:06.014 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Creepy.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Very
ominous, very creepy.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:90%
My dad was a master carpenter.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.695 align:middle line:84%
He saw this as a
restoration project,

00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
which he did quite
a bit of work to it.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Save some
money, sell it one day.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you, again, I
was four, my sister was 13.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
She said she felt the same way,
that something was just not

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.701 align:middle line:90%
right from the very beginning.

00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about some of
the evil things that happened

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:90%
in that house--

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.661 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yeah.

00:03:29.661 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: -that kept bombarding
you and your family.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well, my mom was the
first to have an experience.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And my parents were very, very
good people, William Senior

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.354 align:middle line:84%
and Patricia Bean,
very good people.

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They still with us?

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: They're not with us.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sorry to hear that.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Thank you.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And my dad being a
master carpenter,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.480 align:middle line:84%
my mom was a homemaker,
they believed in God,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't have any religious
upbringing or background.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.185 align:middle line:84%
We'd never attended
church as children.

00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:90%
We were never baptized.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
My mom, shortly after
moving into the house,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
it was while unpacking
boxes in the living room

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.470 align:middle line:90%
that she felt a presence.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
My dad had taken us-- I
have an older sister, Patty,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.380 align:middle line:84%
younger brother, Bobby, he had
taken us with him for the day

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to go to my grandparents' house
to allow my mother to unpack

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.704 align:middle line:84%
and organize in what they
thought would be peace.

00:04:16.704 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.995 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: It was during
the course of this

00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:90%
that she felt a presence.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.039 align:middle line:84%
She thought in her mind that
it was my dad sneaking back

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
into the house to
play a joke on her.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was that strong.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.218 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh, yeah.

00:04:26.218 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And she spun around
fully anticipating

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:90%
on startling him first.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And then to her shock,
nothing was there.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So she was unnerved by it,
taken aback, perplexed,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:90%
all these things.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.811 align:middle line:84%
Eventually able to recover and
go back to what she was doing.

00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't long after that,
that one of the bedroom doors

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.917 align:middle line:90%
slammed shut by itself.

00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
That was enough to
make her go outside

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:90%
and wait until we returned.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's where it began.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it escalated into
more feelings of presence,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:84%
noises, and then
gradually escalated

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:84%
into violent physical attacks on
us from these demonic entities.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: On all of you?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: My mother
and I particularly.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:90%
We suffered the brunt of it.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
My sister was the first to
have a physical encounter.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.300 align:middle line:90%
That took place in late 1970.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The house was
located at the bottom

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.710 align:middle line:90%
of a downhill cul-de-sac, OK.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
You walk in through
the front door,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:84%
the house was equally ominous
and foreboding on the inside.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:10%
Dark brown paneling
on the walls,

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:10%
almost black in the house.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:10%
Very, very dark in the house.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:10%
Very negative feel, heavy vibe.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.750 align:middle line:84%
You would make a right
down a long hallway,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and I shared a bedroom, first
on the right with my brother.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:84%
My parents' room was
the second on the right,

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.844 align:middle line:84%
and my sister's was the
last room across the hall.

00:05:41.844 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're spooking
me out already, Bill.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I got to
paint a picture.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.643 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:05:45.643 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: And my sister was in
her bed late one night asleep.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Something woke her
from her sleep.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.071 align:middle line:84%
She got startled,
she got frightened.

00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:84%
She knew something was there,
but she couldn't see anything.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She couldn't see
it, but she could feel it.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So she wanted to get up
and go and get my parents.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And as she was doing that,
something grabbed her leg.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.829 align:middle line:90%
So she let out a scream.

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Thank God she was able
to let out a scream.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
That alerted my
parents, woke them up.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
They ran into the room,
turned the light on.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was there.

>>NOORY: Nothing.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: However, there
were red marks on her leg

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.780 align:middle line:84%
where she said that
something had grabbed her.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.821 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like scratching?

00:06:20.821 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: It was
more like grabbing.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:84%
More like grab marks, so
you could see the red marks.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Almost like a bruise?

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh, yeah.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And my sister never again
felt comfortable in the house.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.200 align:middle line:84%
She wouldn't be there for
very much longer after that.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.825 align:middle line:84%
She ended up running away
in the middle of the night

00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:35.715 align:middle line:84%
and marrying a young
man in the neighborhood.

00:06:35.715 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This may have
forced her to do that.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And so she never again felt
comfortable in the house.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And once she was
out of there, it

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:50.060 align:middle line:84%
seemed like these forces-- the
MO of Satan and his demons,

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.316 align:middle line:90%
the MO is divide and conquer.

00:06:53.316 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It got rid of one.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Exactly.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's get the next one.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: So then the focus
seemed to go onto my dad.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a very
good man, George.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Very hardworking man.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.326 align:middle line:90%
A man's man.

00:07:04.326 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Hard as nails.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Tough guy.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.589 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No nonsense type guy.

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: No nonsense.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Was a contractor.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.135 align:middle line:90%
Worked very hard.

00:07:12.135 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Gone all the time.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.968 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh, yeah.

00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:90%
A good family man.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.424 align:middle line:84%
But I really believe
that he'd come

00:07:18.424 --> 00:07:19.590 align:middle line:90%
under this spiritual attack.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, he never shared
this with any of us.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.180 align:middle line:84%
But in later years,
he did share it

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:84%
with my mother's mother--
my beloved grandmother, Dora

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Harvey, he shared it with her,
that he was seeing apparitions

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and manifestations and
he was under some sort

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.204 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual attack
from the very beginning.

00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:84%
This was a man that
was so used to being

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:90%
in control of every situation.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.445 align:middle line:90%
He feared nothing or no one.

00:07:40.445 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: And I really think it
confounded his mind that this

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.764 align:middle line:84%
was something he
could not control,

00:07:46.764 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:84%
didn't know who to turn to,
didn't know where to go.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Because back then,
you couldn't just go--

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:90%
they didn't have these--

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They'd
think you're nuts.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.666 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Exactly.

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have these
paranormal groups

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And not having any type
of religious affiliation,

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.760 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't reach
out to any churches

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:84%
because, like you just said,
they'd think you were crazy.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe that this
contributed to his downfall.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
He began to drink
very, very heavily.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.320 align:middle line:84%
My parents were
social drinkers, but--

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you
see that spiral--

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh, yes.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.076 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: -as you grew older?

00:08:17.076 --> 00:08:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh, yes.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So he began to drink
very, very heavily, which

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
caused problems between
he and my mother.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.283 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:08:23.283 --> 00:08:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: And I'm sorry
to tell you that--

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tore up the family.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: -he began to
physically abuse her.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.626 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my.

00:08:28.626 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:90%
And he had never done?

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: No.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.437 align:middle line:84%
On a regular basis
between 1973 and 1975--

00:08:34.437 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you're witnessing
all this as a little boy.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Horrific.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:84%
And I have no
doubt, George, based

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:84%
on what I saw that these
demonic forces were present

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and they were able
to manipulate him

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
while under the
influence of alcohol.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And it really intensified
and fueled his rage

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:84%
towards my mother while being
in these drunken stupors.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And he would say he had no
recollections of anything.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Now again, I'm not excusing
my dad for the actions

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:84%
that he took; however,
the forces at work,

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and there truly were
demonic forces at work here,

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:84%
had a big hand in this
behavior and the steering

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:90%
of this behavior.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did he
ever come after you?

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Never once
came after me,

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:84%
but the focus seemed
to be on my mother.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And I guess because
they were at odds.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.955 align:middle line:84%
You know, he would stay
out all hours of the night

00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, my
mother's upset by this.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: So the focus
seemed to be on her,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.760 align:middle line:84%
but he did have
violent outbursts

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:90%
towards others at times.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's a shame
because I loved my dad.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:90%
He was a very, very good man.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I saw him as a heroic
type of individual.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So when this shift
began, it just literally

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:84%
tore me to pieces and
my perception of him.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry to say
that I carried a burning

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:84%
hatred towards him
for many, many years

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:84%
for these things that were
done and other things.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy to tell you that I was
able to eventually forgive him

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.402 align:middle line:84%
and it was before
his untimely death.

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:04.943 align:middle line:84%
You know, neither
of my parents lived

00:10:04.943 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:90%
to see the age of 50, George.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.304 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's very young.

00:10:07.304 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Extremely young.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh, yes.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, again,
I'm so thankful that I

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.755 align:middle line:84%
had that opportunity to forgive
him before he left this Earth.

00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Made you
feel better at least.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Much, much better.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When this
was going on, Bill,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.312 align:middle line:84%
did anybody physically
see anything?

00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Oh, yeah.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They did.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
The first to see a
manifestation I guess maybe

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:84%
would have been me at the age
of five years old in 1971.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much an experience
like my sister had.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm asleep in my
bed late at night.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, my brother and I shared
the bedroom first on the right

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.800 align:middle line:90%
down the hallway.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And his bed was
closest to the window,

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:84%
mine was closest to the
doorway, to the hallway.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Middle of the night, something
wakes me up from my sleep.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:90%
I can't see anything there.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can feel it.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: I feel it.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I feel the presence of
something, someone or something

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.710 align:middle line:90%
there, so I'm unnerved.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm scared.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:90%
I

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
don't see anything there, but
I know something is there.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm five years old.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:90%
So I go to get out of bed.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go in
and get my parents.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.396 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
remember all this, too.

00:11:12.396 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: I remember it vividly.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.540 align:middle line:84%
I could-- the trauma
level from this event

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.612 align:middle line:84%
is burned into my mind
and psyche forever.

00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's etched
there forever.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.135 align:middle line:84%
So I get out of bed, I'm going
to go in and get my parents,

00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and a tremendous force
grabbed me by my shoulders

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
and slammed me back
on the bed on my back.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
George, I've given over 1,000
interviews and I'm telling you,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
each and every time I describe
this it gives me chills

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.952 align:middle line:84%
because it was off the
charts for the trauma level.

00:11:40.952 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was going to die.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I thought my heart was going
to jump out of my body.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:45.997 align:middle line:90%
This event--

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just went
flying back into the bed.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.246 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: And then
I felt paralyzed.

00:11:49.246 --> 00:11:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I couldn't
move anything.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that seemed
to move or work were my eyes.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything else, I tried to
scream out for my parents

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:90%
and my mouth wouldn't even work.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was
holding you down.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.541 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely.

00:11:59.541 --> 00:12:00.830 align:middle line:90%
And I felt paralyzed.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I felt so helpless.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed like
it lasted for hours.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it only lasted
for several minutes,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of things
happened in that period

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:90%
of time, horrible things.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And it culminated with the
appearance of what I truly

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:84%
believe was a divine
manifestation.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
As all of these horrible
things were happening,

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful woman suddenly
appears at the foot of my bed.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.460 align:middle line:90%
She had like an--

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Angelic look?

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And had, I would say very
pale blue, if not white, type

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:90%
of shimmering gown.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
She we shimmering,
glowing, shimmering.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.232 align:middle line:84%
I felt so much love and
peace from this being

00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and all the horrible
things that were happening

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to me suddenly stopped
with the appearance.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe your
guardian angel?

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well, here's the
most incredible thing.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:84%
As this event
culminated, the lady

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
turned and floated up
through the ceiling.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:84%
The most incredible part of
this was this-- what I believe

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.030 align:middle line:84%
was a divine
manifestation, an angel

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:84%
if you will-- looked
exactly like my mother.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, she wasn't dead
at the time though, was she?

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: No.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
I got-- after this ended,
I was out of breath.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I was so traumatized,
I was sweating.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.834 align:middle line:90%
I ran in, woke my parents up.

00:13:24.834 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Of course, my dad, he
didn't want any of that.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.420 align:middle line:10%
But my mom, she went
back in with me.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Yeah, to comfort you.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:10%
>>BEAN: But I said to her, how
did you get in here so fast?

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:90%
That's what I said to her.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You thought it was her.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.041 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: And she said, what
are you talking about?

00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And so as the years progressed,
and those attacks happened

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
to me many, many times over
the years of living in there,

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and each and every time, George,
after the event would happen,

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.539 align:middle line:90%
I would feel like I had the flu.

00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:90%
I would have these high fevers.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: The body aches and
all this kind of stuff.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And then my mom began to
have these experiences.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.570 align:middle line:10%
And she was being attacked by
two entities in particular,

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:10%
and that very same woman,
who looked exactly like her,

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.302 align:middle line:10%
came to her rescue
on several occasions.

00:14:09.302 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And saved her.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Who in the family saw
something in a mirror?

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well, that photograph
was taken in 1975 in the house.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Now that's my mother
Patricia Bean on the phone.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see,
George, look how

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
dark that paneling
is on the wall.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So it was very little light
that came into that house.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:90%
So 1975, she's on the phone.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.470 align:middle line:84%
That is a large rectangular
mirror behind her.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.950 align:middle line:84%
There's an oval-shaped
mirror to her left.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, look at the
oval-shaped mirror

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:84%
that is reflecting in the
rectangular mirror and you

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:84%
see what appears to be a very
large alien-looking face.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
something in there.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.781 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely.

00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And If you look further,
George, to her right,

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.497 align:middle line:84%
you can see what appears to be
a little gray guy standing there

00:14:56.497 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the flash
of the camera coming off

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.132 align:middle line:90%
the top of its head.

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: And that is 1975.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:84%
All these events
are taking place,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.240 align:middle line:84%
all this chaos is taking
place in the house.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.995 align:middle line:84%
And my dad also left us around
this period of time in 1975.

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, he left?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did somebody
die in that house, Bill?

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.114 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: We were
told-- and again,

00:15:18.114 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
without really
knowing the answer,

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
my parents were
told that someone

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
had passed in that
back room where

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:90%
my sister-- where her room was.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.584 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
where it started.

00:15:27.584 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: And that room seemed to
be what I would call the portal

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:84%
or doorway, because that
room remained cold even

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:90%
on the warmest of summer days.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's also the room where
the door would open and slam

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:90%
for many repetitions at a time.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:90%
So something took place there.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just
that house, George.

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.470 align:middle line:84%
After my story came
out, and after I'd

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
written the book
and all that stuff,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
contacted by many people

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.009 align:middle line:84%
from the area telling me
about their experiences--

00:15:57.009 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The same thing--

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: -in the area.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: -was happening to them.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.059 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And I have since gone
back as a minister

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:84%
into the area to perform
spiritual warfare in some

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:90%
of those homes.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Were these homes built
on top of a grave or something?

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well, again, without
really knowing the answer,

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine did
some historical research.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:84%
According to his
research, there's

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:84%
a structure located two miles
south from that house called

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:90%
the Wishing Rock.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, behind the house is a
very large and deep ravine

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.270 align:middle line:90%
that kind of curved around.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And they said that this was
the land for Native Americans

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and they used to gather and
worship at this structure

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.141 align:middle line:90%
called the Wishing Rock.

00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:36.306 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's interesting.

00:16:36.306 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: And they said
that the Wishing Rock was

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.870 align:middle line:84%
some sort of gateway
or portal and it

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:90%
had these supernatural powers.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Now if there's anything
to this at all,

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:84%
then it is possible
that these entities

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:90%
came through that portal.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What an amazing story.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So your dad, while
this is going on

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and these demons, I'll call them
demons, are all over the place,

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
he just abruptly
leaves the family?

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well, again, it was part
of the downward spiral, George.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It's so sad and tragic because
my dad was such a good man

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:90%
and he was blessed with every--

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you saw this thing.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: He was blessed with
every physical attribute

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.020 align:middle line:84%
necessary to be highly
successful in life.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:90%
He should have flourished.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:84%
We should have flourished
with him as a family.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.831 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of course.

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: So when he began
this heavy drinking,

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:84%
it just started the
downward spiral.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.520 align:middle line:84%
His business began to fail
because he had just pretty

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:90%
much--

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.103 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was probably
unreliable at that point.

00:17:30.103 --> 00:17:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Had given up on everything.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And then not only with the
domestic abuse with my mom,

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:90%
he was having other issues.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Owed people money,
his employees,

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:90%
and things of that nature.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
It was horrible, the things
that were going wrong.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And I guess finally he
just-- one day he just left.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And he went,
relocated in Florida.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.565 align:middle line:84%
Went down there with his older
brother, my uncle Clifford,

00:17:57.565 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:90%
who is a very devout Christian.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.647 align:middle line:84%
And my dad had a battle
for the rest of his life.

00:18:02.647 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:84%
He went down there and
he would have periods

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:84%
to where he would do good and
stay away from the drinking,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and then he would
have periods where

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:90%
you would revert back to that.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you stay
in touch with him?

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well, I'm sorry
say, during that time period

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I very much hated my father
and I didn't want anything

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
to do with him;
however, a blessing

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
came in 1979 when my brother,
who unconditionally loved

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:84%
my dad, wanted to take
a trip to Florida.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:84%
I did not want to go,
but I ended up going.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how many years had
been since you had seen him?

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.077 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: It had been
probably four years.

00:18:34.077 --> 00:18:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.349 align:middle line:90%
Long time.

00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yeah.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I really still
didn't want to see him,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.460 align:middle line:84%
but I went with
my little brother.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Ended up being a
tremendous blessing.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reason the trip
ended up being a blessing

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.820 align:middle line:84%
is because my uncle Cliff had
a talk with me about faith.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And about if we had
faith, God would--

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.367 align:middle line:90%
we could connect with God.

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:90%
He would hear our prayers.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.784 align:middle line:90%
He would feel our faith.

00:18:56.784 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He's the one who got
you kind of straightened out

00:18:59.200 --> 00:18:59.960 align:middle line:90%
it sounds like.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: It was invaluable.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
That advice and that
conversation I had with him,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:84%
that was the beginning of the
planting of the seeds for where

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm at right now in being
a spiritual warrior.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It was the
epiphany in your life.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
George, I could not be here
now had I not been there.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So God does work
in mysterious ways,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and that teaching
was invaluable.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Little did I know
that on the very day

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I would come back
from that trip,

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I would engage in spiritual
warfare for the first time

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
against these entities
that had attacked us

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.429 align:middle line:84%
for so long, oppressed
us for so long.

00:19:33.429 --> 00:19:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll tell you,
George, it got unbearable.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
After my dad left, my mother
began having physical attacks

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:90%
from two entities in particular.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.294 align:middle line:84%
And my mother had cuts, bruises,
and scratches on her long

00:19:48.294 --> 00:19:49.210 align:middle line:90%
after my dad had left.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.381 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You probably
figured is dad back here?

00:19:51.381 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: It was horrific.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.338 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't-- it got to
the point to where she

00:19:54.338 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
couldn't sleep in
her bed anymore.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.300 align:middle line:84%
They were coming to her
bed, they were choking her.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.730 align:middle line:84%
They were hitting
her, scratching her,

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and one occasion,
she was being choked

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.850 align:middle line:84%
by this entity in black,
black hair, black beard,

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:90%
had a black suit on.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.680 align:middle line:84%
The eyes were even black,
and chalky white skin.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They wanted to
do something bad to her.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: No question about it.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So after the episode is over,
my mother is gasping for air,

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.862 align:middle line:90%
she gets out of bed.

00:20:22.862 --> 00:20:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Now she's got to go all
the way up the hallway.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.119 align:middle line:90%
She wants to get water.

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your dad
is gone by this time?

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Gone.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:90%
This is after my dad had left.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So she's gasping for
air, she wants water.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:84%
She goes into the
kitchen to get a glass.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So she opens the cabinet
door, and an unseen force,

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:84%
like a projectile,
shot a glass out that

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.450 align:middle line:84%
struck my mother above the
eye, split her eye wide open,

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:90%
knocked her unconscious.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
She had be taken
to the hospital.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:90%
She had to get stitches.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She could
have gone blind.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is the type of
attack that we were under.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And make no mistake,
when I say attack,

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean true, all out physical,
mental, and spiritual attack.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:84%
My family was
absolutely decimated

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.746 align:middle line:90%
by these demonic forces.

00:21:08.746 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is that
unusual, Bill, to have

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.580 align:middle line:90%
those attacks that violent?

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Highly unusual.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.732 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have
to say, since I've

00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
become a deliverance
minister, I've

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:90%
traveled all over this country.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.550 align:middle line:84%
God has worked through
me to help many people

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'm forever
grateful for that.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
I can honestly tell you, George,
that I have never encountered

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:84%
a case to the
severity of the case

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.010 align:middle line:90%
that my family and I endured.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thankful for
those people that I've--

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm amazed that you've
turned out the way you have.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: It's God.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Truly it is.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
This is God's
doing, because I've

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
been in many
life-threatening situations

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:84%
during the course
of my lifetime.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Yet, God made a way to
spare me each and every time

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.640 align:middle line:84%
for this very moment now
and for this very time frame

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:84%
that I'm in with God
working through me to help

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:90%
these people.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.028 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to, on
our next "Beyond Belief"

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
show, really get into
what you do for people

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:90%
and how you do this.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
When you were on with
me on the radio show,

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
we talked a little bit about
your father and a headless boy

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.225 align:middle line:90%
on a porch.

00:22:10.225 --> 00:22:11.225 align:middle line:90%
You remember that story?

00:22:11.225 --> 00:22:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yeah.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What was
that all about?

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.553 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: Well, that was
my uncle, Mike Zonek,

00:22:14.553 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and that photo was
taken in the '50s.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I never knew these
photos existed, George,

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:90%
until after my mother's death.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And we endured 10
years in that house.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.167 align:middle line:84%
We had a priest involved
for the last 16 months

00:22:28.167 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:90%
that we lived there.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after my mother--
two tragedies had occurred.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.750 align:middle line:84%
My beloved grandmother,
Dora Harvey,

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.850 align:middle line:84%
had passed from a sudden
series of heart attacks.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And two months and
two days later,

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
my beloved mother,
Patricia Bean,

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
had died from a cerebral
hemorrhage at the age of 44.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:84%
George, I'm telling you as
sure as I'm looking at you,

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt that
these demonic forces had

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
a hand in both of those
deaths because they

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:84%
were both under so much
stress and pressure.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I'm
telling you this

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
is because my mother had a
photo collection, which I never

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:90%
saw back then.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.010 align:middle line:84%
After she had passed, many
years after she had passed,

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:84%
my wife and I were
at my sister's house

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.917 align:middle line:90%
Christmas of 2005.

00:23:07.917 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
My sister said, would
you like to have

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:90%
some of mom's old family photos?

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:90%
And I said yes.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I started going
through the photographs

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:90%
and that was one of the photos.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And it is an amazing
photograph, to say the least.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Now on the surface,
one would think, OK,

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:90%
that's a double exposure.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:90%
What's the big deal?

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I want people to take a very
close look at that photograph

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:34.152 align:middle line:84%
because, first of all, you see
like this black blob shadow

00:23:34.152 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:90%
image beside him.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, what is that?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: I have no idea.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But secondly, you see two
children in front of him.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ghoulish.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.680 align:middle line:84%
The first one
doesn't have a head.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.062 align:middle line:84%
Now if you closer, look over
on that step right there.

00:23:48.062 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, something
happened at that house

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: No question about it.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I really think, without truly
knowing the answer, George,

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:84%
my best guesstimation
and my gut tells me

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that something horrific
happened in the entire area,

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.620 align:middle line:84%
whether Native American
land was disturbed

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.430 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it may be.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Because, again,
we have the factor

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
of all these other homes
that have had these problems.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Not to the severity that
my family and I did,

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.287 align:middle line:84%
but we do still
have it nonetheless.

00:24:18.287 --> 00:24:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: So, yeah.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Something did take place
there to really stir this up.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you couple
that with the conjuring

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:84%
by that family
member, and you had

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.574 align:middle line:90%
this incredible storm of evil.

00:24:31.574 --> 00:24:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And your dad died,
you said, at a young age, too.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.739 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: My dad was
shot to death in 1987--

00:24:35.739 --> 00:24:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: -at the age of 48.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was his
drinking because of that?

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Or was he robbed?

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Or what happened?

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Well, it had a factor.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It was a domestic
issue, so the drinking

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.340 align:middle line:84%
did play a role
in it, although he

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.704 align:middle line:84%
wasn't under the influence
of alcohol at the time.

00:24:50.704 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: At that time.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: He had actually--
the ironic thing

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.940 align:middle line:84%
is that he was going
through one of those periods

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:84%
to where he was straightening
his life up again,

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and he had stopped the
drinking for several weeks.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:90%
And, I feel worse for my--

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you thought he
was pulling himself together?

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.269 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Yes.

00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And I feel worse for
my brother than anybody

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.060 align:middle line:84%
because my brother is nearly
three years younger than I.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.234 align:middle line:84%
He was so young when my mother
passed, and many family members

00:25:16.234 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:90%
as well, George.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.191 align:middle line:90%
I have very little family left.

00:25:18.191 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
We've lost many family members
under bizarre circumstances.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We're your
family now, Bill.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.711 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely.

00:25:22.711 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:90%
And I praise God for you.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But my brother was
living with my father

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.537 align:middle line:90%
at the time in Florida.

00:25:29.537 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my God.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:32.328 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: So he's already
gone through this thing

00:25:32.328 --> 00:25:33.870 align:middle line:84%
with my mother,
and then my father

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:84%
leaves one Sunday morning,
says, I'll be right back.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:37.842 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to the store.

00:25:37.842 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:90%
And he never came back.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.258 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He gets
shot in the store?

00:25:40.258 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: No, he actually-- it
was a domestic-related matter

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:90%
so it wasn't far from the store.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But the next thing you know
there's a police officer coming

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:84%
to the door informing
my brother, who I think

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.320 align:middle line:90%
was 17 at the time, that--

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was shot to death.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.028 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: He was shot
to death, yeah.

00:25:54.028 --> 00:25:55.162 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you in shock?

00:25:55.162 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: I was in shock.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.536 align:middle line:84%
And I was living
here in Maryland,

00:25:57.536 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:84%
my brother was living
in Florida with him.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And I had come home
late one night,

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and I was living with my uncle
then, and he had a note for me

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:84%
on the table wake him up
no matter what time it was.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is like 3
o'clock in the morning,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.710 align:middle line:90%
so I knew it wasn't good.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.225 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: And I wake him up--

00:26:12.225 --> 00:26:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You hate
those kinds of moments.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: -and he
informed me of that.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And, very much like my mother
as well, I was in zombie state.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.290 align:middle line:90%
I just-- I couldn't process it.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It took several weeks
for it to sink in

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.280 align:middle line:84%
that it had really
occurred, you know.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.677 align:middle line:84%
And then I guess it
leaves such a void.

00:26:30.677 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And with my mother-- you know
my mother and grandmother,

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:84%
they were the two closest
people to me in my life

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:84%
so when they passed, I was
just dark and empty and bitter

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:90%
and in so much pain and turmoil.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Now outwardly, if you were
to talk to me back then,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I'd be cordial, but I kept
everybody at a distance

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:84%
because I was in so much
pain I couldn't allow anyone

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:90%
to get close to me.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:90%
I lived--

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't blame you.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: I lived that
way for so long, George,

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and then God began this
transformation in my life.

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:03.639 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Once this anger left in
you, did you see things change?

00:27:03.639 --> 00:27:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, I feel that
each and every one of us

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:84%
in the family were under demonic
oppression at various times.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think during
that time frame,

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I was very much under
demonic oppression

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.500 align:middle line:84%
because I can
recall days, George,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:84%
that I would just
get up in the morning

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and maybe use the bathroom
and come back and sit

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:30.649 align:middle line:84%
in a dark, silent room until
it was time to go to bed.

00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: In silence and darkness.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I did that so many times
because I was in so much pain,

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and I really felt that the
enemy had a grip on my life

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.130 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.599 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you petrified?

00:27:43.599 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: More like I was seeking
death, to be honest with you.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I was in so much pain, I
didn't want to live anymore.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.180 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't relate to anybody.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:90%
It affected my relationships.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't let anybody
get close to me.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So really I was, without
slitting my own wrist

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.430 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that, I
was seeking ways to die,

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and I was living very,
very recklessly in my life.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
I've been in many
life-threatening situations,

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:10.677 align:middle line:84%
but yet here I am today a
walking miracle from God.

00:28:10.677 --> 00:28:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:90%
No doubt.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAN: If God could
transform my life in the way

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
that he has and working through
me in the way that he does now,

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.040 align:middle line:84%
he can do that for anyone
who will call on him.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there's
a mission for you.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.054 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Absolutely, George.

00:28:22.054 --> 00:28:23.060 align:middle line:90%
It is my mission.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So again, I had to go
through those things

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.720 align:middle line:84%
and experience those things
to be where I'm at now.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to talk
on our next program

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.160 align:middle line:84%
about some of the things you
do with people to get them out

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
of that same rut that you were
in with those demonic forces,

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:90%
and they're out there.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:90%
But what do they want, Bill?

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:46.150 align:middle line:84%
What do these bad,
dark forces want?

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:46.947 align:middle line:90%
Our souls?

00:28:46.947 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:90%
What are they after?

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: They want everything.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.000 align:middle line:90%
God, Yahweh created us.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.040 align:middle line:90%
He loves us.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And when he created us, he
left a little piece of himself

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
inside of each and
every one of us.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:84%
The enemy knows this, so he
tries to keep us from God,

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and he confuses us and
he kind of muddies up

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.960 align:middle line:84%
the communication
between ourselves

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and God, Yahshua,
Jesus the Christ.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:84%
That name Yahshua
means Yahweh saves.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So God saves through
Yahshua, Jesus the Christ.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Again, the enemy knows this.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.440 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in
spiritual warfare, we

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:84%
see in the Bible Yahweh's
name was listed 6,823 times,

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and it was covered up
by the title of Lord.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:10%
So wherever you see Lord in
caps, it should say Yahweh.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.970 align:middle line:10%
So when I'm in battle,
I'll say, Yahweh

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.274 align:middle line:10%
rebuke thee in Jesus name.

00:29:35.274 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And it helps?

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.431 align:middle line:10%
>>BEAN: Oh, it-- they
instantly have to go.

00:29:38.431 --> 00:29:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Bill, if people
want more information on you,

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:90%
where do they go?

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.320 align:middle line:10%
>>BEAN: They can

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.422 align:middle line:10%
or www.billbeanministries.com.

00:29:48.422 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:10%
Whichever site you go to
is linked to the other.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, I answer
every single message.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:84%
George, I'm up till 4 or 5 AM
in the morning every morning

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
answering messages
from people in need.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And listening
to "Coast to Coast."

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAN: Of course.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:01.970 align:middle line:90%

Bill Bean about his role

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:10%
as a spiritual warrior.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:10%
What are the things that
he has to go through

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:10%
to fight these demonic spirits.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned on our
next "Beyond Belief."
