00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And I
think many people today don't

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle line:90%
know what to believe anymore.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.538 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.555 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.245 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:25.319 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:10%
We've got an exciting
program for you

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:10%
as we talk with a paranormal
researcher and author

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:10%
of the unexplained, Chad Lewis.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Chad, 18 books on the unusual,
the paranormal creatures?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.160 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing!

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHAD LEWIS: Anything
that's bizarre and unusual,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I've traveled the
world in search of it.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, these encounter
not only in your back yard,

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:90%
but around the world.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I
write about them is I

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:84%
want people not only
to read about them,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.066 align:middle line:84%
listen, watch them, but then
go explore for themselves.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.245 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did Chad Lewis
get interested in these things?

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I blame it on my
home state of Wisconsin.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:10%
We have three UFO capitals
of the world in my State,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:10%
and I grew up near one of them.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:10%
So when I was in high school
I went and interviewed

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:10%
people who were seeing UFOs.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:10%
And then I started studying
psychology at University

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.725 align:middle line:10%
of Wisconsin-Stout--

00:01:20.725 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Good school.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --and I started
presenting on human belief

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:90%
systems and human perception.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Why do some people believe
in the weird and unusual

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:90%
and others do not?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was really boring
statistical presentation.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.590 align:middle line:84%
You're glad you
weren't there, George.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
But people in the audience
would come up and say,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.770 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I think my home's haunted,
or I saw something

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:90%
in the woods I can't explain.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Could you help me investigate?

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And it continued through
my graduate studies

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of
spiralled from there.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.617 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now it's avocation
full-time, isn't it?

00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I travel the world in search of
anything out of the ordinary.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Monsters, crop circles, UFOs,
out of body experiences,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:90%
ghosts, abductions.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
If it's weird, the stranger
it is, the more likely

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.317 align:middle line:90%
you'll find me there.

00:02:06.317 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chad, what
does this tell you

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
about what's out there, when we
have so many different stories?

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Like you just mentioned, UFOs,
ghosts, strange creatures.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:84%
What the heck's
happening on this planet?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: There seems to
be so much more going on

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:84%
than we could ever
imagine-- as you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
said, that laundry
list of things

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.337 align:middle line:90%
that people are experiencing.

00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think people have
been experiencing it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning of time,
but as we progress now,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:84%
it's getting more and more
easier to come out with it.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:84%
That years ago nobody
wanted to report

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
a UFO because your neighbors
thought you were crazy.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But pilots
definitely didn't want to.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.445 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah,
they'd be grounded

00:02:45.445 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:84%
until they could undergo
a psychiatric evaluation.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But now, not only
are people more

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
willing to talk about
their experiences,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.844 align:middle line:84%
they're finding that others
have had similar things, too.

00:02:55.844 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What are
your favorite stories?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
What are your favorite
episodes of the paranormal?

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I like
monsters, of course.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Mysterious creatures.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Creatures that science says,
tell us shouldn't exist.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Skeptics say they can exist.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Yet every year,
thousands of people

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
are coming faced to--
well, not really faced

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:90%
with these monsters.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And I love stories with
unsuspecting witnesses.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Not people that are out there
looking for these things

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.645 align:middle line:90%
and then they find them.

00:03:23.645 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
You know the old
saying, when the weird

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:84%
comes looking for you when
you go looking for the weird.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But people that may
not even believe

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
in the strange and
unusual, but they've

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.679 align:middle line:84%
had an experience that
they just can't explain.

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Creatures.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's spend some time
talking about them.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
You've written a number
of books about them.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
What are we talking about
in terms of creatures?

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Loch Ness monster?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Bigfoot?

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.874 align:middle line:90%
What else is out there?

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Of course we have the
big ones, as you mentioned.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the whole host,
the variety of other creatures.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything from Central and
South American creatures

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:84%
of the Tata Duende,
El Chupacabra.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you have North
American creatures

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.207 align:middle line:90%
of the vampire stories.

00:04:05.207 --> 00:04:06.415 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: thunderbirds, right?

00:04:06.415 --> 00:04:07.331 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: thunderbirds.

00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans
believed in these giant birds

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
that would darken the
sky as they flew over.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And we think of these as old
Native American superstitions.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But it only happens
when people nowadays

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
have experiences
with them that we

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:84%
think maybe these stories
have progressed on.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But here in the
United States we have

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:90%
a plethora of these monsters.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Werewolves, phantom
animals, the Wendigo.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
All these legends that have
been here with the natives

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
or that have come
over with our--

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Mothman--

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: --ancestors.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --he's included too.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, These
giant bat-like creatures.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.931 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you've
looked at, investigated

00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
all these different
kinds of stories?

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, I think
in order to really

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
get deep into these
stories you have to go

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:90%
to where the stories occur.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:84%
That you have to go there
and interview witnesses

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and walk in the area
where they saw something.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think for me that's
the adventure of it.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:84%
That when somebody
tells you they've

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
seen a thunderbird
in the sky or that it

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:84%
tried to attack
somebody, you really

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.950 align:middle line:84%
get a feel of being
there on location

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that you can see what
they're dealing with.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And for me that's the most fun
is travelling to these places,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:84%
not only interviewing witnesses,
but collecting the folklore

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.900 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they willing to
tell you, Chad, what they've

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:90%
seen, what they've heard?

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Most people
are, especially people

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
that have had something
that has changed their life.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say
to me now, I don't

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:84%
believe in the
strange and unusual,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.615 align:middle line:90%
but this is what happened to me.

00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And a lot of
time they're very relieved

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:84%
to talk to somebody
who will believe them

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:84%
or that won't think
they're crazy,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
because I've had
people tell me stories

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
that they've kept to
themselves for 40 years in fear

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:90%
that nobody would believe them.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think for a lot
of people it's a relief

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:84%
to get this out
there, the experience

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:90%
that they can't explain.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.948 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody ever
broken down in front of you

00:05:57.948 --> 00:05:59.914 align:middle line:90%
and just started sobbing?

00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I've had
many people that

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:90%
have lost it in front of me.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it was an
emotional thing for them,

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
whether they were terrified
to death by the creature

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.640 align:middle line:90%
they were seeing.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the strange elements

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
to the monster sightings is
that most of the witnesses I've

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:84%
reported seem to have an
irrational fear when they're

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:90%
around these creatures.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
That they may be in the safety
of their vehicle or their home,

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:84%
but they feel as though if
they don't get out of the area

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be
harmed by these monsters.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes when they
do drive off in a hurry,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
they get home, they relax,
they feel a little foolish

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and embarrassed about
getting so frightened.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.589 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
about that moment--

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:39.755 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something in there.

00:06:39.755 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --where they feel that
their life may be in danger.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's talk about
some of these images

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:90%
that you brought to us, Chad.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, the
Van Meter visitor.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1903 a small
rural town in Iowa

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:84%
was terrorized for five nights
by this giant eight foot

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
bat-like creature,
that appeared,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:84%
that they thought was coming
from an old abandoned coal

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:90%
mine.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's what
we're looking at on the screen

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.067 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Based on witness
descriptions of that time,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
it was eight foot tall, it
had giant leather-like wings,

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
it had a horn protruding
from its head,

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and it was able to
shoot a light off.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
people first saw it.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was a
robber, an intruder,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
with a light dancing
over a building.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But as the days
went on in the week,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:84%
people got a
close-up view of it.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.930 align:middle line:90%
They even shot at it.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
They took deliberate
aim with buckshot

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:84%
in their shotguns,
their pistols.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Dozens of people shot at
it but it had no effect.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.102 align:middle line:84%
And this creature,
whatever it was,

00:07:34.102 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
was able to release an odor
that erased the memory of many

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.166 align:middle line:90%
of the witnesses.

00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:90%
So people always say that--

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How bizarre.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.424 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --this might
have been a hoax.

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it was a hoax
in 1903, whoever devised

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:84%
it was about 50 years
ahead of abduction research

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:90%
that we know of.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, the missing
time, the faulty memories,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:90%
the impervious to human weapons.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So this creature terrorized
the town for five nights.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.780 align:middle line:84%
They finally got
a posse together.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is rural
Iowa, 1,000 people,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.555 align:middle line:90%
most of them carrying weapons.

00:08:04.555 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's right.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.478 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: They went out to
the old abandoned coal mine

00:08:07.478 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and they watched this thing
just before daylight finally

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.279 align:middle line:84%
come back to its grounds,
its lair, if you will.

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They all witnessed it.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.153 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:08:15.153 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the fifth night

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
it had a smaller
version of itself,

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.274 align:middle line:90%
whether it was a female--

00:08:20.274 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A baby.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.481 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --the gender
of the species.

00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, an offspring.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And they said they shot
at it so many times it

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.480 align:middle line:84%
could have sunk the Spanish
fleet, but it had no affect.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
These creatures just simply
descended into the coal mine

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.502 align:middle line:90%
and disappeared.

00:08:34.502 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:90%
What happened to them--

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Unbelieveable.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: --we don't know.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we've never heard
about this creature since?

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.269 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: No.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And whether it went off to
become the Mothman of Point

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:90%
Pleasant, West Virginia.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.525 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe.

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Sounds similar.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: The Jersey Devil.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:84%
These things just seem
to appear for moments

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.284 align:middle line:90%
and then they're gone.

00:08:51.284 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
believe the story?

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: I do.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
When I first went there and I
dug up all the old newspaper

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:84%
articles, I thought it was
going to be a fun case,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
but very quick, it's
obviously a hoax.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I got there
I started seeing

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:84%
that it was much deeper than
I ever could have imagined.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
That most of the witnesses
were the most prominent men

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:90%
in the community.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why would they lie?

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.753 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:90%
They had the reputation.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Back then, nobody's
going to want

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:84%
to invest their money
with the town banker

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.482 align:middle line:84%
if he's seeing eight
foot bats in the sky.

00:09:20.482 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: So they put their
reputation on the line

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:90%
for these stories.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And they continued
through the years.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:90%
People did not know the story.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of hidden,
almost forgotten.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But people would still go out
to that abandoned coal mine.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
They thought it was haunted
because they would hear

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:90%
noises and see shadowy figures.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they didn't
know the visitor story,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:90%
so they thought it was ghosts.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
But now, as it turns
out, maybe they

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
were seeing these
creatures after all.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Indeed.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Next one I want
you to talk about

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.790 align:middle line:90%
is a creature called the duende.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.039 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Down in Central
and South America,

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:84%
the tata duende
comes in many forms.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But the most commonly
reported idea of it

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.637 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a diminutive
man-type creature.

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Funny head.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.510 align:middle line:90%
Funny head.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes will appear
with the sombrero.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big?

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.736 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Somewhere between three
and 1/2 and four feet tall.

00:10:12.736 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The man
or the sombrero?

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: The sombrero's very
big, the man's diminutive.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Some say its feet are
positioned backwards so

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:90%
you can't track it.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Others say it's
missing its thumb,

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
so when you go
looking for it, you

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:84%
have to tuck your thumbs
in case it sees you.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:90%
It will try to rip your thumb--

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really:

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: --completely off.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was approaching
it as mostly folklore,

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:84%
that these stories
have continued on.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a big jungle area--
what we would have a National

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Forest here in the US.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I was in the country
of Belize, and I

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:84%
went up to one of
the forestry workers

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and explained that I was looking
for stories of the duende.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:90%
I'd had sightings in that area.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
as though I was crazy.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:84%
He said, you shouldn't go
looking for the duende.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:90%
That is dangerous.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
was dead serious.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And then it turns out
just talking with him,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:84%
he had a story from
when he was a child

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:84%
playing in his back yard,
when all of a sudden

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:84%
he saw on the edge of the forest
the duende creature standing

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.009 align:middle line:84%
And he said it was singing
a lullaby or a song.

00:11:12.009 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It sounds
like a leprechaun.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, almost like
the gnomes, the fairy folk,

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:90%
the wee folk.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said he was
in a trance and he

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
started walking
toward this duende

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:84%
with this beautiful music,
when all of a sudden

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
his mother yelled for him
to come home for lunch.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said he snapped
out of it like that--

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And back he went.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.598 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --broke down
crying and ran back home.

00:11:30.598 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said he was
saved from the duende.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.485 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do these
duendes try to do to people?

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:36.151 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, most
people think they're

00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:90%
protectors of the jungle.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
That they're out there-- as
long as you're not harming

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:90%
the environment you're safe.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're OK, yeah.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: But others say it
will bring you back to its cave

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and you'll never
be seen from again.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.044 align:middle line:84%
And there are more sinister
aspects that it will take--

00:11:49.044 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they cannibals?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: --your life.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even consume you, take
your sight, your hearing.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.541 align:middle line:84%
Very similar to the fairy or
wee folk or goblins or gnomes.

00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are we still
getting, Chad, a lot

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.720 align:middle line:90%
of these reports of the duende?

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: When I was
in Central America,

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
rural areas, people

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:90%
still feared these creatures.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.522 align:middle line:84%
That they said, you better
be back before nightfall,

00:12:12.522 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
because if you're not
back to the village

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.311 align:middle line:84%
before the sun goes down, you
may encounter these creatures.

00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.893 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:12:18.893 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:90%
And they feared it.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:90%
They really did.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:84%
When you looked
into their eyes you

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:84%
can see that they not
only believed this,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.390 align:middle line:84%
but it was part of their
daily life to avoid it.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, beyond
just the artistic sketch,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:84%
do we have any real
photographs of these things?

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: We don't
have any photos.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And many of the witnesses
I've spoken with

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:84%
claim that when they
saw it, it didn't even

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:90%
occur to them to take a photo.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
They may have had a camera or
their cell phone with them,

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
but they were so terrified
that they were just

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
creature, making sure

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that it wasn't
coming toward them,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to
get out of the area.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Because many countries,
that's the view

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that you do not go
looking for these things.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
call out for them,

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.650 align:middle line:84%
because the mere
mention of their name

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:84%
will put you on
their radar and they

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.180 align:middle line:90%
can come searching for you.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hellhounds.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:84%
What kind of creatures
are we talking about here?

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:10%
>>LEWIS: Hellhounds, or
devil dogs as they're known,

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:17.087 align:middle line:10%
are giant black dogs often shown
with glowing red or green eyes.

00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: We've seen those.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LEWIS: Sometimes
they're transparent.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.049 align:middle line:10%
But they're very
big, heavily muscled.

00:13:22.049 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Sounds like a panther.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.150 align:middle line:90%
But even bigger.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And most people that see
them believe that they're

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:90%
doing the devil's bidding.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Most cultures believe that
they had supernatural powers.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with one guy who
saw it at a boat landing.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.049 align:middle line:84%
And he was a big
burly biker guy,

00:13:38.049 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
type of guy you wouldn't think
would get spooked by anything.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.214 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:13:41.214 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: He's the kind of
guy that scares people.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And he broke down
crying telling me

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:84%
that when he got to this boat
landing on his motorcycle,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
him and his buddy saw several
of these large black hellhounds.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And he said they were
nearly transparent,

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.190 align:middle line:90%
their eyes were glowing.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said they were
terrified and they took off.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And what frightened him the most
is that these creatures could

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.717 align:middle line:84%
keep up with them, no
matter how fast they

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:03.800 align:middle line:90%
went on their motorcycle--

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They came at him.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.855 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Came at him.

00:14:05.855 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until he
went to kick one of them

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and his big biker boot went
right through the creature

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
that the creature
finally disappeared.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:90%
And he said he kept driving.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:84%
They were so frightened they
kept driving for the next 40

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:90%
minutes to the nearest town.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So they're dimensional?

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.159 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, it seems
to be because they often

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
appear in areas that
you wouldn't think

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.170 align:middle line:84%
would have enough room
for them to inhabit.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.427 align:middle line:84%
That if they were there
physical, flesh and blood,

00:14:31.427 --> 00:14:32.760 align:middle line:90%
that it wouldn't be enough room.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:90%
You could see them.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But they often
appear in places that

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
have other paranormal
activity associated with it.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:84%
That it may be a haunted area or
a place that has a curse on it.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if they're
attracted to this area

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:84%
or they're part of
it, but they seem

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.810 align:middle line:90%
to come and go as they please.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has anybody
ever reported

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.460 align:middle line:84%
that they've been bitten
by one of these things

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
or that they witnessed
somebody being pulled away?

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Not
physically attacked.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.310 align:middle line:10%
More psychologically or
spiritually attacked.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.141 align:middle line:10%
Down in Central America
and South America

00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:07.765 align:middle line:10%
where there are more
stories of these--

00:15:07.765 --> 00:15:09.252 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: They've got a lot
of weird stories down there.

00:15:09.252 --> 00:15:09.835 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:15:09.835 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And the villagers said that if
you saw one of these hellhounds

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.720 align:middle line:84%
or devil dogs-- they call them
Cadejos, that if they saw you

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.430 align:middle line:84%
they could connect with
you and they would steal

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
your energy little by little,
and unless you could find

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.450 align:middle line:84%
a powerful shaman
or a bush doctor,

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.360 align:middle line:84%
you'd be dead within a
week of seeing these.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
harbingers, Chad,

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.309 align:middle line:84%
of something evil
about to occur?

00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, they seem to be
much like what you would think

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.070 align:middle line:84%
of the Irish banshee
or the Wendigo

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that these-- they appear
before something bad happens.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And many witnesses
that have seen

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.790 align:middle line:84%
them will tell me bad things
happened to them afterwards.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:84%
They're involved in
a minor car accident,

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
they broke up with
their significant other,

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:90%
fired from their employment.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Always mishaps, misfortune,
or even death that

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:84%
occurs after seeing
these creatures.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Lots of interest
in the creature we all

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:90%
know as Bigfoot or Sasquatch.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:84%
We get reports from
all over the country,

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:84%
from legitimate people
about these creatures.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:10.130 align:middle line:84%
What have your
investigations uncovered?

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: For Bigfoot, or the
Yowie, the Yeti, the Sasquatch,

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.190 align:middle line:84%
the abominable
snowman, these giant

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
bipeds walking upright on their
hind legs like you and I do.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Most people that see them are
split into a couple categories.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.830 align:middle line:84%
One is that they're a flesh and
blood undiscovered creature,

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.074 align:middle line:84%
like running into a grizzly
bear out in the woods.

00:16:29.074 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They're
very smelly, too.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yes they have
a distinct odor to them.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Many witnesses that's the
first thing they notice

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.059 align:middle line:84%
is that all of a sudden an
odor comes into the area.

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Permeates, yeah.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And then they see the creature.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
But even on the flip
side, I get witnesses

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:84%
who believe it's more of
a supernatural creature,

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's interdimension
or ultraterrestrial,

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:90%
that it's not flesh and blood.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.640 align:middle line:84%
That it moves at no speed
any known animal can.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to come in and out
of places at its will, which

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
may be one of the
reasons why we've never

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
found the carcass of
one of these creatures.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.849 align:middle line:84%
That these creatures
are said to exist,

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:10.232 align:middle line:90%
but maybe not on our dimension.

00:17:10.232 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How big are they?

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well,
most of the report

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:16.619 align:middle line:84%
seem to be somewhere between
six and nine, 10 feet tall.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:22.050 align:middle line:84%
350 to 500 pounds with this
thick dark matted-down fur.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.849 align:middle line:84%
Rarely have I received
reports of a smaller creature.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: People are
seeing something.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I don't
know what it is,

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:90%
but they're seeing something.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And of course,
I've had hunters

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.474 align:middle line:84%
that have told me while they're
out hunting in the North Woods,

00:17:33.474 --> 00:17:36.044 align:middle line:84%
they had these creatures
in their sight.

00:17:36.044 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And they were about
to pull the trigger,

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
but they thought to themselves,
what if it's a hoax?

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.490 align:middle line:90%
I could get in a lot of trouble.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.047 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Actually, you
won't get into trouble.

00:17:44.047 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Really?

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.073 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:17:45.073 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It has been determined that
if somebody is running around

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.650 align:middle line:84%
in a Bigfoot costume and
you take a shot at it,

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
you won't get
arrested or indicted

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.227 align:middle line:84%
for something like that
because you don't know.

00:17:57.227 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Sure.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You feared
for your life

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
with some idiot who is
dressing up like a Bigfoot.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.735 align:middle line:84%
There was one several months
ago who ran across the road

00:18:05.735 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and got hit by a
car and got killed.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And a
lot of these areas

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:84%
where the Bigfoot creatures are
seen, most people would say you

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
would never go dressed up
as a Bigfoot in this area.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.903 align:middle line:90%
This is hunting area.

00:18:16.903 --> 00:18:17.026 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No.

00:18:17.026 --> 00:18:17.500 align:middle line:90%
That's stupid.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:90%
People carry weapons.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:84%
They'll shoot you
without hesitating.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if there's
anyone ever been found

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:90%
to dehoax some of these cases.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.936 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On "Coast to Coast"
I interviewed a group of guys

00:18:28.936 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:90%
who are Bigfoot hunters.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:90%
They go out looking for Bigfoot.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'm opposed to that.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:84%
I think if we find
a creature like this

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:90%
we should try to preserve it.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe capture and study it
for science, but not kill it.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, and
maybe a limited

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.062 align:middle line:84%
or even the last of
its kind, that we

00:18:47.062 --> 00:18:49.270 align:middle line:84%
don't know how many of these
creatures are out there.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.896 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:18:49.896 --> 00:18:51.312 align:middle line:84%
I'm with you there,
George, that I

00:18:51.312 --> 00:18:53.600 align:middle line:84%
think it should be
trapped and studied,

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:84%
or some people say
leave it alone.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.310 align:middle line:84%
I've had many witnesses
who have encountered it

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and then they just
kind of walked away,

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't want to
get close or avoid it,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.355 align:middle line:84%
much like you might do
with an endangered species.

00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One of my favorite
creatures, sea creatures,

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:90%
sea serpents.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:90%
What have you uncovered there?

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.828 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: My favorite as well.

00:19:12.828 --> 00:19:13.389 align:middle line:90%
Sea serpent.

00:19:13.389 --> 00:19:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's it.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.763 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Around the
world, Loch Ness--

00:19:15.763 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I've been on two
expeditions to Loch Ness.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:10%
My home state of Wisconsin, back
in the late 1800s, early 1900s,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.110 align:middle line:10%
we had two dozen lakes,
rivers, and streams

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.772 align:middle line:10%
that claimed to be inhabited
by giant sea serpent monsters.

00:19:27.772 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's Champy
out there, right?

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, Lake
Champlain has Champ.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:84%
In Salt Lake City, Minnesota
on the Mississippi River

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:84%
they have the Lake
Peppin, and they

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:84%
have accounts from
Native Americans

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that first settled the
area, that they would only

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:84%
go into the lake with
their sturdiest canoes

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.160 align:middle line:84%
because they felt that
anytime someone drowned

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:84%
or went missing, it was blamed
on this creature called Pepie.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:84%
When the white
pioneers moved in,

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.630 align:middle line:84%
they started writing about it
in their newspaper accounts.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.604 align:middle line:84%
And now, the people of Minnesota
have offered a $50,000 reward--

00:20:00.604 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.124 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --for the
capture of Pepie.

00:20:03.124 --> 00:20:04.665 align:middle line:84%
But you can't hurt
it in the process.

00:20:04.665 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's go
look for Pepie, huh?

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.939 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: I've been on
several expeditions.

00:20:07.939 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
We had sonar, underwater
cameras, fishing equipment,

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
we even jumped in
using ourself as bait.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, or
maybe luckily for me,

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Pepie didn't attack me.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:22.226 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you were out at
the Loch, did you see anything?

00:20:22.226 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: When I was there-- I've
been on two expeditions there.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
My first expedition
it took a while

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
for the rolling waves or the
ducks that would come in.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
From a distance it would look
like something out of the norm.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But when you got
closer you could

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:84%
see that it was ducks
or a wake or a wave.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
The second time I
was there, I actually

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
had more UFO reports from
people than sea serpent reports.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And Loch Ness is
huge-- 22 miles long,

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:84%
couple miles wide, 700 feet
deep, and it's freezing cold.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm from the Midwest,
I'm used to cold rivers.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
But when I put my feet
in Loch Ness, it--

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's cold.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --was like
stabbing into them.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can't see very well, so
it's perfect area for something

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.557 align:middle line:90%
to hide undetected.

00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chad, let's
talk a little bit

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:84%
about the thunderbirds-- you
had mentioned them earlier.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.910 align:middle line:84%
There was an incredible
story out of Illinois

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:84%
where a thunderbird swooped
down and was picking up

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
a little boy, and the mother
came running out with a broom,

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
swatting at this
huge bird, and it

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
dropped the kid--
he wasn't too far

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.140 align:middle line:84%
off the ground at that
time-- and saved his life.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
One, what a frightening-- just
to see your little kid being

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.220 align:middle line:90%
flown away.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:90%
You know, oh, god.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And what was the bird
going to do with the kid?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Drop him down in his
huge nest and feed

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.052 align:middle line:90%
his little thunderbirds?

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Exactly.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I actually spoke
with the mother,

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and she told me that
when she was hitting it

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:84%
she grabbed onto the bird, or
grabbed onto her son's legs

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.726 align:middle line:84%
because it was being lifted
off the ground, the boy was.

00:21:55.726 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And she told me that
when she was hitting it,

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.200 align:middle line:84%
if she went to
grab the child, she

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:84%
thought it could have
easily just taken it away

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and she may never have
seen her child again.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:84%
But your question there
is very important.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.000 align:middle line:90%
What purpose?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Was it just looking for
food and it didn't differ

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.632 align:middle line:90%
from a fox versus a kid--

00:22:13.632 --> 00:22:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.839 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: --or was
it something else?

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because they picked
up little animals before too,

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.109 align:middle line:90%
haven't they?

00:22:19.109 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And they're flown up.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.470 align:middle line:84%
What kind of descriptions to
we get with the thunderbird?

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: thunderbird vary.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:84%
One is just what you would
think of a giant bird,

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.000 align:middle line:84%
but bigger than anything
we've ever seen.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cessna size.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:31.513 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:22:31.513 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:84%
They're talking small
planes of 30 foot wing span.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I found interesting
is that many stories

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.750 align:middle line:84%
that see these creatures
on the ground report

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes they won't
even flap their wings,

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.062 align:middle line:84%
that they can just extend
their wings and then fly off.

00:22:46.062 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And just glide away.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Very similar to Mothman
stories, that many people

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:84%
didn't see them flapping their
wings, but they could fly.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.262 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time
people see these

00:22:55.262 --> 00:22:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and they can't quite
believe what they're

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:84%
seeing because they know there
should be no bird that size,

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:84%
but yet it's right
there in front of them.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.727 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you getting
pterodactyl stories, too?

00:23:04.727 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Many people believe that
the Van Meter visitor

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:90%
may have been a pterodactyl.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:09.919 align:middle line:90%
And many people--

00:23:09.919 --> 00:23:12.543 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you know, it's a
good point, because the picture

00:23:12.543 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:84%
you showed us, it looks
like it could be one.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.574 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, and it had
all the trademarks of it.

00:23:16.574 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:84%
The wings, the leathery
skin, the claws.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But again, people say there
can't be dinosaurs still

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.259 align:middle line:90%
around here.

00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who knows?

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: I know.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's the fun
of it is seeing

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.120 align:middle line:84%
how not only these
stories originate,

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
but how they progress
over the years,

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes a folklore
may start off as one thing,

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.347 align:middle line:84%
but then blossom into
something completely different.

00:23:38.347 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
werewolves and vampires,

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:90%
do you investigate them?

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.083 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:42.083 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I spend time over in
Transylvania and Romania

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:90%
hunting--

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.555 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're everywhere.

00:23:45.555 --> 00:23:46.138 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:46.138 --> 00:23:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Hunting vampire lore.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And over there, I love the way
they viewed their vampires.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:84%
They didn't view them like we
do here in the United States

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.120 align:middle line:84%
or at least the mass media
of these supermodels that

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:90%
twitter and twinkle in the sky.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
They believe them
as hideous monsters,

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:84%
almost a combination
of what we consider

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.080 align:middle line:84%
a vampire, a zombie, and a
ghost all rolled into one.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
That these people come out
of the grave-- I say people--

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.170 align:middle line:84%
and they're still in their
burial clothing, ripped up,

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:17.660 align:middle line:84%
shredded, they're hideous
looking, they're foul smelling.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And they often
don't communicate.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:84%
They're just hellbent
on seeking revenge.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So many culture,
especially in Romania,

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that they would actually
stake-- modern times-- stake

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.890 align:middle line:84%
their loved ones into the
ground when they were dead,

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.950 align:middle line:84%
literally, so they
couldn't rise up.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in rural
areas of Transylvania, which

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:84%
is a big county
in Romania, people

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.210 align:middle line:84%
took it even to more extremes
that they would cut off

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.770 align:middle line:84%
the head of their loved
one, bury it separately

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:90%
from the body.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And before I went there I had
heard accounts of local areas

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that they would
create their dead,

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.680 align:middle line:84%
take those created
remains and grind them up

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:84%
into a fine powder, and
they would make a soup out

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.770 align:middle line:84%
of that powder, and the
entire community would consume

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:04.640 align:middle line:84%
the soup, thereby spreading
out the power of that person

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
so they couldn't come
back and terrorize you.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.654 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about voodoo.

00:25:08.654 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, voodoo.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:84%
When I was down in New
Orleans, of course,

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:90%
voodoo runs rampant down there.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And being with my
background in psychology,

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at how belief
systems, infer belief,

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
that if you believe
something's going to happen,

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:90%
is it more likely to happen?

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Believe or cursed, are we more
likely to have something bad

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:29.485 align:middle line:90%
happen?

00:25:29.485 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we
develop this ourselves.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:31.233 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:25:31.233 --> 00:25:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And either way it seems
to work, whether it's

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
something supernatural to it,
or if it's just us creating it,

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.100 align:middle line:90%
it seems to work.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with so many people
that would think nothing of it

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.680 align:middle line:84%
to go to a shaman or a bush
doctor, or a voodoo or hoodoo

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.646 align:middle line:84%
practitioner and look
for a love spell,

00:25:49.646 --> 00:25:51.270 align:middle line:84%
or that they believed
they were cursed,

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:84%
they needed somebody
as protection.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:90%
They needed something.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's a belief
that much of the world

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:84%
has that here in the US
we don't often believe

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:90%
in such percentages as they do.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of everything
you've investigated

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:84%
with creatures, what has
been the most fascinating one

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.160 align:middle line:90%
for you?

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: I like to werewolves.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.195 align:middle line:84%
A good friend and colleague
of mine, Linda Godfrey--

00:26:13.195 --> 00:26:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I know Linda well.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:14.903 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yeah.

00:26:14.903 --> 00:26:17.240 align:middle line:84%
She's been on your "Coast
to Coast" several times.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And Linda first started getting
reports of people in Wisconsin

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.660 align:middle line:84%
on a small rural stretch
of road that saw,

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better
term, a werewolf.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
They said it was
the size of a bear,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.780 align:middle line:84%
but shaped more like a
wolf with a long muzzle,

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and that dark fur, and
that it was a biped.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was often seen on the
side of the road late at night,

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.360 align:middle line:90%
but not always.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.790 align:middle line:84%
The good news for
me is that most

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.690 align:middle line:84%
of the reports I
get from witnesses

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
say that the creature didn't
charge them or attack them.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:84%
That it almost seemed
to be more comfortable

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.702 align:middle line:84%
hiding in the shadows to
get back and be unobserved.

00:26:52.702 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It didn't
want to take somebody.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:54.951 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:26:54.951 --> 00:26:57.890 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't looking for kill,
because many times people

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:84%
have seen it eating roadkill
or freshly killed prey.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And I love stories like
that, the werewolf,

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.630 align:middle line:90%
because they shouldn't be here.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:84%
By all accounts, we should not
be getting reports of a wolf,

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:90%
but yet we are.

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are they
part human, part wolf?

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Many people believe
they're shapeshifters,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that they can
transform themselves

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:84%
at will from a human or
another animal into a wolf.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Others believe there's some
sort of canine that just

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.560 align:middle line:90%
haven't been discovered yet.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:84%
That they maybe broke off
from traditional wolves

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:90%
in that they walk upright.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And they've been reported
all over the world,

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and now we're getting
more reports of werewolves

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.870 align:middle line:90%
than ever before.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you be
frightened if you saw a werewolf

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:38.569 align:middle line:90%
up front and personal?

00:27:38.569 --> 00:27:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LEWIS: Of course.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I always say when you
go to these places,

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.880 align:middle line:84%
if you're not getting scared,
you're not trying hard enough.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They walk on all
twos, too, don't they?

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: They're
upright, they're fast.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Many of these creatures seem
to exhibit supernatural powers,

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:84%
that they move at
speeds that are much

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:90%
greater than us humans can do.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'd freak out
looking at a wolf chasing you

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.180 align:middle line:90%
on two feet.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And there are legends
of how you can defend yourself

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.200 align:middle line:84%
against these creatures,
but for the most part,

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how to
kill them, especially

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.180 align:middle line:90%
if they're not flesh and blood.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because we don't all
have silver bullets either.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.958 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And most
of us don't carry

00:28:11.958 --> 00:28:15.450 align:middle line:84%
around silver bullets
or iron or hot tallow,

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.230 align:middle line:90%
as some kill the Wendigo with.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have these
weapons at your disposal.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So most people would
turn around and run.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So for me, even not even
seeing some of these creatures,

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:84%
just being in areas where
they've been sighted

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.860 align:middle line:84%
is enough to really make it
a creepy and unforgettable

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These myths of
these creatures, Chad,

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:84%
which go back way, way
back, were they stories

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.930 align:middle line:90%
or were they real?

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Well, that's
the great question.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Did people make these up and
then these creatures started

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.940 align:middle line:84%
to appear, or did
they appear and we

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.660 align:middle line:90%
started telling the stories?

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I think people have
always seen them.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.970 align:middle line:84%
When the people came to this
country from the old countries,

00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:84%
they brought all of
their legends with them.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.850 align:middle line:84%

the creatures with them, too--

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.774 align:middle line:84%

00:29:10.774 --> 00:29:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wherever they went.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Yeah, a

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.090 align:middle line:84%
That if you saw or
heard this banshee,

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:84%
the cry of the banshee, you or
someone within the community

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.180 align:middle line:90%
was going to die.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's like a cackle.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:20.691 align:middle line:10%
>>LEWIS: Yes.

00:29:20.691 --> 00:29:23.780 align:middle line:10%
And when the Irish people
came here and others,

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.300 align:middle line:10%
it was said the
banshees came with them.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So not only did
they bring legends,

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.980 align:middle line:84%
they may have brought
the creatures, too.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:84%

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: And that if
these creatures are here,

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.000 align:middle line:84%
they seem to be ahead
of us in technology,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.520 align:middle line:84%
so what they're capable
of doing, I don't know.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather stick to
the sea serpents.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't
deny it if someone

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.730 align:middle line:84%
said you want to see
a gray, if you will?

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: But it's probably
not high on my list.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.651 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Of every
creature we've just

00:30:14.651 --> 00:30:16.620 align:middle line:84%
talked about on this
program, which one do

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.480 align:middle line:90%
you think is the most possible?

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: For me,
it's sea serpents,

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.700 align:middle line:84%
that we have such
undiscovered area.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's no better place to
hide than water because we're

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.780 align:middle line:90%
not in it very much.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that there
could be these creatures that

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.000 align:middle line:84%
have continued on
that are not extinct,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.186 align:middle line:84%
or that have gone unidentified
over all the decades.

00:30:36.186 --> 00:30:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Chad, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LEWIS: Keep an
eye out, George.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:40.148 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Appreciate it.

00:30:40.148 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Creatures, they
could be everywhere.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.740 align:middle line:10%
Bigfoot, Sasquatch, the Duende,
the thunderbirds coming down

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.030 align:middle line:10%
to swoop down and pick you up.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:10%
If they do, run.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:55.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory, and this
has been "Beyond Belief."
