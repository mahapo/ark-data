>>GEORGE NOORY: Would
you be able to ascertain

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.790 align:middle line:84%
their personality,
their character

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.168 align:middle line:90%
from just reading a palm?

00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VERNON MAHABAL: Yes, you can.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Our activities determine
how the palm looks.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Lines-- lines can
change, and that

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:84%
means that we're either
doing our destiny

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:90%
or not doing our destiny.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.259 align:middle line:84%
Life doesn't come with
instructions, but it does.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.638 align:middle line:90%
It's on our hands.

00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:34.805 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:35.605 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:00:35.605 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It truly is.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome to this
edition of "Beyond Belief."

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:10%
Vernon Mahabal is
with us, a palmist

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:10%
and the founder and
director of the Palmistry

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:10%
Institute in California.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:84%
He has read literally
thousands of hands

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and given hundreds of
lectures on the ancient art

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:90%
of palmistry.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.302 align:middle line:84%
Vernon, welcome to
"Beyond Belief."

00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Thank you, George.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.768 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in reading palms?

00:01:02.768 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:84%
This isn't something
that somebody wakes up

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.232 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and
says, this is what

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do for a living.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:10%
>>MAHABAL: I was
always drawn to it.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Even when I was in high
school, I was reading hands.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.642 align:middle line:84%
I actually got a book on
palmistry in my school library.

00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I bet you were the
head of the party, weren't you?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.308 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Not at that point.

00:01:24.308 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:90%
My friends thought I was crazy.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.852 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I would
take people's--

00:01:28.852 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, what did
you see about the palms

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that you liked in
order to do it?

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:90%
What was your curiosity factor?

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.530 align:middle line:10%
>>MAHABAL: My curiosity
factor was that I just

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.090 align:middle line:10%
felt intuitively that there
was something about hands that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.160 align:middle line:10%
told about the human mechanism.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And even when I was a kid, when
I was, let's say, 10 or 11,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I would stare at my hands
and just ask myself,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:90%
what are all these lines?

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:84%
What are there are
these configurations?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:90%
What do they mean?

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So I was, I think, intuitively
drawn to it from, maybe,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:90%
a previous life or something.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is every
hand different?

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Every
palm is different.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Even your left--
even the left palm is

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:90%
different than the right palm.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about
identical twins?

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.668 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: They're identical
only in last names--

00:02:20.668 --> 00:02:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Facial
structures and stuff.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: --and
facial structure, yeah.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:84%
But astrologically, they're
as different as the leaves

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:90%
on a tree.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vernon, explained
to us what is palmistry.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Palmistry
is the ability

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
to look at our life purpose
through the anciency

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:90%
of our hands.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a GPS.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
The soul within the
heart sends its message

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
through the agency of the
hands, and that message

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.820 align:middle line:90%
is, what is our life purpose?

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:90%
What are we here to accomplish?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
What are our past
life challenges?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
What are we here to
accomplish that makes

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:90%
it different than other people?

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did it
take you a long time

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.782 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to read palms?

00:03:06.782 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: That's
a great question.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I studied it extensively,
read every book I could,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:84%
took every lecture I
could, met many palmist

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:90%
and studied their systems.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It did come a little
bit easier to me

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:90%
because I think I'm drawn to it.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I
did work hard to study it.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
But it is something that
I could easily inculcate.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When did you
decide to make it a career?

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: When nothing else
worked for me in my life.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Though, I would try this,
and I would try that.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I
always kept my door open

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:90%
to look at hands.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.655 align:middle line:84%
And when I kept my door
open to look at hands,

00:03:50.655 --> 00:03:51.780 align:middle line:90%
everybody would come to me.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I remember, one time, I was
traveling with a rock and roll

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:90%
band.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.557 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with these people,
and they would sometimes

00:03:58.557 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:84%
have me go on the road with
them and sell their t-shirts

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:90%
and be a roadie.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And at one of their
big Hollywood parties,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I was reading all these
rock stars' hands.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:90%
This was 1986.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing at a
7/11 one day, the next day,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
in the parking lot,
and some guy just

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:84%
drives up in a car
into the parking lot,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
gets out of the
car, slams the door,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and said, what are you hanging
out with these rock and roll

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:90%
people for?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:84%
You gave me a great
reading yesterday,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's what you should
be doing as a career.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:84%
He got back in the car, slammed
the door, and just drove away.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I
said-- that moment, I said,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
in LA and Sepulveda
Boulevard, Venice Boulevard,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:84%
I just said, this is
what I have to do.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm going back to--

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back to New
York and make it my career.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did we know
any of these rock stars

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.600 align:middle line:90%
if you mentioned who they were?

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, I've
read the hands of--

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
that was a tour with Motorhead
and the "Crone" mags.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I've read the hands of
so many rock and roll people--

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Gene Simmons.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Lemmy?

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.545 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You knew them all.

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I was lucky to be
able to be in New York and grow

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:90%
up with that whole--

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.167 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of the early
metal world, metal music.

00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Never did
Elvis' hands or anything?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: No,
unfortunately, not.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:84%
I wish-- I'd seen
him on the internet.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.453 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You might
have saved his life

00:05:31.453 --> 00:05:33.560 align:middle line:90%
if you have looked at it.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.840 align:middle line:84%
When you read
palms, can you tell

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:84%
if someone's going
to live a long life

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that?

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, you can.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
important to not

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:84%
tell a person's longevity
unless you can save them

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:90%
from some difficult calamity.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, if a person
is 30, or 40 or, even 50,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're going there may
be taking too many drugs

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
or doing bad
activities, then I'll

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
say, hey, get out of this so
that you can live a good life.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Get out
of it quickly, too.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But I don't ever like to plant
a number in somebody's mind

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:84%
because that may
actually happen.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vernon, on
the Gaia program,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:84%
"Open Minds," Ellen Goldberg
talks about the history

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:90%
of reading palms.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.688 align:middle line:84%
I want to get your
reaction to what she says.

00:06:24.688 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ELLEN GOLDBERG: I
think the roots go back

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:90%
to the dawn of time.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:10%
When we see the hands on
cave paintings, you know?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere from some of
them, from 25,000 years

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.800 align:middle line:84%
before the Christian
era, many from 8,000,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
9,000 years BCE, we
see that people knew

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:90%
that the hands were unique.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:90%
We did not have social media.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
There were no books,
but there were tribes.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:90%
There were stories.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And as people gathered
together, they

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
started to discuss things that
they saw both in the heavens

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:90%
and in the hands.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And so, these were some of the
earliest mystical sciences that

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:84%
were developed and really laid
the groundwork for so many

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:90%
other things that came later.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
When we look at, say,
palmistry as we know it,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
we know that the Chinese
used fingerprinting

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.592 align:middle line:84%
for identification 1,000 years
before we did in the West.

00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They used it
for diagnosis, certainly,

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:90%
way before that as well.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Do we really whether it
came its first roots were

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:90%
from India or from China?

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I, myself, can't make
a good call on that,

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:84%
but I know that we brought
back so much from the Persians.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They also had
exquisite astrology, right?

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
All of these great nations,
all of these great areas

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:09.940 align:middle line:84%
of the world had both astrology
and palmistry traditions

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.410 align:middle line:84%
reaching back
thousands of years.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I get a big kick out of

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:84%
is that, in the Vedas, these
ancient scriptures from India,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:84%
about 2000 BC, there is actually
an admonition to the monks,

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.210 align:middle line:84%
saying, you know,
it's really not

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:90%
right to read palms for money.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.869 align:middle line:90%
And so, therefore, we know--

00:08:32.869 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --it was already
a profession 2000 BC.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Yes.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You could do
it, but not for money--

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: For money.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: --for a monk.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vernon, how did
Ellen do explaining palmistry?

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I completely agree
with everything that she said.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the earliest known
book on palmistry in Sanskrit,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.225 align:middle line:84%
it's called the
"Hasta-samudrika-sastra."

00:08:55.225 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How old is that book?

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It was
written in 3102 BC

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.672 align:middle line:90%
by a person named Garga Acharya.

00:09:02.672 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: 5,000-year-old book.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: 5,000 year old.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.300 align:middle line:84%
It's as old as the
"Bhagavad Gita."

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the old--
that's when, let's say,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:84%
writing started in
that Vedic culture.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So in the Vedic
civilization, they

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
will say that
palmistry and astrology

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
have been around as long
as human beings have

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:90%
been on this planet.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And humans beings have
been on this planet,

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
according to the Vedic version,
for millions of years--

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:90%
millions of years.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And it is part of a spiritual
or religious tradition

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:84%
to read the hands and look
at the astrological chart

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:84%
It goes hand-in-hand with
understanding a person's life

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:90%
destiny and Dharma.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what's interesting,
in the Vedic view,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:84%
it was the astrologer
or the promised

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:06.220 align:middle line:84%
who gave the name to the
child, not the parents.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:90%
In ancient Vedic culture--

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The palm reader
gave the name of the child

00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:90%
to the parents.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, according to
what they saw astrologically.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You're going to
be William or whatever.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
According to what they
saw astrologically

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
in the hand or the chart,
they would give the child

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
a name based on the
vibrations of the planet

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.800 align:middle line:84%
so that they would be in harmony
with the planetary forces.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting what
she says about the idea

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
that people did not
do it as a profession.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
They did it as a profession,
but they didn't ask for money.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It was part of what we call
the Brahmanical culture.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And the Brahmins were either
doctors, or medicinalists,

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:90%
or they were astrologers.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And they would go to people's
houses and give readings.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, people would give
them donations, or alms,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:84%
or take care of them, give
them milk, give them food.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And they would go
to the next house.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't that something
that they charged.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:84%
They were considered an
integral part of the kingdom.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the family.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: And the family, yes.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as a child was born,
an astrologer or a palmist

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
was called to ascertain
the life destiny

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:84%
of the child and, of course,
how the parents can better

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:90%
raise that child.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:84%
They told the
parents, for instance,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:84%
what this person's
emotions are going

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:84%
to be like, what
the challenges are,

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.440 align:middle line:84%
what the good news is, what they
should be getting involved in,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:84%
what the relationship they
had in the previous life

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:90%
with that child.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So the palmist and
astrologer were a valued part

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient Vedic culture.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient Vedic culture
goes back millions of years,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.520 align:middle line:84%
according to a book called
"Srimad Bhagavad Gita."

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you imagine
the first palm reader ever,

00:11:55.730 --> 00:12:01.092 align:middle line:84%
looking at a hand, coming
up with all kinds of things?

00:12:01.092 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It's
absolutely amazing.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Vedas say that it
was demigods and goddesses who

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:84%
taught this astrological
science to mankind.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the book,
"Hasta-samudrika-sastra,"

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
hasta means hand, and samudrika
means the divine study of it,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:90%
and sastra means scripture.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:84%
So literally, this book
that was written by Garga

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:84%
means the divine
understanding of human destiny

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:90%
according to the stars.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you never met
somebody, Vernon, and you

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:84%
looked at their
palm, would you be

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:84%
able to ascertain their
personality, their character

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:90%
from just reading a palm?

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, you can, and
that's the beauty of astrology.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty of palmistry.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:58.620 align:middle line:84%
The hand is the visible
part of the brain.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:84%
It is that part of ourselves
that we cannot read,

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.870 align:middle line:84%
but it comes to us
through our hand.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it our personality?

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: It is
our personality.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:90%
It's our consciousness.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.800 align:middle line:84%
It's what we bring
from previous lives.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's the beauty
of reading for someone

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:90%
who's a young child.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And that just as we look at
a tree, we see an above--

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:84%
we see a tree may be so
many hundreds of feet,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
but on the ground, that tree may
be seven or eight times bigger.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's like the idea
of the previous lives.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So on your hands, we can see
a person's previous lives

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and then understand how they're
going to act in this life.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So that part, the idea of
a person's previous lives,

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:90%
we can't see that.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
The person doesn't
understand that.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But by our hands, we can see
what a person went through,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.727 align:middle line:84%
where they were, what they
did, what their challenges are.

00:14:01.727 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Their ups, their downs.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Their
ups and their downs.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:10.140 align:middle line:84%
People sometimes say, George,
that life doesn't come

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:90%
with instructions, but it does.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.523 align:middle line:90%
It's on our hands.

00:14:14.523 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's fascinating.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It truly is.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.520 align:middle line:90%
How does this tie into karma?

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: There's
three types of karma.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Karma simply means
action and reaction.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or what goes
around comes around.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: What goes
around comes around.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we
reap what we sow.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:35.775 align:middle line:90%
And it's very obvious.

00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree with that.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: We see that.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:90%
It's so obvious in palmistry.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.540 align:middle line:84%
For instance, people
ask me a lot--

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:90%
am I going to win the lottery?

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a common thing I hear at
a party or something like that.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, will you know
that through your palm reading?

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, you will.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, and
the interesting thing

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.490 align:middle line:84%
is that if a person wins
the lottery, it means,

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:84%
in a previous life, that
person was very pious,

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:90%
and they gave to the community.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.630 align:middle line:90%
They planted trees.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.690 align:middle line:84%
They opened up a hospital,
maybe they started an orphanage.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.150 align:middle line:84%
They were just very, very
giving and very generous.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, the next
life, the state

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.342 align:middle line:84%
gives it back to
them, so to speak.

00:15:14.342 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It comes back.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
if we do bad activities

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves or other
people, it comes back to us,

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and we have to taste the
results of those actions.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's called karma.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And karma is simply
for purification.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So a palmist or an astrologer,
especially a Vedically trained

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:40.080 align:middle line:84%
astrologer or palmist, will say
that suffering is actually not

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.645 align:middle line:84%
for a bad purpose, but it's
simply for our purification

00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:90%
to make us a better person.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.312 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: For our
incredible audience,

00:15:48.312 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:90%
would you read my palm?

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.415 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: I would love to.

00:15:50.415 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How do we start?

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Well, I'll
come sit next to you.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.630 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at George's hand,
we see that the palm is square.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is that unusual?

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: No.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:84%
We see that the palm
is square, and then we

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:84%
see the fingers a little
shorter than the palm.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So George has what we
call an earth hand.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:84%
There's four basic
shapes of hands.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:84%
One is earth, water,
fire, and air.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:90%
George has a perfect earth hand.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And what the earth
hand means is that he's

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.990 align:middle line:84%
able to take the ideas
that are within here

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.740 align:middle line:90%
and then make them tangible.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I can put our
ideas and make them work?

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Make them work.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.130 align:middle line:90%
You're a manifester.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, the earth hand
is about establishing

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:84%
security and stability on a
subconscious point of view.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And on a more conscious
point of view,

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.420 align:middle line:84%
the earth hand is about
being able to make your ideas

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:90%
tangible and practical.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And George, you have
a textbook earth hand.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Just like earth itself is very
grounded and very practical,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:90%
you are very practical.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.901 align:middle line:84%
Yet, your lines here show
that you're a visionary.

00:17:04.901 --> 00:17:06.359 align:middle line:84%
You're into the
metaphysical world.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I assume I was
born this way, right?

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:90%
I didn't change over time.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: No, the hand's
shape stays the same.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
The hand shape is actually
how you approach life.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:90%
It's like the car that we drive.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So the way you approach
life is in a very practical,

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle line:84%
down to Earth way, and
that's the earth hand.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And your thumb is
about 45 degrees angle.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the thumb
could be out here.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it could be
actually closer to the hand.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.210 align:middle line:84%
When the thumb is at a
45-degree angle like this,

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
it means that you have a very
strong sense of confidence

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.120 align:middle line:90%
and self-awareness.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, you can
yield to other people's needs

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:90%
or wants.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
When the thumb is
way out here, it

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:84%
shows a tremendous
amount of confidence,

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:84%
sometimes overactive
confidence, maybe even ego.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:84%
When it's here, it shows
insecurity and self-doubt.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:11.137 align:middle line:84%
When you see people who have a
lot of insecurity or self-doubt

00:18:11.137 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and lack of confidence, it
stays very close to the hand.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:90%
But yours is at a--

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:17.793 align:middle line:90%
yours is at the edge.

00:18:17.793 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, it's
naturally like that.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wonderful.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a textbook
example of someone

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:84%
who is very
confident, self-aware,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time,
very humble and giving

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to other people and being
able to yield when needed.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So if you didn't know
me, and you looked at my hand,

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.600 align:middle line:90%
you would say these same things?

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: I would, definitely.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know, when you're on
Coast to Coast, our radio show,

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:84%
you'll ask people to look
at their hands-- callers--

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and you'll talk about
the segments of a finger.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Why are they important?

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Oh, well,
these segments,

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:84%
we have 12 all together, and
they are what the astrologers

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:90%
call--

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:90%
well, we call them the signs.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So Aries, Taurus, Gemini,
Cancer, Leo, Virgo, like that.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:90%
So all the signs are here.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
The planets are here, and
the houses, the first house,

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
second house, third
house are here.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is your
astrological chart.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
In the same way that
an astrologer will

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:84%
look at a computer
and see the chart,

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
a palmist sees all the
planets, all the signs,

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:90%
all the houses in the palm.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is our
astrological chart.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not different from
an astrological chart.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.950 align:middle line:84%
We can see the same things
that an astrologer can.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So overall, what
would you say about me?

00:19:38.585 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: We're
talking about segment,

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
so this is your
strongest segment.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:84%
You see how it's
wider and thicker?

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:84%
If I was going to--
if this was a tree,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.160 align:middle line:84%
you see how this tree is
very, very strong, especially

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:90%
the base, much more than this.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So what this particular
segment shows

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:84%
is that you're able to give
people advice and counsel,

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.085 align:middle line:90%
and people see you as a coach.

00:20:03.085 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: This is the area of
being, let's say, a consultant,

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.560 align:middle line:90%
a coach, and someone who--

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
just like a football
coach or a baseball coach,

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:84%
they can give
advice and counsel.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
there's a warmth there.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:84%
So this shows a tremendous
amount of warmth to people.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, people see you

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
as their guide, their coach,
almost like their counselor.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is the strongest
segment on your palm.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is there
anything on my hand,

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:84%
my palm that would tell
you I'm a communicator?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.620 align:middle line:90%
You see how this pinky--

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.680 align:middle line:84%
the pinky is ruled by
the planet of Mercury,

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and Mercury is the planet of
communication and business.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, business
means communication.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So if someone has a pinky that
doesn't get past this line,

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.530 align:middle line:84%
it means they lack
communication skills,

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:84%
or they feel insecure
about communicating.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Your pinky is very long, so it
gives energy to communication.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You ever see
the movie "Babe"--

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: I did not.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: About the Babe Ruth?

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Pull my thumb.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.138 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm kidding.

00:21:12.138 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: You have
a very long pinky.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So the energies of the pinky--
and how do we know it's long?

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:25.530 align:middle line:90%
It moves past this segment here.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And your pinky is
especially long,

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
so it shows
communication skills.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Also, this particular line, this
shows communication ability.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it shows
exemplary communication

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:84%
abilities, the ability
to think of something

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and be able to communicate
it immediately.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So overall, what
would you say about me?

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: You're
doing the exact career

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.190 align:middle line:90%
that you're born to do.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:51.283 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's good.

00:21:51.283 --> 00:21:52.950 align:middle line:10%
>>MAHABAL: You're
doing the exact career

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:10%
that you're born to do.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:10%


00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.330 align:middle line:10%
There's a person in you
that is very practical, very

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:10%
grounded, likes--

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.495 align:middle line:10%
also, in your hand, it shows a
lot of order and organization.

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
You're very good at
planning and structuring.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So anything you
saw that you didn't like?

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: No.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, you're
being honest here, right?

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you tell
people bad news?

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: That's
what they pay me for.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:84%
People will say all the time,
George, don't sugarcoat it

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.640 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: That's what-- yeah.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.580 align:middle line:84%
People will say all
the time, don't give me

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.780 align:middle line:90%
a sanitized version.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:37.040 align:middle line:90%
I want the straight truth.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
I've noticed, George?

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.337 align:middle line:90%
It's not what you say to people.

00:22:41.337 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:90%
It's how you say it.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.500 align:middle line:84%
You can say anything
to someone if you do it

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:84%
with a sense of
empathy and love,

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and you really want
to help that person.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you see longevity
in a hand, their life,

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
how long they may live?

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes, you can.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And my job is to try to extend
that longevity if possible, you

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:90%
know?

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
But also, at the
same time, what I

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.330 align:middle line:84%
see as a palmist is
that we are eternal.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:13.003 align:middle line:84%
This body is just a
temporary vehicle.

00:23:13.003 --> 00:23:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a shell.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: It's a shell.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:84%
We get up in the morning,
put on a new shirt and pants,

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time, what I
see is that the soul is eternal.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
The soul is actually very
happy and, as they say,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
blissful, and the
soul is fully aware.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But while we're in this
material world, we forget this.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But it always gives me a lot
of hope and a lot of clarity

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:44.235 align:middle line:84%
to understand that this life
is a very-- it's spot life.

00:23:44.235 --> 00:23:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fascinating.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: And we're eternal.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:84%
We've never been born, and
we're never going to die.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Life is a continuum.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When two people
are getting together

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.110 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship, can you tell
by their two different palms

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:84%
if it's going to
work out or not?

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.900 align:middle line:84%
If two people are going to
be together for, let's say,

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:84%
a lifetime, you can
easily see that.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:84%
You can even look at
a kid, who's 6 or 7,

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and tell when they're
going to get married

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.760 align:middle line:84%
if that marriage is going to
be a significant relationship.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: I've
seen as many as--

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:84%
they say, is there such
a thing as a soulmate?

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I've seen as many I've seen as
many as seven lifetimes where

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
two people can become
to be together.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.610 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there is a
destiny in the idea

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:84%
of people marrying and being
together for many years.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have tragedies
on this planet, Vernon,

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:90%
and things happen.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:51.800 align:middle line:90%
We've had mass shootings.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:90%
We've had episodes like that.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:84%
If you were to look
at the shooter's palm,

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:84%
would you have been
able to have said,

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.160 align:middle line:90%
there's something wrong here?

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: You would be
able to see everything

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:08.030 align:middle line:90%
that also led up to that.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You would?

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.225 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:25:10.225 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who would you warn
on something like that?

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.475 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Obviously, their
parents, I would think.

00:25:14.475 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
would warn them, too.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But you would see the
psychological dysfunction

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even the--
you know what I see,

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
George, if I may be able to
pull up those palms of people

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:90%
who did nefarious stuff?

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, they've
taken drugs or not just--

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
it could even be
over-the-counter drugs or drugs

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:90%
that the society is prescribing.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.360 align:middle line:90%
That's what I see all the time.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do the palms
change physically?

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Lines
can change, and that

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:84%
means that we're either
doing our destiny

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:90%
or not doing our destiny.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.410 align:middle line:90%
We always have free will.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.270 align:middle line:90%
We have a destiny.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if a person
is destined, let's say,

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:90%
to be an architect.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were an architect,
or an interior designer,

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:84%
or a decorator in
a previous life.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In another life.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.763 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah,
they're going to want

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:06.450 align:middle line:90%
to continue that in this life.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.760 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, if
they are doing that,

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see their
lines become deeper, stronger,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.930 align:middle line:90%
richer.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Their hands are going
to become lively.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In my next
reincarnated life,

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:90%
what will my hands look like?

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:23.994 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: You'll--

00:26:23.994 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Will they change?

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: You'll probably go
into a more spiritual destiny.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
my next evolution?

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yes.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:90%
I think that you'll probably--

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm pretty
close there now.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: You'll probably
attain to some higher planet,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:84%
planet of the demigods or
goddesses, some other, what

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:52.630 align:middle line:84%
they call in Vedic astrology,
the places of the rishis,

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:57.120 align:middle line:84%
the demigods, the universal
management to what

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:90%
the Christians call the angels.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.215 align:middle line:84%
You'll probably ascend up to
the higher planetary regions.

00:27:02.215 --> 00:27:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:84%
You had mentioned soulmates,
Arielle Ford talks about them

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:90%
on Gaia's "Open Minds" as well.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:10%
>>ARIELLE FORD: I
really believe soulmates

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.890 align:middle line:10%
come in together with sacred
contracts to be together.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.290 align:middle line:10%
There's past life stuff,
and, there's karma.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's choices that
we make in between lives.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, yeah, let's be soulmates in
this next lifetime, and let's

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:84%
set up these synchronicities,
so we recognize each other.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.795 align:middle line:84%
And let's work out the fact
that in the three past lives,

00:27:28.795 --> 00:27:31.170 align:middle line:84%
you betrayed me, and we're
going to have betrayal issues.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
so many kids together.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.740 align:middle line:90%
But we forget all that.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:90%
We meet them.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.410 align:middle line:90%
We fall in love.

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:90%
We're in this euphoric state.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:84%
We're in what I call the
socially acceptable form

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:84%
of insanity because the
dopamine, and the adrenaline,

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and the oxytocin
is all kicking off.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's great
for 6 to 18 months

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.060 align:middle line:84%
until all the
chemistry goes away.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this
person with which

00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:00.720 align:middle line:84%
you had such frequency
and synchronicity with

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.250 align:middle line:90%
is just a real human being.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:03.667 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Yeah, see, I've

00:28:03.667 --> 00:28:06.280 align:middle line:84%
always viewed that as the
hook, as the soul's hook.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Yes.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MEREDITH: The means of
drawing people together

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.570 align:middle line:84%
for either something
very lovely, creative,

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and pleasurable or
for learning, which

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.050 align:middle line:90%
may feel the opposite of that.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Both are as equally as valuable.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But that chemical cascade,
I do believe as a projection

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.540 align:middle line:84%
from the soul to
say, don't go away.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.340 align:middle line:90%
Stay here.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a trick to keep
you together long enough

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to establish some other bond so
that you can dig down and start

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:90%
doing your thing together.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FORD: Exactly.

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: So it can be tricky.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.915 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
times, like when

00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:84%
you say the chemicals wear
off, it's, what was I thinking?

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, you weren't.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.590 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't your choice.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.007 align:middle line:84%
>>FORD: Right, it had nothing
to do with rational thought.

00:28:46.007 --> 00:28:48.360 align:middle line:90%
But it's an important piece.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Soulmates come together
to heal each other

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.700 align:middle line:90%
on the deepest level.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And as anybody interested
in personal growth knows,

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.570 align:middle line:90%
the healing part sucks.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't feel good.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not fun.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.580 align:middle line:90%
It's often painful.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Harville Hendrix,
who Oprah calls,

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.230 align:middle line:84%
the marriage whisper, he's one
of the world's leading marriage

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.030 align:middle line:90%
researchers.

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about this one day.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
Harville, how do if you're

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:90%
in the right relationship?

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.390 align:middle line:90%
And he started laughing.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And when he stopped
laughing, he said,

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.430 align:middle line:84%
you know you're in
the right relationship

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.900 align:middle line:84%
when it starts off as a dream
come true and eventually

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.450 align:middle line:84%
devolves into your
worst nightmare.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Vernon, have you read
a couple's palms together?

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Many times, and it's
called relationship counseling.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:84%
But yes, many couples have
come to me over the years.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
interesting things

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
is that what I see is that
in order for a relationship

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.080 align:middle line:84%
to become successful,
both people

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
have to understand the
other person's thinking.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I find
to be the difficulty.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.880 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we tend
to give in relationships

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.510 align:middle line:90%
what we ourselves want or need.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And what the hand
shows is that--

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and what I try to do
is explain to someone,

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is the way she is.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.540 align:middle line:90%
This is her wants.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.130 align:middle line:90%
This is her needs.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Think about her
needs, her wants,

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:23.690 align:middle line:84%
or his needs, and
not put your ideas

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:24.930 align:middle line:90%
of what you want in there.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.530 align:middle line:84%
In other words
relationship counseling

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:84%
is simply about letting
both parties understand

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.400 align:middle line:84%
how the other person thinks,
and then relationships

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.170 align:middle line:90%
go really smoothly.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.560 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing about what
your video was talking about--

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.310 align:middle line:90%
and I agree with them.

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen
people, for instance,

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.510 align:middle line:84%
two people will go dating
for about a month or two,

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and they'll lock
each other's horns

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.158 align:middle line:84%
and start fighting, and
then forget about it.

00:30:52.158 --> 00:30:53.450 align:middle line:90%
They're no longer relationship.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:54.658 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's over, all done.

00:30:54.658 --> 00:30:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: And other couples
will have a great time,

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.610 align:middle line:84%
will fight, will lock
horns, will argue,

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:90%
but they stay together.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And that means that those
people have known each other

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.320 align:middle line:84%
in a previous life,
and they're just

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:90%
reviving that relationship.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the same for,
let's say, children.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We can't give-- it's impossible
to give a child so much

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:24.240 align:middle line:84%
love unless we knew that child
before, or they knew us before.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So all the loving
relationships in this world,

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:84%
we've known them before, whether
they're a child, a parent,

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:90%
a relationship, even a dog.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:42.020 align:middle line:84%
In the same way
that this life is

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:84%
a continuum of the
previous relationship,

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:84%
loving relationships simply
continue into the next life.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, when they get through
difficult, they break apart.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.430 align:middle line:84%
The Vedic view, it gives
an example of, sometimes,

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:58.010 align:middle line:90%
we see an ocean.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And on that ocean
could be some straws,

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.520 align:middle line:90%
and they're very far apart.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Then, a wave brings
two straws together,

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and they stay together
for a long time.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And then another wave comes
and breaks them apart again,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and they never see each
other again for a long time

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.140 align:middle line:84%
until, let's say, they go to
the more spiritual planets.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:84%
But that's the way
relationships are.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:84%
We learn a lot about ourselves
through a relationship.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.930 align:middle line:84%
The person that
we're with learns

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:90%
about a lot about themselves.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we're done
with that, if you will,

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:32.330 align:middle line:84%
we go to the next relationship
and learn more, you see.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do we
determine the palm look,

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:39.710 align:middle line:84%
or does the palm
determine how we act?

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: George,
our activities

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.990 align:middle line:90%
determine how the palm looks.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of
both what we have deserve,

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.490 align:middle line:84%
what we deserve,
and what we desire.

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So the activities
of our previous life

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.370 align:middle line:90%
are our karma, so to speak.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So if we've done good
activities, we get rewarded.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.830 align:middle line:84%
If a person is very pious
in their previous life,

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.380 align:middle line:84%
they've done things for other
people, they've been generous,

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:84%
they've been a good person,
they've been of service,

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.110 align:middle line:84%
in their next life, they
will receive loving parents.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:13.430 align:middle line:84%
They'll receive
a nice atmosphere

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.910 align:middle line:84%
to live in, a nice
body, good schooling.

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:22.100 align:middle line:84%
If a person has done difficult
activities and put people

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.780 align:middle line:84%
into suffering,
then they're going

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.670 align:middle line:84%
to experience that
same suffering.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.470 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have
to taste that also.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So again, that's a
purification, too,

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.130 align:middle line:84%
which will make
them in are a better

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.470 align:middle line:90%
person in some next lives.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:36.620 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that
the palm reflects

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:84%
what we've done both good
and bad, if you will,

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.690 align:middle line:84%
in the previous
life, and we have

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:84%
no control over that
how the palm looks,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.700 align:middle line:84%
but we have control
over our activities.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to look
at the palm of Elon Musk,

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.980 align:middle line:84%
world's richest
person, Jeff Bezos,

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.670 align:middle line:84%
another multi-billionaire,
would you see similarities there

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:56.990 align:middle line:90%
between the two of them?

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: You'd
be able to see how

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:84%
that they're
successful in the world

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.280 align:middle line:84%
or they've got the
spotlight on them.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.700 align:middle line:84%
You'd be able to
see all the people

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.810 align:middle line:90%
that they have dealt with.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:12.300 align:middle line:84%
You'd be able to see that when
they were two years old, part

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.100 align:middle line:90%
of their destiny.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Can you predict the
future by looking at a palm?

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: Yes,
you absolutely can.

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.179 align:middle line:90%
You absolutely can.

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And even if, at the same
time, we have free will,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%
you can also look at
the nature of a person,

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.469 align:middle line:84%
their intelligence,
their psychology,

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
their emotional intelligence,
their maturity or lack

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.270 align:middle line:84%
of maturity, and
be able to predict

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.920 align:middle line:84%
what they're going to do or
not going to do over time.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.469 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When people come to
you for their palms to be read,

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:48.190 align:middle line:84%
do you sometimes try to
teach them how to read a palm

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:90%
themselves?

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:54.489 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: A lot of times,
people, after a reading,

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.830 align:middle line:84%
will start to look
at their own hands

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and maybe buy a book or two
on palmistry after that.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But usually, people
are not even so much

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:08.380 align:middle line:84%
aware of all the lines and
configurations on their hands

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.540 align:middle line:84%
until they get a
reading from a palmist.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And people, at the
end of a reading,

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.720 align:middle line:84%
will say, 90% of the time,
you got all that from my hand?

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.680 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know--

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know all
that was on my hand.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So they become fascinated with
the idea that, oh, my God,

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:90%
this is my life purpose.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So then, yes, they
start to buy books on it

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:90%
or go to palmistry lectures.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They obsessed with it.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.252 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah, exactly.

00:35:33.252 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, other
than when I started

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:84%
talking to you about
palms and stuff,

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how many
people are out there that are

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:90%
fascinated with this subject.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:84%
We've got a Gaia program
called "Initiation,"

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and Matias De Stefano
talks about hands.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:90%
He loves it.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.500 align:middle line:10%
>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: If we
go to the first humanity,

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.650 align:middle line:10%
when we were living
in caves, we knew

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:01.940 align:middle line:10%
that all the patterns that
we have in our existence

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:08.930 align:middle line:10%
were written in our hands, our
culture, our realities, our way

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:14.270 align:middle line:10%
of thinking, and the
main five structures

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:10%
of the sixth dimension.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:22.490 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron, the
octahedral cube, icosahedron,

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and dodecahedron are
printed in our five fingers.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's why to remember
the codes, what we used to do

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.990 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize
that our hands were

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:42.020 align:middle line:84%
the first structure, the first
book to tell all our stories,

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.380 align:middle line:90%
who we really are.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's why hands
were the first books

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:84%
to tell the stories
of our origins.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And from the caves,
we started to do

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.740 align:middle line:84%
the carvings, and the carvings
of the patterns of life.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Every pattern of life is not
only a circle from the sun,

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:05.370 align:middle line:84%
but also a spiral that
goes through time.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the second
more recognized patterns

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:84%
that we can see in all history
of humanity, in every culture,

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:17.570 align:middle line:84%
is circle within a
circle and a spiral.

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:84%
These symbols are all over
the world in every culture,

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and you can find
them everywhere.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And they all mean the
same, the cycle of life.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:31.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
Fibonacci spiral that

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.970 align:middle line:84%
helps us understand the
mathematics of the creation

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:38.450 align:middle line:84%
through the spirals,
through the torus.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When he
held up his hand,

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:84%
s you notice that long, long
deep line across his hand?

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.603 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Exactly.

00:37:45.603 --> 00:37:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MAHABAL: OK, so in most
people on the population,

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.100 align:middle line:90%
there's two prominent lines.

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:57.440 align:middle line:84%
One is called the heart line,
which is closest to the finger.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's a second line
called the headline, which

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.570 align:middle line:90%
is in the middle of the hand.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, what he has is that both
of these lines are one line.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Palmists sometimes call
that the simian line,

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and I don't like
that terminology.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:16.730 align:middle line:90%
I call it the union line.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:20.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the union of the
heart and the head.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So that means, whatever
a person thinks about,

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.340 align:middle line:84%
they put their
intelligence into.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Whatever a person feels,
whatever a person thinks,

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:90%
they put their heart into.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So he's
pretty spiritual?

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: Yeah.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So what that shows is that
when someone has a union line,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:84%
they must do something
that is a passion

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.590 align:middle line:90%
rather than just working a job.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:50.800 align:middle line:84%
They must do a career that they
feel a sense of intensity for.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And they become
intense because it's

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:84%
the merging of the
heart and the head.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.120 align:middle line:84%
So it means that whatever
a person thinks about,

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.100 align:middle line:84%
they become emotionally
involved in.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And whatever they feel, they put
all of their intelligence into.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And I like what he was saying
earlier about the book of life.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Our hands are the
book of our life.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.420 align:middle line:84%
When I'm looking at a hand,
I'm looking chapter by chapter

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.220 align:middle line:90%
by chapter.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You agree with that?

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MAHABAL: 100%.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing,
he's talking about the spiral.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And I like that
idea because this

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.690 align:middle line:84%
is what the new age, and
the mind, body, spirit world

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.640 align:middle line:90%
has talked a lot about.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.550 align:middle line:84%
The spiral has to do with
the oneness of things.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.120 align:middle line:90%
In other words, we're all one.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.820 align:middle line:90%
We're part and parcel of God.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:36.730 align:middle line:84%
In the Vedic view,
they call that Brahman.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Brahman simply means
the rays of God.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:43.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're
part and parcel of God.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Just like it said in
the "Bhagavad Gita"

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.660 align:middle line:84%
that all the drops
of water of an ocean

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.110 align:middle line:84%
contain everything
that the ocean has it's

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.880 align:middle line:90%
this that they're infinitesimal.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.070 align:middle line:90%
So in that way, we're one.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:01.370 align:middle line:84%
We're one with in
spiritual substance.

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But what an astrologer or
a palmist can talk about

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.520 align:middle line:84%
is that we're simultaneously
one and different.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.850 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that
we're individuals.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And the new age world and
the mind, body, spirit world

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.020 align:middle line:84%
have not come to
that conclusion yet.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
in the Vedic view,

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:22.940 align:middle line:84%
they call this in
Sanskrit, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a Sanskrit
verse which means

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:29.690 align:middle line:84%
well we are simultaneously one
with God, where we are one,

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:34.610 align:middle line:84%
but we're different in
individuality and destiny.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is the beauty of what
astrology and astrology can do.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're all one, then
it would be a boring world.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But if we have
individuality, like you're

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:84%
going to be the most famous
talk show host in the world,

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and somebody else is going
to be a great astrologer,

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and somebody else is
going to be an arborist,

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:90%
my job is to bring out--

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.300 align:middle line:90%
awaken the giant within.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to do.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's not that's
not an aspect of oneness.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.180 align:middle line:84%
That's an aspect
of individuality.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:13.760 align:middle line:10%
So I agree with the whole thing
about the idea of the cycles

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.590 align:middle line:10%
of life, the spiral.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:10%
And that has to do
with [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.960 align:middle line:84%
That has to do with,
yes, we're all one.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.560 align:middle line:84%
God created us as part and
parcels, but we're not God.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.330 align:middle line:84%
We're individual
sparks of that energy.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:32.150 align:middle line:84%
But what God did create for
us is our individuality.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And the most important thing
about individuality is that,

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:38.720 align:middle line:90%
with oneness, you cannot love.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.820 align:middle line:84%
With individuality, that's
where the devotion is.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:49.130 align:middle line:84%
When we show other people
our love and our devotion,

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:54.140 align:middle line:84%
that's the part of our
individuality that cannot be

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.248 align:middle line:90%
harnessed by the oneness.

00:41:55.248 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: How do people
