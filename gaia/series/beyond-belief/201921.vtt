>>GEORGE NOORY: Well,
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:10%
And we are going to
talk about your health.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:10%
That's because you
need to be healthy

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:10%
because we don't
want to lose you

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.960 align:middle line:10%
as a viewer on "Beyond Belief."

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Our special guest is
pharmacist Ben Fuchs

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.910 align:middle line:90%
from criticalhealthnews.com.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Ben has spent more than 35 years
as a registered pharmacist,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:84%
consulting nutritionist,
cosmetic chemist.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.697 align:middle line:90%
He's done it all.

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Ben, welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN FUCHS: Thank you.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here, George.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How are--
you look healthy.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.740 align:middle line:84%
You must be doing
something right.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: More time to work out.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm at home.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:90%
I've got more time to work out.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, good for you.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:90%
What's new?

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Ah.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.875 align:middle line:10%
What's new?

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:10%
There's all kinds of stuff new,
the whole dramatic stuff that's

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.540 align:middle line:10%
going on in our
culture and helping

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.798 align:middle line:10%
people deal with their immune
systems to help protect them.

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:10.090 align:middle line:10%
That's the best way, the way
I look at it, the best way

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.923 align:middle line:10%
to deal with all the
stuff that's going on--

00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:10%
strengthen your immune system.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All things considered,
if you have five people,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.455 align:middle line:84%
one's going to have a
great immune system.

00:01:19.455 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Another's going to
have an average one.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Another's going to have
a horrible immune system.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Why the difference between
the good one and the bad one?

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Great question.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, one
of the major factors

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
that's involved with how strong
we are via the immune system,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the immune
system, is our minds.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: How we see the world.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.388 align:middle line:90%
Do we see the world--

00:01:39.388 --> 00:01:40.930 align:middle line:84%
we see the world on
a spectrum, where

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:84%
on the left side of
the spectrum is fear.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
On the right side of
the spectrum is love.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.165 align:middle line:84%
And people are in different
parts of that spectrum.

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:90%
It's like a continuum.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.585 align:middle line:84%
The closer you are to
love, the more robust

00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
your immune system's
going to be.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:90%
The stronger it's going to be.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:84%
The more able it's
going to be to handle

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:84%
whatever vicissitudes,
ups and downs, attacks,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.732 align:middle line:90%
invaders that life brings on.

00:02:01.732 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And life is filled with
all that kind of stuff.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a jungle out there.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.222 align:middle line:84%
The more you're in fear, the
more your immune system's

00:02:07.222 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:90%
going to be suppressed.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And we all live our lives
somewhere in that continuum

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:90%
on some place.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, to me, that's the
most important aspect.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But then there are things like
food, the kind of nutrition

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:90%
you're taking, supplementation.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
You know I'm big
on supplementation.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.245 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Environment.

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: The environment,
the air you're breathing.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Wuhan, interestingly, is
one of most toxic and air--

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.530 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: They were having
riots last year about the air.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:90%
That's how bad.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:90%
The people were rioting.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
They were protesting about
how toxic the air was.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:90%
So in a way, surprise surprise.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.855 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Go figure.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: So yeah.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.415 align:middle line:84%
So the air you're breathing,
if you live in the mountains

00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
or you live in a
valley somewhere,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:84%
if you live in a house
that has mold in it,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.580 align:middle line:84%
if you're eating
processed food a lot,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.413 align:middle line:84%
there are all kinds of
factors are involved.

00:02:51.413 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:84%
But to me, that's
where leveling out

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
the playing field with
nutritional supplementation

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
You can allow your
body to handle

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.715 align:middle line:84%
a lot more stresses, via mental
stresses or physical stresses,

00:03:03.715 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:84%
if you're on a good
nutritional supplement program.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:10%
And that's really-- to
me, I focus on that a lot,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:10%
although I have
to say spiritual,

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.248 align:middle line:10%
mental, emotional,
physical in that level.

00:03:12.248 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
spiritually correct,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
you've got to be
mentally correct,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to be
emotionally correct.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Those are all factors.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But from a physical perspective,
exercise, respiration,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:84%
eating correctly, and get
on a nutritional supplement.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.263 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:03:23.263 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
My mother used to instill in
me as a young boy nutrition,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.897 align:middle line:90%
vitamins, supplements.

00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:30.313 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: She's
ahead of the curve.

00:03:30.313 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She would clip out
articles in the newspaper

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
that some doctor had written.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.408 align:middle line:84%
And she'd mail it to
me or send it to me.

00:03:37.408 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: So you were already
hip to this kind of stuff.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I was tuned into this.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
You can tell on our interviews
on "Coast to Coast"--

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yeah, you
know some stuff--

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And when we're there.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Your mother
was ahead of the curve

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.140 align:middle line:84%
because back then,
you were a health nut.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: They probably
thought she was a nut.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Some people, they probably
thought she was a nut.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And she's still
doing these things.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.817 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Good for her.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.075 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Georgie, you talked
to Ben Fuchs last night.

00:03:56.075 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Oh, is that right?

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.955 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell him to get me
this or that or stuff like that.

00:03:59.955 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: She's on a
supplement program?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's going
to be 91, and she's

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:90%
on a supplement program.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:90%
And she's going strong.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Is she exercising?

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She drives herself.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's excellent.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.697 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:04:09.697 --> 00:04:11.577 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: We are capable
of so much, George.

00:04:11.577 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:84%
There are people who are 95
years old who go up and down

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:90%
the Empire State Building.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Our bodies
are capable of so much

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:84%
if they're cared
for, if they're taken

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:84%
care of on all levels--
physical, mental, emotional--

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
spiritual, mental,
emotional, physical.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's like having a car.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
You can have a 1958
whatever, right?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
You could have a 1958 whatever
and have it running as perfect

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.292 align:middle line:90%
as a 2020 car.

00:04:37.292 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why does
it seem that when

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:90%
people retire, they fade fast?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because
giving and service

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and being engaged in the world
is a key part of being healthy.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.617 align:middle line:84%
Engagement-- we have created
a milieu or an environment

00:04:52.617 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
today where everyone's afraid
of each other, where we're

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:90%
disengaging from each other.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.208 align:middle line:84%
That's the exact
opposite of what you want

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:90%
to do for health and longevity.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.917 align:middle line:84%
And that's why,
like you say, when

00:05:01.917 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:84%
people disengage from the work
environment and stay home,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:90%
my mom doesn't want--

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:90%
she refuses to stop working.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.730 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to stop
working till the day I--

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:90%
I am not going to stop working.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were a
pharmacist for 35 years.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You gave it up.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Well, no, I'm still a--

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kind of.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I'm still a pharmacist.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you're
not at a drugstore--

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I couldn't do it--

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Making prescriptions.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: George,
I couldn't do it.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why?

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.472 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I couldn't
live with myself.

00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:90%
I was poisoning America.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.013 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I was the guy doing it.

00:05:32.013 --> 00:05:35.627 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk about drugs,
people think it's hyperbole.

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they think I'm
just one of those nuts,

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Boulder, Colorado crazy
people or something like that.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Strictly from a
scientific standpoint,

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:84%
one of the worst
things you can do

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:84%
to your body, strictly from
a scientific standpoint,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:90%
is take a drug.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not Pollyann-ish
enough to say

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:84%
you never want to take drugs
because there are times.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad they have antibiotics.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sometimes, they work.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Not very often.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Pain pill-- not very often.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Pain pills and
antibiotics, the drugs

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.980 align:middle line:84%
they give you for
chronic conditions,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
not only don't work for
that chronic condition.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But they put a
burden on the body

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that costs it nutrition
that doesn't show up

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:90%
on the side effect profile.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So you may take a drug and
say, what are the side effects?

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you might get drowsy.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.593 align:middle line:90%
You might get dizzy.

00:06:18.593 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
You might have
nausea and vomiting.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:84%
But they don't tell you
that it's costing you

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
B vitamins, vitamin
C, magnesium, copper,

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and a whole slew of other
nutrients to process that drug.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And the magnesium
deficiency that shows up--

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sucks it out
of you, doesn't it?

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: No, it causes--
your body uses magnesium

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:90%
to detoxify the drug.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:84%
See, to the body, when you
take vitamin C, the body's

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:90%
like, welcome home.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Hi.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You're
my friend, right?

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:84%
When it takes a drug, when
a drug enters the body,

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:90%
it goes, red alert.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Red alert.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Fight it.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.620 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Alarms.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.828 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's get rid of it.

00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And that costs magnesium and
B vitamins and essential fatty

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:90%
acids.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It depletes you.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It depletes
you to process it.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So now, you run a high
risk of a heart attack.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't show up as
the drugs you're taking.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
It shows up you just
had a heart attack.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So the connection between
diseases and side effects

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and drugs, the
drugs you're taking,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
is understated so dramatically
that when you understand

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:90%
the true impact, you are--

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:90%
I was completely horrified.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was the guy who
was dispensing the stuff.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did you ever
not dispense something

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.330 align:middle line:90%
because you didn't want to?

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I didn't because I
was working for drugstores.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:90%
And I just decided at the end--

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you didn't have
the right to do that, did you?

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I was
working for somebody.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:90%
I was working for a drugstore.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.240 align:middle line:90%
So I couldn't really do it.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So I developed an
expertise in skin.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
When I was in pharmacy school,
I worked for the Blistex

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:90%
corporation, actually.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
The guy who invented
Blistex was my professor.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is
for the face, right?

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: For your lips.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.935 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: So I studied lips.

00:07:46.935 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:90%
I studied skin.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I studied how you make
products, topical products,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that have therapeutic
and medicinal value.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So I know how to make
skincare products.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So I started a dermatological
pharmacy where all I did was

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
make skincare products
and-- check this out--

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:90%
use nutritional supplements.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to get your
views on investigative reporter

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Lynne McTaggart--

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:06.933 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes, I love her--

00:08:06.933 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Talking about how some
medications just don't work.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Let's talk a little bit

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:10%
about cures in general.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:10%
The British Medical Association
itself says that only about,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:10%
what, 12%--

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.727 align:middle line:10%
or is it the "British
Medical Journal"?

00:08:18.727 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:10%
>>LYNNE MCTAGGART: Mm-hmm.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Yeah--

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:10%
>>MCTAGGART: Yeah--

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: Says that about
12% of the various drugs

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:10%
and therapies actually work.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:10%
>>MCTAGGART: Yes, have
been proven to work.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.620 align:middle line:84%
They looked at all of
the major treatments.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.326 align:middle line:10%
And that includes not just
drugs, but other treatments.

00:08:37.326 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:84%
And they were really talking
about how much has actually

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:90%
been proven to be--

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and they studied all
of the literature

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.640 align:middle line:90%
around these studies.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, you're
talking about just 12%.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:10%
Now--

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:10%
>>MEREDITH: And
subjecting ourselves

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:10%
to these things with
these horrendous side

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.640 align:middle line:10%
effects for a 12% chance of
an actual cure or reversal

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:10%
of symptoms, anyway.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:10%
>>MCTAGGART: It's
really hard for us

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.790 align:middle line:10%
to accept this
because we really have

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:10%
built our lives around the
idea that medicine is a science

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.290 align:middle line:10%
and that we like to have
that kind of certainty.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:10%
And we believe
doctors are working

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:10%
with well-proven products.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:10%
And we have the FDA
and other organizations

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:10%
that really study the
stuff and make sure

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:10%
that these things are safe.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:10%
But the bottom line is this
is a highly, highly corrupt

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:35.130 align:middle line:10%
industry, with the vast majority
of its products have not--

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.510 align:middle line:10%
and the vast majority of the
treatments we take for granted

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.730 align:middle line:10%
have never been proven to work.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:10%
And I hate to say it,
but the vast majority

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle line:10%
are nothing more than
21st-century voodoo.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's Lynne McTaggart
talking to our Regina Meredith

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:90%
on "Healing Matrix."

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.197 align:middle line:84%
What do you think of
what she said, Ben?

00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:55.345 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: She's being kind.

00:09:55.345 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:90%
She's being generous.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.053 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, really?

00:09:57.053 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's worse.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:90%
It's worse.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How bad?

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because,
you see, we don't--

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.400 align:middle line:90%
it's paradigmatic.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not the specifics of our
techniques and our strategies.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:90%
It's the paradigm.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And the paradigm
is there's nothing

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.118 align:middle line:84%
we can do except take
care of your symptoms,

00:10:11.118 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
because there is nothing
they can do except

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.820 align:middle line:84%
take care of your symptoms,
because they're not addressing

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:90%
the causes.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:90%
And the causes are metabolic.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:84%
They're in the
chemistry, what we call

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.075 align:middle line:90%
in biochemistry the "pathways."

00:10:23.075 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
to understand how

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:84%
the body is moving and creating
things and doing its business

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:90%
and then backtrack.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:84%
It's called "troubleshooting"
in engineering.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't they
practice preventative medicine?

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.515 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's not
how they're wired.

00:10:36.515 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I think I talked about this
on your program before.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.243 align:middle line:90%
There's this great battle--

00:10:40.243 --> 00:10:41.410 align:middle line:90%
there was this great battle.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.493 align:middle line:90%
It turns out one side won.

00:10:42.493 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was the battle
between the prevention

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
or what we call the
"terrain," which

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
is the environment of
the body, and the germ.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.613 align:middle line:10%
And this was a battle that was
fought in the late 19th century

00:10:52.613 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:10%
between a guy named Pasteur
and a guy named Béchamp.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.135 align:middle line:90%
And Pasteur said, it's attack.

00:10:57.135 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Your body's being attacked.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.093 align:middle line:84%
All the bad things are
the result of attack.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And we need to come up with
ways of preventing the attack.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
That's called "germ
theory," by the way.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And Béchamp said, no,
it's not the attack.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
It's the environment that
the attack is coming into

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:84%
or the so-called
attack is coming into.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:90%
It's the environment.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that
we could use drugs for one

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:90%
and not drugs for the other.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:90%
So the one side won.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:84%
The germ theory-- the
so-called germ theory won.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Preventative medicine--

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And as rightfully so?

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: No, not rightfully so.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Absolutely to our great
detriment, because the terrain

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:90%
is about prevention.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
What you just said is
prevention means you

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:90%
take care of the environment.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.170 align:middle line:90%
You support--

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Fix the car
before it breaks down.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Rather
than take bubble gum

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.730 align:middle line:90%
and try to wire it together.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with the drug
model is it doesn't even use--

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:90%
this is so important.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't even use bubble gum.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:84%
It uses suppression of chemistry
to achieve its effects.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:90%
It suppresses your biochemistry.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Your body is a
finely tuned machine

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:84%
that our brain can't
even wrap itself

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:84%
around the complexity and the
intricate network nature of all

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.577 align:middle line:84%
the biochemical
systems and pathways

00:12:05.577 --> 00:12:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and all the things
that are happening.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:84%
You can't just suppress,
shut down, one side of it,

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:90%
just knock it out.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.945 align:middle line:84%
A beta blocker drug-- you've
heard of beta blocker drugs?

00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: They shut
your heart down.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
A calcium channel blocker
shuts your blood vessels

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.640 align:middle line:90%
in your heart down.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.573 align:middle line:84%
Immune suppressant drugs
shut down your immune system.

00:12:22.573 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Every drug you can
think of says--

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.062 align:middle line:84%
it's called an "anti"
or an "inhibitor."

00:12:26.062 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
work for anything?

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Symptoms.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But our symptoms are our
bodies' cry for help.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.448 align:middle line:84%
If your baby was
crying, would you

00:12:34.448 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
take scissors and cut his
tongue out and say, oh, well,

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.642 align:middle line:90%
it shut that baby up?

00:12:37.642 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:90%
That's how I shut my baby up.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Some sicko might.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: But they
take your gallbladder

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:84%
out when your
gallbladder cries to you.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: They take scissors, and
they cut your gallbladder out

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
because your gallbladder
is talking to you.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:46.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or your appendix.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Or your appendix
or something like that.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The model, the
paradigm-- so this

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.868 align:middle line:84%
is why we keep
talking about Lynne.

00:12:51.868 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:90%
I love Lynne, by the way.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
She's brilliant, and
her work has really

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:90%
been very influential for me.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It is.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.713 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:12:57.713 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: But it's
worse than that.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not 12%.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.740 align:middle line:84%
It's 12% if you allow
them to set the goal.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.020 align:middle line:84%
If the goal is to
quiet your heart down,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:84%
then maybe 12%,
maybe more than 12%.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But if the goal is to get you
healthier, which it should be,

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:84%
or the goal is to
increase your longevity

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.050 align:middle line:84%
or the goal is to increase
your quality of life,

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
your joie de vivre, zero, with
the exception of, as I say,

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:90%
antibiotics.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
But we pay the price in the
long run for antibiotics.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.082 align:middle line:84%
But for us, if you
have an infection,

00:13:25.082 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:90%
antibiotics are very helpful.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And pain pills-- and
I think pain pills,

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.110 align:middle line:90%
praise god for pain pills.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.525 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very important.

00:13:31.525 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you
can overdo that.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And I've known people--

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: If people
are in pain, they

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:90%
use them for psychological.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.327 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I know people who
have died from taking too many.

00:13:37.327 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: They use them for
suffering, not for pain.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference
between pain and suffering.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe
emotional suffering.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Existential,
absolutely.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:49.533 align:middle line:84%
But the fact-- if they're
used as analgesia, anesthesia,

00:13:49.533 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:84%
if you had surgery-- you know
how you used to have surgery

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.293 align:middle line:90%
100 years ago, 200 years ago?

00:13:53.293 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:84%
They give you a
bullet to bite on.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.335 align:middle line:84%
Or they give you a
little Jack Daniels.

00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:57.920 align:middle line:90%
They saw your leg off.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Or dental work--
can you imagine what

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:90%
it's like to have dental work?

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm glad we're
not living in that era.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.485 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:14:04.485 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
said earlier, I'm

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
not pollyannish about the
importance of medicine

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:90%
and creative medicine.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But to take an anti-diabetic
drug that will artificially

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:84%
suppress or manipulate
your sugar biochemistry

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
processing rather than not
eating a certain way is absurd.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And up until very
recently, the medical model

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.610 align:middle line:84%
said it had nothing to do
with what you were eating.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why don't you do both?

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Why take
something that your body

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:90%
has to process as a poison?

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- the
molecular structure

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.118 align:middle line:84%
of a drug has no
analog or is nothing

00:14:38.118 --> 00:14:39.410 align:middle line:90%
that the body has evolved with.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't recognize
these structures.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.340 align:middle line:84%
The body's evolved
with certain chemistry,

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry of apples,
the chemistry of pears,

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.870 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry of
vegetables, the chemistry--

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:52.730 align:middle line:84%
it didn't evolve with chemistry
of Lovastatin or the chemistry

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:84%
of Macrodantin or the
chemistry of these--

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Sildenafil-- and these
manipulated molecules.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:84%
So it sees these molecules, and
it freaks the heck out, George.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Why would you do
that to your body?

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It's disrespectful to the body.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.810 align:middle line:84%
The medical model
as we have it--

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:84%
the paradigm of
the medical model

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
is disrespectful
to God's handiwork.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:90%
It's disrespectful to the body.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:90%
It does not honor the body.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Everything I talk about on
your program and everything

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.347 align:middle line:84%
that you have when you
have alternative guests

00:15:21.347 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
on your program and
nutritional guests,

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:90%
we want to honor the body.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.987 align:middle line:84%
When you know about
the body-- and Lynne

00:15:27.987 --> 00:15:29.570 align:middle line:84%
said something very
interesting there.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:84%
She said doctors aren't
necessarily-- medicine

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:90%
isn't necessarily science.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's not.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Medicine is about diagnostics.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
This is why if I diagnose
something, I go to jail.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:90%
Medicine is about diagnosing.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.060 align:middle line:84%
It's about the right
to say, you have this.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:90%
I pronounce you diabetic.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you can take this.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And you can
take, and I am the remedy.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Medicine owns that.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, not even
the doctor owns it.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle line:84%
There's something called
"standards of care."

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard of
standards of care?

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right?

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:90%
They have to.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.908 align:middle line:84%
The model insists, makes them
prescribe a certain thing.

00:16:03.908 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you violate
standards of care,

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:84%
you could lose your
license or even worse.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just for
not prescribing.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Just for
not prescribing.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.605 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a chance to
talk with the late homeopathic

00:16:11.605 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
physician Dr. Robin Falkov about
the mainstream medical model.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.980 align:middle line:10%
What is going on on
this planet right

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:10%
now to try to control
the natural remedies that

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:10%
are out there, that
are available to us,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:10%
that are inexpensive?

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.360 align:middle line:10%
They want this because they
can't make any money on it,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:10%
can they?

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBIN FALKOV: No, you
really hit the point there

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.330 align:middle line:10%
with what's going on.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:10%
Homeopathy is cheap.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.770 align:middle line:10%
You don't have your
patients coming back

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:10%
to you when you
do a proper workup

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.060 align:middle line:10%
and you have identified what
their specific needs are

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:10%
to get to the root cause.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:10%
When you get to the root cause,
you're not treating symptoms.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:10%
You're treating the problem.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:10%
And that's how
you're able to heal.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:10%
That goes against the business
plan for Western medicine,

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:10%
because when you treat
symptoms, the medications

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.470 align:middle line:10%
have side effects.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.569 align:middle line:10%
And the side effects
bring the patients back

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:10%
for more medication.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:10%
And that creates
unknown entities.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:10%
It's a very, very
dangerous pattern

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.185 align:middle line:10%
that has become mainstream now.

00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
agree with Robin?

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Absolutely, 100%.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:19.990 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.125 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand that
we live in a corporatocracy.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Everything's a corporation.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Everything.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And a
corporation's dead.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:90%
A corporation is a zombie.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:90%
It's dead, but it's alive.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have a heart.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.938 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have a soul.

00:17:30.938 --> 00:17:31.960 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't bleed.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.170 align:middle line:90%
It bleeds green.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And so when it--

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's its god.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's its god.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if
a corporation has

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.220 align:middle line:84%
a fiduciary responsibility--
so if it can make money

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and screw you, it
has to do that.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Legally, it has to do that.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.723 align:middle line:84%
And that's OK--
well, it's never OK.

00:17:47.723 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's one thing
if it's your computer

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:90%
or your TV or your car.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But when it's your
body, that is unholy.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:90%
That is not fair.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:56.530 align:middle line:90%
That's not right.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:90%
But we-- I don't want to blame.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.560 align:middle line:90%
We live in a corporatocracy.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what we have.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.590 align:middle line:84%
We can take control
of our health.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we have to do.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some doctors, Ben,
if they prescribe medication,

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:84%
get ticked off when we question
why they prescribed it to us

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:90%
and what it's for?

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: What medical school
did you go to, Mr. Noory?

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.633 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Who's the doctor here?

00:18:18.633 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do
they get so upset?

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because
this is their turf.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are they offended?

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.062 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's their turf.

00:18:23.062 --> 00:18:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Who were you to--

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's my body.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Hello.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
a situation where

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
the operation was a success,
but we lost the patient.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.907 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And that's the
kind of model we have.

00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:38.665 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, who's
right, them or me?

00:18:38.665 --> 00:18:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's your
body, correct?

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: But you
see, George, this

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:90%
is endemic of a bigger problem.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.230 align:middle line:10%
We have abdicated
responsibility to authority.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:84%
We have somehow given up
our personal sovereignty

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to authority because we don't
think we're good enough.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't think
we're smart enough.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't think we're
capable enough.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.368 align:middle line:84%
And it's one thing
about your car.

00:18:58.368 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to fix my car.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing
about your computer.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
to fix my computer.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But what is more intimate
to us than our bodies?

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.327 align:middle line:84%
What should we know more
about than this thing,

00:19:09.327 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:90%
this head-to-toe thing, we have?

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I talk to a lot of
women, and women

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
have very interesting bodies
because their hormones

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:90%
fluctuate.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I am always amazed
how little women know

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.768 align:middle line:90%
about their hormonal cycles.

00:19:21.768 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
blame women, but that's

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
just an example of
how little we are--

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
how disassociated we are
from our biochemistry,

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.863 align:middle line:84%
from our metabolism, from our
physiology, from our anatomy.

00:19:32.863 --> 00:19:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
where their pancreas is

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.097 align:middle line:90%
or what their pancreas does.

00:19:36.097 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Or if you don't know what your
gallbladder does and the doctor

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:84%
says, oh, you don't need
that silly thing and it's

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:90%
causing a problem--

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's got stones.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.450 align:middle line:90%
We're going to take it out.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Exactly.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.003 align:middle line:84%
You're going to say,
all right, take it out.

00:19:46.003 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:10%
I don't know about it.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:10%
If you don't know how toxic
prescription drugs are

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:10%
and the doctor says,
you need to take this,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.972 align:middle line:10%
we have to give you this
drug, you're going to take it.

00:19:52.972 --> 00:19:54.030 align:middle line:90%
My mother had neuropathy.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:54.720 align:middle line:90%
You know neuropathy?

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: She had neuropathy.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Her toes--

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Was she a diabetic?

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Of course,
the tests say--

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:90%
you don't go by tests.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:84%
You go by symptoms,
if you're intelligent.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But the tests say no,
but she clearly is.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.680 align:middle line:90%
So she's got neuropathy.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:90%
So they gave her--

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
first, they gave
her a Gabapentin,

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
which is a drug that has
some slight pain relieving

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.090 align:middle line:90%
properties, but knocks you out.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.048 align:middle line:84%
She said she didn't want
that, so they gave her

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.030 align:middle line:90%
an antidepressant.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Antidepressant?

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: A horrible--
not even a--

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.945 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a benzo?

00:20:19.945 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: No, he gave
her Amitriptyline.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.210 align:middle line:90%
You ever hear of this one?

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:84%
This is an old-school
antidepressant,

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.820 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
this regard for the body

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that we as the owners
of the body have.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there are some
great doctors out there, Ben.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.465 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yeah, there
are great doctors.

00:20:34.465 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not the individuals.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:90%
It's the model.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:90%
It's the paradigm.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520 align:middle line:90%
There are great doctors.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:84%
There are great
doctors who research.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:90%
There are doctors who are smart.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
But the average doctor
is just like a worker.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:90%
He's a technician.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:90%
And his job is not to fix you.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:90%
It's to diagnose you.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is a mistake that we
make when we go to the doctor.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.960 align:middle line:84%
The doctor's role
is to diagnose you.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And then if there's something
they could do for it,

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:00.970 align:middle line:90%
they'll try.

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.137 align:middle line:90%
And they'll put it together.

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:90%
But they're trained to diagnose.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is disease,
according to you?

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Disease is out of ease.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:84%
The body has a certain
way of working.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And when it's
working, it's in ease.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Things are easy.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:90%
Chemistry's moving as it should.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.740 align:middle line:84%
When it short-circuits--
and basically,

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
what we talk about with
disease, from a biological

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:84%
or a bioelectrical
level, is short circuits.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is where vitamins and
essential nutrients come in.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Essential nutrients
facilitate the movement

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:90%
of electrical energy.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:90%
We're not chemistry, really.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.642 align:middle line:84%
We think we're
chemistry, and we have

00:21:34.642 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
a chemical model, a drug
model, a medical model

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:90%
that honors chemistry.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:90%
But we're really quantum.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.435 align:middle line:84%
We're really
electrons and protons.

00:21:41.435 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And the movement
of electrons and protons

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.890 align:middle line:84%
through the body is
what makes you healthy.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And nature has set
up a system where

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
there will be little breaks
in the flow of electrons

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.470 align:middle line:90%
and protons.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And a bridge will come to
fill those little breaks.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
You know what we
call those bridges?

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:84%
The essential nutrients, the
mighty 90 essential nutrients.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've
got to have that.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.215 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: They're the
bridge that allows

00:22:04.215 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:84%
electrons and protons to flow
through chemical reactions.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:84%
When we're diseased
or short circuits,

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:84%
the electrons and protons aren't
flowing as well as they should.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Even one supplement
could screw it up, right?

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Absolutely.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
All the supplements work
together as a team, a symphony.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:84%
In a symphony, if the violin
is missing or the oboe's

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.840 align:middle line:90%
out of tune.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You can tell.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:26.685 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It ain't
the same symphony.

00:22:26.685 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at Dr. Edward Group,

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.370 align:middle line:84%
who had an opportunity to talk
with Dr. Sue Morter on "Healing

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Matrix" about disease.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE MORTER: This message of
yours has been decades old now.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.860 align:middle line:10%
You're in this idea that
we need to get to the cause

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:10%
and not treat the symptom
and not load the body up

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:10%
with a bunch of
pharmaceuticals in order

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.418 align:middle line:10%
to have some healing happen.

00:22:47.418 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:10%
So can you just say
a little bit more

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:10%
about what this idea
of the root cause is,

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:10%
for our viewers that might not
be as acclimated to this idea

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:10%
as you and I are in this moment?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARD GROUP: Yes, absolutely.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:10%
So the first thing
we wanted to do

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:10%
was to look at why
people were sick.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:10%
And talking to
doctors, we evaluated

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.670 align:middle line:10%
what they were finding
on blood work, what

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:10%
they were finding
by just talking

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.460 align:middle line:10%
to the individual patient.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times, you can just
get so much information just

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.840 align:middle line:10%
by speaking to the individual.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:10%
But what we found was
all disease or the root

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.970 align:middle line:10%
cause of all disease was
a combination of toxins.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:10%
We looked at-- we broke
it down into categories.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:10%
We found that there's a certain
level of toxins in the air

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:10%
that we breathe
because we're taking

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.060 align:middle line:10%
thousands of breaths, 30,000
breaths every single day.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:10%
Most people live
in an environment

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:10%
where they're breathing
toxic indoor air.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:10%
They're breathing
toxic outdoor air.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:10%
And air can contain many, many
different forms of toxins.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:10%
What we were looking
at was how are

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:59.160 align:middle line:10%
people being exposed to any
type of disease causing agent.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:10%
So we looked at the air first.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.940 align:middle line:10%
And we found that
most people that

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:10%
had any type of
disease or condition

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:10%
were exposed to some form
of chemicals in the air.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.680 align:middle line:10%
Then we looked at the food
that they were eating.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:10%
So we broke it down into
two categories, basically,

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:10%
the internal environment
and the external environment

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:10%
that people were exposed to.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.380 align:middle line:10%
Air would be external.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:10%
Food would be internal.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:10%
And then we looked at the
genetically modified foods,

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:10%
the processed foods,
the microwaved foods,

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:10%
all of the
preservatives in foods.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:32.640 align:middle line:10%
And we found that most of
the foods were contaminated.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:10%
Then we looked at water,
which is the number one

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:10%
substance that we have.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.533 align:middle line:10%
All living things are composed
of at least 80% water,

00:24:40.533 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:10%
including the Earth and
plants and everything.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:10%
So water was a big
component that we looked at.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.900 align:middle line:10%
And we found that the
toxins in the water

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:10%
supplies, whether it's fluoride,
bromine, chlorine, prescription

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.580 align:middle line:10%
drug residue, endocrine
disrupting chemicals, all

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:10%
of these things-- heavy
metals in the water supply,

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:10%
the fracking, which was
even creating natural gases

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.120 align:middle line:10%
in the water supply.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.830 align:middle line:10%
So these were contributing
to the toxic load in people.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:10%
And then we looked at
the emotional toxic load,

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.890 align:middle line:10%
as well, because that was a
very important aspect of it,

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.930 align:middle line:10%
as far as if someone's
in a state of stress

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.780 align:middle line:10%
or if someone's in a state
of anger or fear or jealousy

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.010 align:middle line:10%
or resentment.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:10%
Those contributed
to the toxic load.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:10%
And then the harmful
organisms was the other thing

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.710 align:middle line:10%
that we looked at, which
contributed and was associated

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:10%
with not only cancer, but
with every single disease

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.957 align:middle line:10%
we looked at.

00:25:32.957 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, you want
to jump off a bridge

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.880 align:middle line:90%
after listening to him.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:90%
But is he right?

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's the downside.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he's right on, 100%.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.882 align:middle line:90%
It's probably worse.

00:25:39.882 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:84%
You notice he said the
prescription drugs, too.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.460 align:middle line:84%
You're on-- all those drugs
we were talking about?

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:90%
You're on them right now.

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And I'm on them right now.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean I'm on them?

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You're on birth
control pills right now.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, I'm not.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah. you are.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It's in your water.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:90%
It's in your coffee.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, I
see what you mean.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:53.740 align:middle line:90%
People throw it in the--

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: And you pee it out.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.340 align:middle line:90%
You urinate it out.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.788 align:middle line:90%
It goes into the water supply.

00:25:57.788 --> 00:26:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- in the factory,
they're dumping stuff out.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Aren't they cleaning
this out of the water system?

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:02.988 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: No, you can't.

00:26:02.988 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:90%
It's in the ocean.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.310 align:middle line:90%
It's raining it.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.977 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we have
opioids, everything.

00:26:06.977 --> 00:26:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Glyphosate
and fluoride.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.470 align:middle line:90%
It's so toxic, George.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But that's the amazing
thing about the body.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
The liver has the
ability to purify.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And it not only has
the ability to purify.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.820 align:middle line:84%
It has an ability
to purify things

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that it's never seen before
because when it purifies them,

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
it purifies chemistry
by building blocks.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter if it's
never seen the drug before,

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's pulling out the
building blocks of that drug.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:31.397 align:middle line:84%
And the building
blocks are all the same

00:26:31.397 --> 00:26:33.800 align:middle line:84%
throughout nature, even
synthetic building blocks.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.570 align:middle line:90%
So the liver can do it.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:90%
That's why all the--

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.965 align:middle line:84%
I call it "locus of control,"
where you have control.

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't have control
over the birth control

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.612 align:middle line:90%
pills in your water.

00:26:43.612 --> 00:26:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, you don't.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's the society.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.037 align:middle line:84%
But you do have control
over your vitamin C levels.

00:26:48.037 --> 00:26:50.120 align:middle line:84%
You do have control over
your glutathione levels--

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And vitamin D--

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And vitamin
D. And Dr. Group

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:90%
said something very brilliant.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:84%
He said fear and jealousy and
anger and resentment and all

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:84%
the things that we know
intuitively are not virtuous,

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:84%
George, those are
all things that

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.690 align:middle line:84%
cost us longevity,
that cost us health,

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.580 align:middle line:90%
that cost us quality of life.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's one thing to say,
OK, there are the virtues.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's an unvirtuous
life, and you're angry

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're hostile
and all of that.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you're angry
and hostile, George--

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:90%
this is so ironic to me.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.050 align:middle line:84%
When you're angry
at somebody, whose

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:22.890 align:middle line:90%
blood pressure's going up?

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Whose immune--

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The individual.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yes.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:84%
It's so ironic to me how
when we hate somebody,

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:84%
we don't forgive somebody, or
when we're angry at somebody,

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:84%
it's our blood pressure
that's going up.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Can you see this?

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.030 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of crazy.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So understanding how to
control locus of control--

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:84%
apply locus of
control spiritually

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.800 align:middle line:90%
by plugging into the universe.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.150 align:middle line:90%
We are one with the universe.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:90%
We're connected to the universe.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:49.550 align:middle line:90%
This is quantum physics.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is it about
the body that heals?

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Wisdom, intelligence.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:90%
There's an intelligence in Gaia.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:90%
It's called Gaia.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.770 align:middle line:84%
There's an intelligence
in the universe.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.390 align:middle line:84%
The planets are all
perfectly aligned.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:84%
They never fall
off of their axis.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Cells know how to recover.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:84%
The cells of the bone
are stronger at the point

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.345 align:middle line:90%
of the break after the break.

00:28:12.345 --> 00:28:13.970 align:middle line:84%
We recover not-- we
don't just recover.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:90%
We recover stronger and better.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a theme throughout
nature, self-repair, growth.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.190 align:middle line:84%
It's part of something called
systems "systems theory."

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Systems theory is
a physics concept.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But as we said earlier how
underneath chemistry is

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:31.760 align:middle line:84%
physics, systems theory
underlies biochemistry.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
body is a system.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.180 align:middle line:90%
The cells are a system.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything is a system, and it
has a certain way of growing.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And the way systems
work is energy

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.860 align:middle line:90%
gets inputted into the system.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.970 align:middle line:84%
If the system's healthy,
it transduces that energy

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and produces
something beneficial.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.778 align:middle line:84%
If the system is not
healthy, it doesn't do that.

00:28:51.778 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And how do if
it's healthy or not?

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: How you-- your
energy, your joie de vivre.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:59.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we know we're healthy
better than a doctor knows

00:28:59.010 --> 00:28:59.810 align:middle line:90%
if we're healthy.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:02.628 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Another thing Dr.
Group said that was really cool,

00:29:02.628 --> 00:29:03.530 align:middle line:90%
he said--

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.110 align:middle line:90%
he was almost flip about it.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, you can
learn a lot of things

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:90%
by talking to your patient.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Heck yes.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Today, doctors take your blood,
and they look at the numbers.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.020 align:middle line:90%
And they see your scores.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And they go to the book,
and it's all numbers .

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:84%
What I do when I'm working
with a patient, I say,

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.310 align:middle line:90%
how's your digestive system?

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.810 align:middle line:90%
How are your bowel movements?

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:90%
What does your skin look like?

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:26.760 align:middle line:90%
How do you handle--

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:90%
how do you sleep?

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.143 align:middle line:84%
How do you handle
stress in your life?

00:29:29.143 --> 00:29:31.790 align:middle line:84%
These are much more important
than your blood sugar.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.190 align:middle line:84%
People tell me, oh
my god, I have--

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:90%
my nails are breaking.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:90%
My skin is dry.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.930 align:middle line:90%
My hair is falling out.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And I went and had
my thyroid test,

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and he said
everything was normal.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.118 align:middle line:90%
I say, who cares what he said?

00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:47.160 align:middle line:90%
You had all the symptoms.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's wrong.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It's the thyroid
regulates all those things.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.057 align:middle line:84%
So you're guaranteed
hypothyroid.

00:29:51.057 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't need a test.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:90%
I can just ask you questions.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you
go to a restaurant

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:90%
and you eat the hamburger.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.737 align:middle line:90%
And you spit it out.

00:29:57.737 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:84%
You go, oh, that's the
most awful hamburger.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Call the waiter.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the most awful hamburger.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.313 align:middle line:84%
The waiter says, what
are you talking about?

00:30:03.313 --> 00:30:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Look at the menu.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:90%
"Delicious hamburger.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Best hamburger ever."

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:84%
You say, I don't care
what it says on the menu.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:90%
That's a lousy hamburger.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But we have such abdicated
authority and sovereignty

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.800 align:middle line:84%
over our own bodies to such
a degree, we say, all right.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.845 align:middle line:90%
I'm not hypothyroid.

00:30:19.845 --> 00:30:20.720 align:middle line:90%
I went to the doctor.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.970 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said my
tests are all normal.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:90%
You talk to your patient.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:90%
You look at your patient.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.440 align:middle line:84%
You see how he's
holding himself,

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.850 align:middle line:90%
how he's talking to you.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.680 align:middle line:84%
There are all
kinds of indicators

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that will tell you even
on the telephone more

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:84%
about a person's health and
help you adjust or modify

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.368 align:middle line:84%
or help them adjust or
modify their bodies way more

00:30:39.368 --> 00:30:40.660 align:middle line:90%
than a blood cholesterol score.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Ben, what's biohacking?

00:30:42.955 --> 00:30:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's kind of cool.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.870 align:middle line:84%
It has a kind of
ominous sound to it,

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:84%
but biohacking's
taking supplements.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.223 align:middle line:90%
Biohacking is meditating.

00:30:51.223 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:84%
By the way, meditation
is a really awesome way

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.253 align:middle line:90%
to control your body.

00:30:54.253 --> 00:30:56.795 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's look at a
little video about biohacking.

00:30:56.795 --> 00:30:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: OK.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Meet
a group of people

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.030 align:middle line:84%
from different corners of the
world, all linked by a desire

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to make their bodies and
brains function better.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:84%
They're inserting
technology under their skin,

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.540 align:middle line:84%
adopting extreme
diets, trying to change

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:17.885 align:middle line:84%
the biology they were born with,
some trying to live to 150.

00:31:17.885 --> 00:31:20.135 align:middle line:84%
>>MAN: I would be willing
to take pretty much anything

00:31:20.135 --> 00:31:22.480 align:middle line:90%
in order to improve my biology.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NARRATOR: Meet "Biohackers."

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's, of course,
supplied by the BBC News, which

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:84%
does a great job
creating some kind

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.823 align:middle line:90%
of educational kind of thing.

00:31:33.823 --> 00:31:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And it has a
very compelling message.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I like biohacking
in a simple way.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.512 align:middle line:84%
Eating is biohacking,
putting food in your mouth.

00:31:40.512 --> 00:31:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Biohacking means
getting into the system.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I was
talking about how

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.200 align:middle line:90%
it's all biochemical pathways.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Hacking is entering
into a biochemical pathway

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and making it go faster.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Basically, that's what it means.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:53.650 align:middle line:84%
You make a biochemical pathway
do what you want it to do.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I think breathing, oxygenating,
supplementing, meditating,

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.710 align:middle line:84%
exercising, sleeping, resting,
that's how I prefer to biohack.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you do
all these things--

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:09.670 align:middle line:84%
eating right, exercising,
meditating, supplementation--

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.290 align:middle line:84%
theoretically, what
should happen to you?

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You live a
long, healthy life.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.270 align:middle line:90%
And you'll die in your sleep.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.090 align:middle line:84%
You'll die at age
100, in your sleep,

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:21.790 align:middle line:84%
sitting on your rocking chair
with your favorite book.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:22.880 align:middle line:90%
And you'll just leave.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.670 align:middle line:84%
You'll just leave
your body, ideally.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if
there's an afterlife,

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.920 align:middle line:90%
you'll know you've left.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And if
there's an afterlife,

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.130 align:middle line:84%
you'll look back and
say, that was good, man.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And if there
isn't, who cares?

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's right.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.065 align:middle line:90%
But I think there is.

00:32:34.065 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But you are a
booster of supplementation.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.687 align:middle line:84%
That's what you do at
criticalhealthnews.com.

00:32:38.687 --> 00:32:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's interesting.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:40.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what I do at
criticalhealthnews.com.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.350 align:middle line:84%
It's funny because I don't
really like supplements.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm a booster of it,
yes, that's true.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage
people to supplement.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:90%
But I wish we didn't have to.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.330 align:middle line:84%
But don't you feel guilty
if you don't in a morning?

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I've got a regimen, Ben,
every morning, of working out

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:90%
four days a week.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I do the Royal

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Every morning
or four mornings.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.238 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Four mornings.

00:33:02.238 --> 00:33:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I do some treadmill at
night and stuff like that.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.400 align:middle line:90%
I supplement like crazy.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I must take 25 different--

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: All your life?

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, primarily
over the last 10 years,

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.240 align:middle line:90%
really over the last 10 years.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:84%
But one capsule might
have 20 vitamins in it.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But I take about
25 different sources

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.003 align:middle line:84%
for just about
every possibility.

00:33:28.003 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: And you
travel with them?

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.320 align:middle line:90%
You have a case?

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.487 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Turmeric and stuff.

00:33:31.487 --> 00:33:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Doc Wallach taught me that
from criticalhealthnews.com--

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Doc's amazing--

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where I have one of
those little pill dispenser

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.870 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:39.787 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Good for you.

00:33:39.787 --> 00:33:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I put
all the vitamins in,

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:84%
depending on how many
days I'm going to be gone.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: George,
not only is it going

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:45.573 align:middle line:90%
to add years to your life.

00:33:45.573 --> 00:33:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I feel guilty
if I don't do it.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Because you have
an inner wisdom that's

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.652 align:middle line:90%
telling you to do it.

00:33:50.652 --> 00:33:52.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you have any vices.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:53.527 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't
have any vices.

00:33:53.527 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:90%
But if you know any--

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've got a few.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:56.270 align:middle line:90%
I've got a few.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: All right.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So next time you do one of
your vices, whatever that is--

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.500 align:middle line:90%
we'll say Snickers bars.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if that is.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
a Snickers bar--

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Kit Kats--

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Kit Kats.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.010 align:middle line:90%
You have a Kit Kat.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:05.090 align:middle line:90%
So take a Kit Kat.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:84%
The next time you take a Kit
Kat, unwrap it really slowly.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:11.554 align:middle line:84%
And take that little piece
of delectable goodness,

00:34:11.554 --> 00:34:13.429 align:middle line:84%
that chocolaty goodness
that you like so much

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.363 align:middle line:84%
with that little crackle
you're about to hear,

00:34:15.363 --> 00:34:16.280 align:middle line:90%
all that anticipation.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Raise it up to your
mouth very slowly.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And listen, and you'll hear a
voice go, no, just like that.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Be very quiet.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.389 align:middle line:90%
It'll be your voice.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are you
saying, don't take it?

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: I'm just telling
you you have an inner wisdom.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:28.770 align:middle line:90%
We usually say, shut up.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And we go ahead and
eat the Kit Kat.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:31.530 align:middle line:90%
We go fast.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:32.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why they want
you eating fast.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.330 align:middle line:84%
That's why they call it
"fast food," because you've

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:36.409 align:middle line:84%
got to eat it fast because
if you ate it slow--

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You wouldn't like it--

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: You wouldn't
like it very much.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.510 align:middle line:84%
That voice would say, what
the heck are you doing?

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:90%
So they actually put softeners.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is hunger?

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have that
feeling when we don't eat?

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Yeah, hunger's
an interesting--

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is that?

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.967 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's great.

00:34:48.967 --> 00:34:50.909 align:middle line:84%
I lost 50 pounds
a few years ago.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:54.451 align:middle line:84%
And I did it by distinguishing
two kinds of hunger.

00:34:54.451 --> 00:34:56.159 align:middle line:84%
And I notice there's
two kinds of hunger.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:84%
There's the kind of hunger
where you have to eat,

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and there's the kind of
hunger where you want to eat.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.630 align:middle line:90%
And those are very distinct.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Binging.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: If you could
tease those apart,

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.490 align:middle line:84%
you will find that you don't
need to eat a lot of food.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:13.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you need to eat
shockingly small portions

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:90%
of food.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, next time you're
really hungry, George,

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:90%
truly, truly hungry, truly--

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like starving hungry?

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:22.428 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Like haven't eaten in
two days or a day or however

00:35:22.428 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:90%
long, as long as you've gone--

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:90%
10 hours, 12 hours.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.670 align:middle line:90%
Put food in front of you.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:middle line:90%
And then eat it slowly.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice
that as hungry as you

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:32.797 align:middle line:84%
were, within two or three
bites, you're not hungry.

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You're kind of stuffed.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You're fine.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:35.980 align:middle line:90%
You're fine.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.430 align:middle line:90%
And every morsel after that--

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Is it the head?

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It's totally the head.

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:42.320 align:middle line:84%
The head is wired for
calories because we

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.450 align:middle line:84%
evolved from a
situation where there

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:45.990 align:middle line:90%
weren't a lot of calories.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.410 align:middle line:84%
This calorie surfeit
that we have today

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.120 align:middle line:90%
is a 100-year-old phenomenon.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Not even-- it's about an
80-year-old phenomenon.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.010 align:middle line:84%
For millennia, George, you
know what our ancestors

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:56.330 align:middle line:90%
had to do for food?

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.678 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine what food
was like in a bad farming

00:35:58.678 --> 00:35:59.720 align:middle line:90%
season in the middle of--

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my god, horrible.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.598 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Dying of
starvation was routine.

00:36:02.598 --> 00:36:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can't think of--
there's not a worse way to die.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They loved potatoes.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Exactly,
the potato famine.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.670 align:middle line:90%
So we're wired.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.970 align:middle line:84%
We're the descendants
of ancestors

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:16.610 align:middle line:84%
that survived by
finding calories,

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:21.110 align:middle line:84%
by getting calories, ingesting
calories, and holding

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:90%
onto calories.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's our genetic heritage,
except for the last 80 years,

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.990 align:middle line:84%
we have a Snickers bar
and a candy machine

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:33.410 align:middle line:84%
or soda, 7-Eleven, French
fries every 20 yards.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's not a very
good combination.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.403 align:middle line:84%
And what it requires is
what you have in spades.

00:36:38.403 --> 00:36:40.070 align:middle line:84%
This is what you have
in spades, George.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:42.188 align:middle line:84%
You have discipline,
and you have willpower.

00:36:42.188 --> 00:36:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have to have both.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You're a master at it.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You have to have both.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's exactly right.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.380 align:middle line:90%
You have to have that.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.170 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have it, you are
going to be made mincemeat of.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: You will be crushed.

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's true.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.495 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: The world
will crush you

00:36:54.495 --> 00:36:55.995 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have
discipline and you

00:36:55.995 --> 00:36:57.330 align:middle line:90%
don't have willpower to do it.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.673 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:36:58.673 --> 00:36:59.840 align:middle line:90%
That makes a better species.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In anything
you do in life--

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Anything--

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Not just
supplementation.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Bingo, anything.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.750 align:middle line:90%
It's how to live life.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:07.250 align:middle line:90%
It makes a better person.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.750 align:middle line:90%
It makes a better species.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.070 align:middle line:90%
It makes us stronger.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have to learn
how to handle the mind.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.970 align:middle line:90%
And you said you did the Royal--

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Canadian
exercise, four days a week.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: A lot of
that is mental.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Royal Canadians understood--
like all military.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And let me tell
you what this practice is.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.730 align:middle line:84%
They give you a
series of exercises

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:30.590 align:middle line:84%
based on your age and a
level based on your age

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.240 align:middle line:90%
that you must hit.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Once you hit it, you're
supposed to sustain it.

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:39.202 align:middle line:84%
What I do is once I hit
it, I go to the next level.

00:37:39.202 --> 00:37:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Is that right?

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The next age bracket.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:90%
I lower myself.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: So you're younger.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So you're doing
a younger man's--

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm doing a
younger man's thing.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, it shows.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And I'm
getting by doing it.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: It shows.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.990 align:middle line:90%
It shows.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll bet you in many ways,
you're in better shape

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.130 align:middle line:90%
now than you were 10 years ago.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:55.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or 20 years ago.

00:37:55.195 --> 00:37:55.995 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Right.

00:37:55.995 --> 00:37:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I wish I knew today
what I should have known then.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It would've
saved all kinds of things.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:02.922 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: That's why we're here.

00:38:02.922 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:84%
If we can get somebody
to advance that or even

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.890 align:middle line:84%
participate in that kind
of program-- supplement,

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.560 align:middle line:84%
exercise, meditate,
oxygenate, rest, relax,

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.927 align:middle line:84%
access your spiritual powers
and your mental powers

00:38:13.927 --> 00:38:15.010 align:middle line:90%
and your emotional powers.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.700 align:middle line:84%
If we can get them to just
do it five years earlier,

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:84%
we can change the
world in a huge way.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were to take
one supplement, just one,

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.140 align:middle line:90%
what would it be?

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Beyond Tangy Tangerine.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been a formulator
myself for many years,

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and that is such an
exquisite formulation.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Above and beyond
that, I represent it.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.975 align:middle line:84%
So when you say "supplement,"
I think you mean one vitamin.

00:38:42.975 --> 00:38:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One vitamin.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Vitamin B--

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: Yeah, I know.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:46.320 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Selenium.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.280 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: George, you
like baseball, right?

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, I love it.

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: OK.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:90%
So if you can--

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tiger fan.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: If you could have a--

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.670 align:middle line:10%
If you could have a
team and I said to you,

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.740 align:middle line:10%
you could only have
one position filled,

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.390 align:middle line:10%
what position would that be?

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:59.190 align:middle line:10%
There's no way.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.220 align:middle line:10%
You can't.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.470 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: You need nine people.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:03.250 align:middle line:10%
>>FUCHS: That's
how nutrition is.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.420 align:middle line:10%
Nutrition is a team.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.520 align:middle line:10%
We isolate things because
we love to isolate.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.820 align:middle line:84%
We love to-- we're a very
reductionist society,

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and our culture's
very reductionist.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But you can't
isolate supplements.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.350 align:middle line:84%
If you had to pick
one, I don't even know.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Magnesium?

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: No, definitely
not magnesium.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.520 align:middle line:90%
It'd be vitamin C, probably.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or zinc?

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: No, it'd be vitamin C.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It would be C.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: It would be
vitamin C, probably.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.990 align:middle line:90%
But that's--

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.905 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Turmeric?

00:39:23.905 --> 00:39:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>FUCHS: Ah,
turmeric's up there.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I love that.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>FUCHS: I know you do.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Ben, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

We blog.

We post.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.990 align:middle line:84%
We have videos, lots of
great health information.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:40.960 align:middle line:10%
Look, we want you to be
around for a long, long time.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.670 align:middle line:10%
Just listen to some of the
words of pharmacist Ben Fuchs,

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:46.540 align:middle line:10%
and he'll give you
a few more years.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and thanks
for watching "Beyond Belief."
