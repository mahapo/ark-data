How many of us have heard
the phrase "I'm spiritual

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.705 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not religious"?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.007 align:middle line:90%
And what does that exactly mean?

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.478 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to meet a
holistic and spiritual author,

Thank you so much.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:11.905 align:middle line:84%
And my message is to
talk about spirituality.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.708 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, we talk
about spirituality and religion.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:15.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.711 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Far be it for us

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:19.212 align:middle line:84%
to knock all the various
religions on this planet.

00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:20.714 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what
you're doing, is it?

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:22.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: No, I'm not.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:25.252 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the -- I have
what's called the "ONE Formula."

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.654 align:middle line:90%
And the ONE Formula is O-N-E.

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:31.191 align:middle line:84%
O is about being open
to express and connect

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:34.728 align:middle line:84%
with this higher power, this
great spirit if you will,

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:36.529 align:middle line:90%
in the way you want to connect.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.965 align:middle line:84%
N is to nurture your
growth the way you want.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:42.402 align:middle line:84%
And E is to encourage
others and enlighten others

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.404 align:middle line:84%
and enlighten yourself
and encourage yourself

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.939 align:middle line:90%
to connect the way you want.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.377 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How come people
are now at this crossroads

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.512 align:middle line:84%
where they're trying to
distinguish themselves

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:56.683 align:middle line:84%
between organized religion
and just being spiritual?

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:59.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: I believe
it's because they feel

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.023 align:middle line:90%
that something is missing.

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.025 align:middle line:84%
They're looking inside
and they're looking

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:07.727 align:middle line:84%
at certain religions that
no longer serve them,

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
fulfilling --

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.531 align:middle line:90%
they're not feeling fulfilling,

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.401 align:middle line:84%
they're not feeling satisfied
with what's going on.

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:15.902 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Can that
atheist who doesn't believe

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:19.639 align:middle line:84%
in anything, can
they be spiritual?

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Well atheism is,

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:24.811 align:middle line:84%
they don't believe pretty
much in a higher power.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:28.048 align:middle line:90%
So can he or she be spiritual?

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:31.151 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's different
variations of atheism,

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:35.155 align:middle line:84%
so depending on the
variation, I would say yes.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I'm always
fascinated how people got

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.092 align:middle line:90%
into what they do.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:42.228 align:middle line:84%
You have made your career
now being a holistic

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:45.799 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual author
and researcher.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.501 align:middle line:84%
The little girl, Tina, did
she just wake up one day

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.103 align:middle line:90%
and say this is what I'm to do?

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: No, I did not.

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:90%
I was in a spiritual closet --

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.776 align:middle line:84%
I call it the "metaphysical
closet" -- for a long time.

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.278 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in a very,

00:02:58.278 --> 00:03:01.047 align:middle line:84%
very close-knit New
York City neighborhood

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:03.583 align:middle line:84%
where you had the synagogue
on one end of the neighborhood

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.085 align:middle line:90%
and the church on the other.

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:09.089 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt like even
though we had two different

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.291 align:middle line:84%
groups, I felt -- and
they had different --

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.527 align:middle line:84%
you know, one was waiting for a
savior and the other one had it.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.863 align:middle line:84%
And there were these
battles, internal battles

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.432 align:middle line:84%
and external battles
that were going on.

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And I felt as a little girl
that why are we battling?

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.072 align:middle line:84%
Who cares if you feel
there is somebody --

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.807 align:middle line:90%
a savior there are not?

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:30.076 align:middle line:84%
Some from a very,
very, very young age,

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.879 align:middle line:84%
I felt that we needed
to coexist.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.381 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
was raised a Catholic,

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.783 align:middle line:84%
and I always remember
my dear friend Reggie

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:39.886 align:middle line:90%
who was a Protestant, and he

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:43.023 align:middle line:84%
and I would talk a
lot about just life.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:45.025 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say, "Well,
you know Reggie,

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:90%
I've got to go to confession."

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.828 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "What's that?"

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:51.598 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, I have to go
and talk to this priest and I'm

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
in this little room
and he can't see me" --

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.002 align:middle line:90%
of course, I bet he could --

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:57.504 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:03:57.504 --> 00:03:59.005 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: --
"and confess my sins."

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:00.773 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Wow.

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:02.275 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens?"

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:03.776 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well,
then I say some prayers

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.645 align:middle line:84%
and I can go to heaven
if I die."

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.247 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "What do you do?"

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:09.716 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Nothing.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
We just say, you know what,
I did wrong, and I'm going

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.156 align:middle line:90%
to better myself," and I go on.

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:18.425 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "So you don't
have a priest or anything?"

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.126 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "No, not at all."

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:24.597 align:middle line:84%
At a very young age, I then
kicked this around and I said,

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:29.402 align:middle line:84%
now, how can Reggie get to
heaven not talking to a priest,

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:32.505 align:middle line:90%
and I, if I don't, I go to hell?

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.007 align:middle line:90%
How can that be?

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:37.744 align:middle line:84%
And so at a very young age I
began to question how this was

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.746 align:middle line:90%
and how it was balancing for me.

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:43.116 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that to be the
case now between spirituality

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.118 align:middle line:90%
and organized religion?

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: In what way?

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.121 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.722 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: In terms
of dictating certain things,

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:52.892 align:middle line:84%
where with spirituality
it's inside you.

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:54.394 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:56.329 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, I
want to make it clear

00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that you can be religious and
spiritual at the same time.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.636 align:middle line:84%
Religion, what that means
to me is that you belong

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:08.174 align:middle line:84%
to a certain institution and
you follow their rules and,

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, you can still
be spiritual and connect

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.047 align:middle line:84%
in your own way, but there's
these rules that you follow.

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:18.051 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality is more about
believing and being more open

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:21.788 align:middle line:90%
to coexisting with the universe.

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:25.024 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And at the
same time, that foundation I had

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:29.462 align:middle line:84%
in catechism class
and going to church,

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.431 align:middle line:84%
I think helped give
me a foundation.

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:34.467 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it gave me a better
understanding about, you know,

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.137 align:middle line:84%
intelligent design and
what might be out there

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:40.974 align:middle line:84%
in the universe and why we
might have been created.

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:42.675 align:middle line:90%
And I think it helped me a lot.

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:47.013 align:middle line:84%
But I'm much more spiritual
now than I am religious.

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:51.117 align:middle line:84%
There are some children who grow
up in families nowadays, though,

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:55.188 align:middle line:84%
that don't have the religious
background nor do they have the

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.789 align:middle line:90%
spiritual background.

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.792 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What are
they missing in their lives?

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:01.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Well, I
believe that we're all here --

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.997 align:middle line:84%
we're here to experience
different experiences,

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:05.565 align:middle line:90%
and what are they missing?

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they're
missing anything.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.704 align:middle line:84%
I want to give them this benefit
of the doubt that they will --

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:90%
they're exploring it their way.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, my children, they
are not religious.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.245 align:middle line:90%
They are spiritual.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:22.315 align:middle line:84%
And some people ask
me, are they missing

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:24.884 align:middle line:90%
that religious foundation?

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:28.488 align:middle line:84%
I really don't think so
because I see them so confident,

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.857 align:middle line:84%
and they are so easily
-- do they --

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:34.494 align:middle line:84%
they will express their
feelings about spirituality,

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:38.698 align:middle line:84%
where it took me so long to come
out of that metaphysical closet

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:44.304 align:middle line:84%
because I grew up in a very,
very structured Catholic family.

00:06:44.304 --> 00:06:45.972 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not bashing
Catholics here,

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:47.874 align:middle line:90%
it's just that's my experience.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.877 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have the
confidence, George.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:53.012 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the
confidence to speak up.

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:54.681 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, my children,
being that they're

00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:56.983 align:middle line:84%
in a very spiritual
environment, they'll speak

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:59.652 align:middle line:84%
up whatever they want to say
and however they want to connect

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:01.921 align:middle line:84%
and however they want --
whatever they want to believe.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.723 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, and I
have a checklist, you know.

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:07.794 align:middle line:84%
I look at people and I say,
how do they treat other people?

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:90%
How they treat themselves?

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.765 align:middle line:90%
What are their belief systems

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:16.769 align:middle line:84%
about how we got here
and why we're here?

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.839 align:middle line:84%
Questions I'm still trying
to answer for myself.

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.075 align:middle line:90%
That incredible quest.

00:07:22.075 --> 00:07:24.577 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, are
they a good person?

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:28.381 align:middle line:84%
I think those things, those
ingredients are more important

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:29.882 align:middle line:84%
than whether somebody
goes to church

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.384 align:middle line:90%
on Sunday or not, don't you?

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:32.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Absolutely.

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:35.755 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line: What does God
want -- or the great spirit,

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:38.825 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you want to call
this higher intelligence --

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.494 align:middle line:90%
what does he or she want?

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:42.996 align:middle line:90%
He wants love.

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:44.497 align:middle line:90%
It's all about love.

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.766 align:middle line:84%
It's all about loving
yourself unconditionally

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.402 align:middle line:84%
so that we could also love
others unconditionally.

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:51.738 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
whether you're going

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:55.308 align:middle line:84%
to a sacred building like a
church, a temple, or a mosque,

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:59.946 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, it really is,
you don't just be religious

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.714 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual in that
sacred building.

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:04.517 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
throughout your whole day,

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:06.019 align:middle line:90%
24 hours throughout the day.

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:09.622 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What do people
generally ask you when they chat

00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:12.625 align:middle line:84%
with you about spirituality
or religion?

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:90%
What are they looking for?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.563 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: They're
looking for what's going

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:20.300 align:middle line:90%
to make them and fulfill them.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.136 align:middle line:84%
You know, at the end of
the day, at the die --

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:25.738 align:middle line:84%
when you drop this body,
when that day comes,

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:90%
when you drop this body --

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.741 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Sooner than
later or later than sooner?

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:31.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: It depends on
how fast you want to leave.

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:33.546 align:middle line:84%
At the end of that
time, whenever that is,

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:36.282 align:middle line:84%
you drop your body, you
know, through all the work

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.918 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing -- I've
been doing past life regressions

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:41.554 align:middle line:84%
and future progressions
and all this energy healing

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:44.791 align:middle line:84%
that I've done with thousands
of clients over the years --

00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:49.028 align:middle line:84%
there are three questions I
have found that people will have

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
to answer to themselves.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.799 align:middle line:84%
And that would be:
Did I come here

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:55.101 align:middle line:84%
to do what I want --
what I needed to do?

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:57.003 align:middle line:90%
That's questionable number one.

00:08:57.003 --> 00:09:00.573 align:middle line:84%
Number two is, did
I make myself happy?

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:05.011 align:middle line:84%
And number three is, did I
live openly and spiritually?

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:08.648 align:middle line:84%
So if you can answer yes to
all those questions right now,

00:09:08.648 --> 00:09:10.683 align:middle line:90%
you're on the right track.

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:14.454 align:middle line:84%
If the answer is no, then that's
when I help those people, okay,

00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:15.955 align:middle line:90%
how can we get you happier?

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:19.225 align:middle line:84%
How can we really
tune into your passion

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:90%
and your purpose here on earth?

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.163 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How many world
leaders can't answer those the

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:26.232 align:middle line:90%
questions for themselves?

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Probably a lot.

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.235 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: All of them.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.737 align:middle line:90%
Maybe all of them.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:32.238 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Probably
a lot, yeah.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And I
think that's where the root

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.241 align:middle line:90%
of the problem is right there.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.077 align:middle line:84%
If they could answer those
and honestly change themselves

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:41.781 align:middle line:84%
to meet that criteria, I think
this would be a better planet.

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:44.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: It would be
such an amazing planet because,

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:46.452 align:middle line:84%
really, it's about love,
it's not about war.

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:48.654 align:middle line:90%
Work is never helped.

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:50.156 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: No.

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Never helped

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.159 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It's lined
the pockets of the few.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.162 align:middle line:90%
And that's greed.

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:57.663 align:middle line:84%
And that's really about
greed and power and all that.

00:09:57.663 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's really today
people that are waking up.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Just recently, May 29, 2013,
there was a Gallup Poll,

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.908 align:middle line:84%
and the results said that
77 percent of Americans say

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:12.879 align:middle line:84%
that religion has no influence;
77 percent, that's huge.

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's huge.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: That
is really huge.

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:17.383 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That is huge.

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:18.885 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: And also the
"Huffington Post" says that one

00:10:18.885 --> 00:10:22.755 align:middle line:84%
in five adults say that
they don't have a religion.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:25.658 align:middle line:84%
So there's 20 percent of
adults have no religion,

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:30.463 align:middle line:84%
and in that group, 30 percent
are 30 years or younger.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.632 align:middle line:90%
So this is a growing lifestyle.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.768 align:middle line:84%
SBNR, spiritual but
not religious is a

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:90%
growing lifestyle.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.971 align:middle line:84%
And you know, George,
this is why I came on --

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:40.506 align:middle line:84%
one of the reasons
why came on earth.

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:42.675 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all have
purposes here on earth.

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:46.012 align:middle line:84%
And one reason why I came on
earth is to write that book

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:48.047 align:middle line:84%
"My Spirit is Not
Religious; It's a Guide

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.615 align:middle line:90%
to Living Your Authentic Life."

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:52.018 align:middle line:84%
It's been in me since
I could remember.

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:56.956 align:middle line:84%
And the message is
clearly to be the peace

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:59.959 align:middle line:84%
and love you seek
one step at a time

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:01.627 align:middle line:90%
and live your authentic life.

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:03.629 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
How empty are people

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:05.531 align:middle line:84%
that don't have that
belief system?

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:07.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: That don't
have the belief system

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:09.135 align:middle line:90%
that I'm saying?

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.636 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: You know,
I don't I don't know --

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.639 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: See, I
would think they'd be empty.

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: I would
think that be empty; however,

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:17.944 align:middle line:84%
everybody -- I feel
that everybody is

00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:19.879 align:middle line:84%
at the right place
at the right time.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:22.849 align:middle line:84%
Okay? And they're
all learning and --

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.684 align:middle line:90%
you know, learning the way.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
take the detour,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.455 align:middle line:84%
and some of them
are right on target.

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:30.957 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: The
path not taken, huh?

00:11:30.957 --> 00:11:32.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Exactly.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You've got
to be careful with them.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.963 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:36.963 --> 00:11:38.464 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Well, I just --

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:39.966 align:middle line:84%
I find it amazing
that people can't just

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:41.467 align:middle line:84%
on any given night just
walk around outside,

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:45.404 align:middle line:84%
look at the stars, and not try
to wonder, how did this happen?

00:11:45.404 --> 00:11:46.906 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:48.407 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Why is it here?

00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:49.909 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
a purpose for this.

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:90%
This is just not a fluke.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.912 align:middle line:90%
It's not an accident.

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:55.948 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in this audience right
here, I'm sure, at any point

00:11:55.948 --> 00:11:59.252 align:middle line:84%
in their lives probably asked
themselves that same question.

00:11:59.252 --> 00:12:00.753 align:middle line:90%
What's this all about?

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:02.255 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing?

00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:03.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Exactly.

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:07.994 align:middle line:84%
And to be in this religious box
that it has to be a certain way

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and then recite, well, if
you're not following John 23:2,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.638 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
hell is really crazy.

00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:22.141 align:middle line:84%
Since my book has been out,
I've been receiving letters

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:25.611 align:middle line:84%
and e-mails from people
that are upset with me.

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:28.514 align:middle line:84%
They're wishing me that
I don't go to hell.

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.416 align:middle line:90%
They're praying for me.

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:31.918 align:middle line:90%
And that's great.

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.419 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting prayers.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:34.921 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.422 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Prayers work.

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:37.924 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: That's
fantastic.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.425 align:middle line:84%
And the funny part is, I
just recently got a letter

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:45.331 align:middle line:84%
from somebody in the US, and he
-- four-page written by hand,

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:49.635 align:middle line:84%
and two pages were websites
of where I need to go

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:52.905 align:middle line:84%
so I can practice
religion and Catholicism.

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:54.407 align:middle line:90%
And I look at that.

00:12:54.407 --> 00:12:55.908 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow.

00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:90%
I must've touched a button,

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.912 align:middle line:84%
otherwise he wouldn't be
handwriting all this, and,

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:03.082 align:middle line:84%
you know, finding my
address, and mailing it to me.

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So what I do with
those letters --

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.955 align:middle line:84%
I'm very grateful that I am
pressing some sensitive buttons

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:12.291 align:middle line:84%
-- and I'm putting those
letters and e-mails in a box.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:16.128 align:middle line:84%
I call it the "love box,"
because I really appreciate

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:18.831 align:middle line:84%
that they're reaching out,
they're voicing their opinion,

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:21.867 align:middle line:84%
and I know I'm a
catalyst for their growth.

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So I put this in the love
box and I pray for them.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.671 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Super.

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:27.773 align:middle line:84%
Let's take some questions
for Tina Sacchi from you.

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:32.445 align:middle line:84%
Who's got one as we talk about
spirituality or religion?

00:13:32.445 --> 00:13:33.946 align:middle line:90%
Okay. We'll take you.

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:39.318 align:middle line:84%
>> In most of the religious
traditions, there are aspects

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:43.489 align:middle line:84%
of it -- of them that people
would consider spiritual.

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:46.058 align:middle line:84%
Like, in the Islamic,
it would be the Sufis;

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:48.461 align:middle line:84%
or in Hebrew it would
be the Kabbalists;

00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:55.234 align:middle line:84%
or in India it might
be the Tantra.

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:90%
How do you look at the --

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:02.942 align:middle line:84%
do you look at this aspect of
the religion that's dogmatic

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:05.144 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
aspects in every religion

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:08.280 align:middle line:90%
that we would call spiritual?

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Great question.

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:11.283 align:middle line:90%
And I -- the latter.

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:15.154 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are aspects in
every religion that we can learn

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:20.359 align:middle line:84%
from and we can have an
eclectic-type of spirituality.

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:23.496 align:middle line:84%
Just like in the Catholic
religion there's a Father, Son,

00:14:23.496 --> 00:14:27.199 align:middle line:84%
and the Holy Spirit or Jesus
Christ, right, that's a triad.

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:30.636 align:middle line:84%
And then you have Shiva,
Brahma, and Krishna -- no.

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.805 align:middle line:90%
Shiva, Brahma, and --

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.306 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: -- Buddha.

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:35.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: -- Buddha -- no.

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.309 align:middle line:90%
No. No. Vishnu.

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:38.811 align:middle line:90%
I -- right.

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.312 align:middle line:90%
So you have the triad.

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:41.814 align:middle line:84%
There's a representation
of the each triad

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:43.315 align:middle line:90%
in different religions.

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:45.551 align:middle line:90%
So I believe in connecting

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.255 align:middle line:84%
to whatever you want
to connect with.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:53.592 align:middle line:84%
I believe in myself, I
believe in Krishna, in Rambha,

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:57.063 align:middle line:84%
I believe in Jesus Christ,
I also believe in Buddha.

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.931 align:middle line:84%
They're just different
representations

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:02.268 align:middle line:90%
of the great spirit.

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:03.769 align:middle line:90%
>> [Inaudible]

00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:05.271 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Sure.

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:10.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Religion, in many cases,
provides a moral foundation,

00:15:10.342 --> 00:15:14.613 align:middle line:84%
and if that is gone, how
do the young people get

00:15:14.613 --> 00:15:16.115 align:middle line:90%
that foundation?

00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:17.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:19.151 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I'm not asking
for religion to be gone.

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:23.889 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking that if you do have
a religion that you follow,

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:90%
don't oppose me or you.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Don't say your way
is the right way.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.231 align:middle line:90%
Peace and love, man.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, you want to
practice and believe

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.869 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus is the Lord, awesome.

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:40.573 align:middle line:84%
But don't say that just because
I don't believe in Jesus --

00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:44.176 align:middle line:84%
which I do -- that I'm
wrong and I'm going to hell.

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to follow
religion and have those rules

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and structure to -- really,
some people need rules.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.852 align:middle line:90%
Some people need structure.

00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:57.823 align:middle line:84%
I don't. I just -- I
love just being free.

00:15:57.823 --> 00:15:59.325 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.826 align:middle line:84%
I remember the 10
Commandments growing up.

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:03.829 align:middle line:84%
You know, thou shalt not
kill; thou shalt not steal,

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:06.065 align:middle line:84%
and I think much
like your question,

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:09.935 align:middle line:84%
it did help build a
moral foundation for me.

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:13.939 align:middle line:84%
It helped me as a little
boy create the difference

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:17.443 align:middle line:84%
between what was right
and what was wrong.

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Without that today in a growing
number of people who don't have

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
that foundation, how do
they decide what is right

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.552 align:middle line:90%
and what is wrong?

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:28.654 align:middle line:84%
How do they know, well,
maybe I should cheat and --

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
cheat on my test
because it's okay?

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.493 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, I'm going to steal
a few bucks from that store.

00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:35.995 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's looking.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.563 align:middle line:90%
It's okay.

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure the parental
structure is teaching that.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.735 align:middle line:90%
So where do people get that?

00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:44.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:45.771 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the parental
structure's not teaching that,

00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:48.374 align:middle line:84%
most likely, the parental
structure is not going

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:53.112 align:middle line:84%
to church or, you know,
following spirituality.

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:55.614 align:middle line:84%
In my house, I know I can
speak for my household

00:16:55.614 --> 00:17:00.518 align:middle line:84%
and my clients' households, I
teach my sons that the right

00:17:00.518 --> 00:17:03.322 align:middle line:84%
and the wrong way, which I
believe is right and wrong,

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:06.926 align:middle line:84%
and I teach them that always to
connect with their higher power

00:17:06.926 --> 00:17:10.461 align:middle line:84%
through meditation
whenever they feel flustered

00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:13.899 align:middle line:84%
and whenever they feel
that they need answers.

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:15.401 align:middle line:90%
The answers are within.

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:16.902 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I teach.

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:19.605 align:middle line:84%
I teach that the answers
are within, go within,

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:23.742 align:middle line:84%
and you'll know -- the inside
essence knows there's a right

00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:25.244 align:middle line:90%
or wrong.

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:26.912 align:middle line:84%
The inside essence knows
-- wants to be loved.

00:17:26.912 --> 00:17:29.181 align:middle line:84%
We all want to be
loved, don't we?

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.683 align:middle line:90%
All of us.

00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:32.518 align:middle line:90%
We all -- and we get angry.

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:34.019 align:middle line:90%
We get blameful.

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:36.589 align:middle line:84%
We get shameful and all that
because we're not loved.

00:17:36.589 --> 00:17:39.425 align:middle line:90%
It all boils down to love.

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:42.461 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's go out
to our Beyond Belief camera here

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:44.363 align:middle line:84%
and get a question
for you, Tina.

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:46.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Clint: Hi, Tina
my name is Clint.

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:48.033 align:middle line:90%
I'm from New York City.

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:49.802 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a religious person,

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:52.338 align:middle line:84%
but I am a very spiritual
person, and I'm always looking

00:17:52.338 --> 00:17:55.407 align:middle line:84%
for great ways to share
spiritual experiences

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:56.909 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Could you recommend some
really reliable ways

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:84%
to get spiritual
with another person?

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.882 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: That's
kind of the foundation

00:18:02.882 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
of what we've been talking
about; how do you do that.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:09.521 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, the way to
do that is to find your tribe,

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:90%
to find like-minded people.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.293 align:middle line:84%
You want people to raise your
vibration not degrade you.

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:17.463 align:middle line:84%
You want people to
nurture your foundation,

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.865 align:middle line:84%
nurture your values,
not judge you.

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:21.867 align:middle line:84%
So the one thing I
always ask people

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:25.471 align:middle line:84%
to do is declutter
people, places, things,

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.573 align:middle line:90%
and drama out of your life.

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:31.443 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, when you
declutter those things,

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:34.313 align:middle line:90%
then you will find who you are

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:36.081 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find like-minded
people.

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:37.583 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
I got to tell you,

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.752 align:middle line:90%
drama is very negative.

00:18:39.752 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:90%
It pulls you back.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:84%
It holds you back, and you
got to get rid of that.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:47.993 align:middle line:84%
You can only be in
one space or another.

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:51.697 align:middle line:84%
You can be in a space of
drama or negativity, and --

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.599 align:middle line:84%
and I know you don't
like negative people just

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:57.102 align:middle line:84%
like I don't -- you can
be in a negative energy --

00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:59.405 align:middle line:90%
a space or a positive space.

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:03.509 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is
to declutter the drama.

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:05.544 align:middle line:84%
Really, find your story
and if your story's

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.079 align:middle line:90%
to be positive, stick with that.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.781 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Used to
have a producer in St. Louis

00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:11.951 align:middle line:84%
when I was doing my local
radio show, poor guy, Howard --

00:19:11.951 --> 00:19:13.619 align:middle line:90%
and I've told him this.

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:15.654 align:middle line:90%
He has a cloud over his head,

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:19.191 align:middle line:84%
but that cloud he
pulls over on himself.

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:20.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:19:20.693 --> 00:19:22.761 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: He would come
into work, Tina, going, "Oh,

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:25.164 align:middle line:84%
things aren't going to
go well for me today."

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:26.665 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:28.167 align:middle line:90%
They didn't go well.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
he constantly had

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.671 align:middle line:90%
that kind of attitude.

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.441 align:middle line:84%
And to this day -- and he still
sends me a little text message

00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:39.411 align:middle line:84%
once in a while or calls
-- he still has that.

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:41.747 align:middle line:90%
And he has not elevated himself.

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:44.483 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't pulled himself
out of that situation.

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:48.554 align:middle line:84%
He ultimately got laid off when
I stopped on the local show

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:51.156 align:middle line:84%
and did Coast to
Coast full time.

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.992 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I was his protector.

00:19:52.992 --> 00:19:54.493 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:58.998 align:middle line:84%
But that attitude,
that cloud got him.

00:19:58.998 --> 00:20:02.334 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I've tried, I
haven't been able to get him

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
to realize he's doing
this to himself.

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:20:06.071 --> 00:20:07.573 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:09.074 align:middle line:84%
I believe -- and I've had
so many Howards like that

00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:11.977 align:middle line:84%
in my practice -- is
that there's a energy

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:15.781 align:middle line:90%
of not deserving in his life.

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.417 align:middle line:84%
There's somewhere he learned
that he doesn't deserve

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to be happy or for good
things to come his way.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:27.092 align:middle line:84%
So with a client like Howard, I
would go to the emotional root

00:20:27.092 --> 00:20:29.194 align:middle line:90%
of that or the cause of that.

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:30.696 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Right.

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Something happened --

00:20:32.197 --> 00:20:33.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Something happened.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:35.401 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
-- a long time ago.

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:38.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Whether this
lifetime or past lifetime,

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:39.705 align:middle line:90%
something happened somewhere,

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:39.905 align:middle line:84%
and he keeps playing
the same record.

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:42.708 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You're right.

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:44.209 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about the past lives.

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:45.711 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to another audience
question for Tina Sacchi.

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:47.212 align:middle line:90%
Who's going?

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:47.413 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:49.048 align:middle line:84%
>> How old were you when you
started to question your faith?

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:51.717 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: That's
a great question.

00:20:51.717 --> 00:20:53.218 align:middle line:84%
When I was three years
old, I took a trip

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:90%
to visit my grandmother.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.223 align:middle line:84%
And she lived on the top
of a mountain in Sicily,

00:20:58.223 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and the only way you can
go to visit her was either

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:90%
by done donkey or by foot.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:09.535 align:middle line:84%
So every morning, we would wake
up and we would open up the door

00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:12.938 align:middle line:84%
of her house -- it was a
two-room house, not that big --

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and there would be
people sleeping

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.977 align:middle line:84%
on the cobblestones
waiting for her to heal.

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.479 align:middle line:90%
She was a healer.

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:23.549 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a lineage of
multigenerational healers.

00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:26.485 align:middle line:84%
And so from a very, very
young age, three years old,

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:84%
I would witness people
going to church one moment

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:36.361 align:middle line:84%
and believing that, you know,
being in this sacred building,

00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:39.898 align:middle line:84%
that was going to help them
heal; and then the next moment,

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:42.201 align:middle line:84%
they'd be on my grandmother's
cobblestones.

00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:45.871 align:middle line:84%
So at a very, very young age,
I learned that there was more

00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:48.373 align:middle line:90%
than just a sacred building.

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:49.842 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Just a show of hands;

00:21:49.842 --> 00:21:54.313 align:middle line:84%
How many of you question almost
every day, what am I doing here?

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:55.814 align:middle line:90%
What's this about?

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:58.317 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many you ask
yourself that question?

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.385 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. That's a lot
of people, Tina.

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:01.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:22:01.887 --> 00:22:03.989 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You know,
it's this quest I think --

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.491 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yes.

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:06.992 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: -- to find
out what we're doing here.

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.494 align:middle line:90%
This is not a fluke.

00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:09.995 align:middle line:90%
It's not an accident.

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:11.497 align:middle line:90%
There's a purpose here.

00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:12.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And this is why we're here.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.935 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we didn't come here
to take this pleasure cruise

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:20.205 align:middle line:84%
and have it all sweet
and hunky-dory, right?

00:22:20.205 --> 00:22:21.707 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: It's work.

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:23.208 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: It's work.

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my goodness, it's -- I
believe it's really tough to be

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.211 align:middle line:90%
in this physical body.

00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:29.348 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about what we have
to do with this physical body.

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.183 align:middle line:90%
We have to sleep it.

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:32.684 align:middle line:90%
We have to breathe it.

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.186 align:middle line:90%
We have to feed it.

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:35.687 align:middle line:90%
We have to drink it.

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:37.189 align:middle line:90%
We have to poop it.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:38.957 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many things
we do with this physical body.

00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:41.527 align:middle line:84%
And then -- there
are many other things

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:43.128 align:middle line:90%
with the physical body, right?

00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:45.831 align:middle line:84%
-- we also have the
emotional body

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:49.168 align:middle line:90%
to really be happy and loving.

00:22:49.168 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the mental
body to feel balanced.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.872 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the spiritual body

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:55.908 align:middle line:84%
to really be connected
with source.

00:22:55.908 --> 00:22:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot we have
to do as a human person.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.412 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: My
granddaughter just turned 19

00:23:00.412 --> 00:23:03.382 align:middle line:84%
and she's into country
music now all of a sudden.

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:07.386 align:middle line:84%
And so she's back in St. Louis,
and I was here last night

00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:11.423 align:middle line:84%
with producer Tom, and
she sent me a text,

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:13.592 align:middle line:84%
and out of the blue I sent
her a text and said, "Hey,

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:16.728 align:middle line:84%
I'm having dinner
with Billy Ray Cyrus."

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:19.698 align:middle line:84%
And she got all excited,
and she said, "Put him on.

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Call me. Call me."

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.104 align:middle line:84%
So I had Tom call, and he
talked, and then she got smart

00:23:26.104 --> 00:23:29.308 align:middle line:84%
because afterwards, she said,
"Now, Papa, send me a picture

00:23:29.308 --> 00:23:31.410 align:middle line:90%
of you and Billy together."

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.947 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I didn't have
one and so I had to fess up,

00:23:34.947 --> 00:23:37.082 align:middle line:84%
as I was going to
eventually anyway.

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.951 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "You see.

00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:40.886 align:middle line:84%
I'm not as dumb as
you think I am."

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, 19 years
old, but bottom line was

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.794 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is seeking that
alternative in their own lives.

00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:50.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Absolutely.

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:51.797 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You know,
they're trying to look

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:53.298 align:middle line:90%
for that happiness factor.

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:55.901 align:middle line:84%
And not everybody
finds it, do they?

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Unfortunately,

00:23:57.402 --> 00:24:01.373 align:middle line:84%
I don't think everybody
finds it in this incarnation.

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:04.009 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we have --
I believe in reincarnation.

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:06.945 align:middle line:84%
I believe we come in
for different reasons.

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:12.818 align:middle line:84%
I believe unless we have a
360 degree viewpoint of being

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:15.821 align:middle line:84%
in a human body or
an experience,

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.723 align:middle line:90%
I believe we don't get it.

00:24:17.723 --> 00:24:19.958 align:middle line:84%
So maybe one time
you come in rich

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and another time
you come in poor.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.996 align:middle line:84%
Another time come in negative,
another time you come positive.

00:24:23.996 --> 00:24:27.132 align:middle line:84%
One time is female/male,
and so on and so forth.

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:30.469 align:middle line:90%
So to get -- to really get

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:34.406 align:middle line:84%
that enlightened status before
we leave and drop this body,

00:24:34.406 --> 00:24:37.409 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we all get it,
but we do get it indirectly

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:40.412 align:middle line:84%
where we're learning something
to raise our vibration

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:41.913 align:middle line:90%
from this bigger source.

00:24:41.913 --> 00:24:43.415 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Back
to the Beyond Belief cam

00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:45.017 align:middle line:84%
for another question
for Tina Sacchi.

00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:46.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Shannon: Hi, Tina.

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:49.388 align:middle line:84%
This Shannon from Texas,
and I was wondering

00:24:49.388 --> 00:24:51.723 align:middle line:84%
when you yourself
realized it's okay

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:54.393 align:middle line:90%
to feel God in different ways.

00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:55.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: That's
a very similar question

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:59.464 align:middle line:84%
to this wonderful
girl in the audience.

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:00.999 align:middle line:90%
It was at age three.

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:02.501 align:middle line:90%
At age three when I had that --

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:04.002 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
That's a young age.

00:25:04.002 --> 00:25:05.504 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:07.005 align:middle line:84%
At age three and
with my grandmother.

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:08.674 align:middle line:84%
And then there were other
examples as I went through life

00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
that it was okay to feel
God in different ways.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:17.382 align:middle line:84%
If I fast forward to the birth
of my son, my first son, I saw,

00:25:17.382 --> 00:25:23.288 align:middle line:84%
wow, this is just amazing how
having sex can create this

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:25.991 align:middle line:84%
wonderful baby and nine months
later, you know, you're there,

00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and this baby is breathing
and it's happy and it's crying

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.298 align:middle line:90%
and all the different emotions.

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:37.836 align:middle line:84%
And I said, there's got to
be a bigger way than to be

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:40.505 align:middle line:84%
in this box of rules
and regulations.

00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:42.007 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Super.

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:43.742 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have
sex to have a kid?

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:45.477 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:47.312 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: I think
that's what humans do, right?

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:48.814 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe.

00:25:48.814 --> 00:25:50.515 align:middle line:90%
Not there are other ways.

00:25:50.515 --> 00:25:52.217 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You talked
about reincarnation --

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:25:53.719 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: -- and that
you believe in reincarnation,

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.888 align:middle line:84%
and you mentioned
Howard, my producer,

00:25:56.888 --> 00:26:00.225 align:middle line:84%
that may be in a past life,
he might've had some issues

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:04.796 align:middle line:84%
or some problems that he has
carried over into his life now.

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:06.298 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:08.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: How does that
happen where he's had problem?

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.068 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
And carries it over.

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.071 align:middle line:84%
You know, I believe
that sometimes

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:15.874 align:middle line:84%
when we don't really
fully experience

00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and learn the example, like in
his situation, it's possible

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.283 align:middle line:84%
that it was a different
time and space,

00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:84%
that he was not deserving,
and he takes that energy

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.391 align:middle line:84%
into his being and brings it
over so he needs to explore it

00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:34.359 align:middle line:90%
on a different or deeper level.

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:35.961 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: He's
extremely negative.

00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:37.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Extreme --

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:38.964 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Extremely.

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:40.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Oh, yeah.

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:41.967 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You know.

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:43.468 align:middle line:90%
And people can sense it.

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't the only one.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.471 align:middle line:84%
You know, I spent half my
time trying to prop him up

00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:47.973 align:middle line:90%
and to keep him happy.

00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:49.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: And he's one
of your biggest teachers too

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:51.309 align:middle line:84%
because you're still
thinking about him.

00:26:51.309 --> 00:26:53.812 align:middle line:84%
And the negative
people, what do they do?

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:84%
They really help
us to love them.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.652 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to love
a negative person.

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:02.154 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
he's not a bad guy.

00:27:02.154 --> 00:27:04.222 align:middle line:84%
In terms of a person,
he's a nice guy.

00:27:04.222 --> 00:27:05.724 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:07.526 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And -- but you
just want to, like,

00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:09.594 align:middle line:84%
smack them silly
and say, "Wake up."

00:27:09.594 --> 00:27:11.096 align:middle line:90%
You know, "You're worthy.

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:12.597 align:middle line:90%
You're happy.

00:27:12.597 --> 00:27:14.099 align:middle line:90%
You're loving."

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:16.067 align:middle line:84%
However, sometimes
they just have to be

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:18.637 align:middle line:84%
that experience for
other people.

00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:20.138 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I'll
tell you a funny story.

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:23.708 align:middle line:84%
When I was leaving St. Louis
to head out for Los Angeles

00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:27.379 align:middle line:84%
and saying goodbye
to my local show,

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:31.049 align:middle line:84%
I asked Howard what did he want
as a going away present, and,

00:27:31.049 --> 00:27:33.418 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'd worked with
him for a number years.

00:27:33.418 --> 00:27:37.522 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "All I want,
George, is a Les Paul guitar."

00:27:37.522 --> 00:27:39.524 align:middle line:90%
That's all he wanted.

00:27:39.524 --> 00:27:43.361 align:middle line:84%
So he had the name of the
music store that sold it.

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:46.932 align:middle line:84%
And I called up the place, and
they said, yeah, it's $1800.

00:27:46.932 --> 00:27:49.868 align:middle line:84%
And I went, gosh, what a
going away present, but, okay,

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:52.337 align:middle line:90%
we'll get that for Howard.

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:57.209 align:middle line:84%
And on the night before I was
ready to leave I had to get

00:27:57.209 --> 00:27:59.678 align:middle line:84%
to the store to pick
up the guitar.

00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:04.616 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm driving out to the
store, I've got the $1800 on me.

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:08.787 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
possessed me but something said,

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:11.857 align:middle line:84%
you can not only win the
money for the guitar,

00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:14.793 align:middle line:84%
but you'll have some
extra cash to play with.

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:16.294 align:middle line:90%
Go to the casino.

00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:17.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Oh, wow.

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:19.297 align:middle line:90%
Uh-oh.

00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:22.033 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And so with
$1800 on me, I decided I'm going

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:26.638 align:middle line:84%
to hit this local casino
in St. Louis, I'll win --

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:30.475 align:middle line:84%
I'll keep Howard's 1800, and
I'll win another 1800 for me.

00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:33.011 align:middle line:84%
I have gotten the
guitar for zero.

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:34.913 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I thought.

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:36.414 align:middle line:90%
I go to the casino.

00:28:36.414 --> 00:28:37.916 align:middle line:90%
I sit down to play blackjack.

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:41.753 align:middle line:84%
And within an hour,
Howard's money is gone.

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:47.192 align:middle line:84%
I've got an hour left to go
back and pick up that guitar.

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:49.461 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the money on me.

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:50.962 align:middle line:90%
And I'm depressed.

00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:52.464 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying, oh, my God.

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:54.566 align:middle line:84%
This -- you know, I'm
taking off the next day.

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.067 align:middle line:90%
I've got to fly.

00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:57.569 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to see him,

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.137 align:middle line:84%
and he's really expecting
this guitar.

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:02.807 align:middle line:84%
I prayed. I said,
somebody kind of bail me

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:05.176 align:middle line:84%
out of this thing
one way or another.

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:08.713 align:middle line:84%
Tina, I had $40 left
on me, okay.

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Enough to get out of
valet and everything else.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:14.386 align:middle line:90%
And I said, go for it, you know.

00:29:14.386 --> 00:29:16.922 align:middle line:90%
You have nothing to lose.

00:29:16.922 --> 00:29:20.191 align:middle line:84%
Not only did I win
back the $1800,

00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:22.694 align:middle line:84%
but I won about another
thousand.

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I went immediately
to the store.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.033 align:middle line:90%
The guy was locking the door.

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:29.801 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "You
got to get me in.

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:90%
I need that Les Paul."

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.071 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Oh, yeah.

00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:34.573 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. It's for Howard."

00:29:34.573 --> 00:29:36.074 align:middle line:84%
And I went and I
got it and I got it

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:38.043 align:middle line:90%
to him in the nick of time.

00:29:38.043 --> 00:29:39.544 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's the power of prayer.

00:29:39.544 --> 00:29:41.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:43.315 align:middle line:90%
And it's also Howard's power.

00:29:43.315 --> 00:29:46.818 align:middle line:84%
Indirectly, what
did he teach you?

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: He taught you
that we're all connected, right?

00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:52.657 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected, and if you
-- and you just believed in him,

00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:55.493 align:middle line:84%
and you believed in him so much
that you really wanted to --

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:56.995 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: But I
was sweating bullets.

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: I'm
sure you were.

00:29:58.496 --> 00:29:59.998 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
mean, that was --

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:01.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: I'm
sure you were.

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:03.001 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:04.502 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
But in his case,

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:06.004 align:middle line:84%
something may have
happened in another life --

00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:07.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Or this time.

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:09.007 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: --
that was traumatic --

00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:10.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: -- and he
just carries it through him.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.013 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, sometimes
traumatic could be different

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:16.514 align:middle line:90%
degrees of it.

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:18.483 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, I always
had no problem with weight,

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:22.153 align:middle line:84%
and then I hit my 20s and I
had a problem with weight.

00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:23.788 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what
is going on here?

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:26.024 align:middle line:84%
What's going -- I -- why
am I having problems --

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:27.525 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
You're looking good now.

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:29.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: I'm --
well, what -- thank you --

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:33.798 align:middle line:84%
what happened was that I
did hypnotherapy on myself,

00:30:33.798 --> 00:30:39.404 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that when I was
age ten, we didn't have a lot

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:42.374 align:middle line:84%
of money growing up and the
ice cream man came around,

00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:43.875 align:middle line:84%
and I asked my mom
for ice cream.

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:45.510 align:middle line:84%
She gave me a quarter,
and I went out

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.112 align:middle line:84%
and I got the ice cream
sandwich, you know,

00:30:47.112 --> 00:30:50.215 align:middle line:84%
the vanilla with the chocolate,
you know, on the outside.

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:51.916 align:middle line:84%
And I ate that in
two seconds flat,

00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and the ice cream man was
still there, and I'm like, "Ma,

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.055 align:middle line:90%
can I have another ice cream?"

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Sorry, honey,
I don't have another quarter."

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.492 align:middle line:90%
And I was devastated.

00:31:00.492 --> 00:31:01.993 align:middle line:90%
Now, that was traumatic.

00:31:01.993 --> 00:31:03.962 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would say, how
can that be traumatic,

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.830 align:middle line:84%
but for a ten-year-old
it was traumatic.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:09.501 align:middle line:84%
And I made a promise that day,
George, that when I grow up

00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:13.638 align:middle line:84%
and I will finish college -- I
had the sense of doing that --

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:16.541 align:middle line:84%
finish college, I will eat
all the sweets that I want.

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:22.981 align:middle line:84%
And fast forward 22 years old, I
had problem even finding clothes

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:24.816 align:middle line:90%
in corporate America to --

00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I worked in corporate America 20
years, and in those days you had

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.389 align:middle line:84%
to wear the suits, you know,
with the tie and everything.

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:32.891 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Absolutely.

00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:35.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: So I had a
problem even finding that.

00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:90%
And so I started gaining weight.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.931 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what is going on?

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:43.601 align:middle line:84%
You know, for years I would
yo-yo diet, 20 pounds on,

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:46.004 align:middle line:84%
10 pounds off, and
so on so forth.

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:48.973 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line was that
when I did the hypnotherapy,

00:31:48.973 --> 00:31:52.243 align:middle line:84%
I went back to that traumatic
example of me being ten,

00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:54.913 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, this is
why I am fulfilling

00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:56.414 align:middle line:90%
that promise that I'll --

00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:57.916 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Who
would have figured?

00:31:57.916 --> 00:31:59.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.186 align:middle line:84%
So traumatic could be really
different for each one.

00:32:01.186 --> 00:32:02.687 align:middle line:90%
So that is what I'm saying.

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:05.757 align:middle line:84%
If there is an unexplainable
thing that's going

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:08.226 align:middle line:84%
on in your life that you keep
repeating a pattern, imprints,

00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:11.663 align:middle line:84%
belief, that you keep repeating
and you can't do it by yourself,

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:14.666 align:middle line:84%
it could be either this
lifetime or a past lifetime.

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:17.469 align:middle line:84%
So in Howard's case, I
would dig and see, okay,

00:32:17.469 --> 00:32:20.071 align:middle line:84%
where is this --
where did this start?

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:22.373 align:middle line:84%
Where did this start
and let's deprogram it.

00:32:22.373 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do you have to
find it in order to help him?

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: I don't
have to be aware of it,

00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:32.217 align:middle line:84%
and he does not have to be
aware of it, because it's all

00:32:32.217 --> 00:32:36.788 align:middle line:84%
about energy, and -- however,
sometimes the person needs

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:39.491 align:middle line:84%
to see it or feel it or
know or become aware of it

00:32:39.491 --> 00:32:41.626 align:middle line:90%
so that they can move on.

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:44.295 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: We know
that the power of prayer --

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:47.699 align:middle line:84%
some call it "mass
consciousness" -- works.

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:50.235 align:middle line:84%
We do experiments
on Coast to Coast

00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:53.638 align:middle line:84%
where we have manipulated
weather with the mind.

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:56.841 align:middle line:84%
People collectively get
together and they change things.

00:32:56.841 --> 00:33:00.845 align:middle line:84%
We do a little prayer session on
Fridays for people who write in

00:33:00.845 --> 00:33:04.983 align:middle line:84%
and say, you know, my uncle
is dying of liver disease.

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.484 align:middle line:90%
Can we pray for him?

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:08.219 align:middle line:84%
And then I get another
e-mail a month later

00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:11.589 align:middle line:90%
that says, my uncle's cured.

00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:14.559 align:middle line:84%
Bizarre strange things
have happened like this.

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:17.262 align:middle line:84%
What is it about this energy
force that's out there?

00:33:17.262 --> 00:33:19.297 align:middle line:90%
this power that we call prayer

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:22.667 align:middle line:84%
that collectively changes
things and alters them?

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:24.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Well,
we're all connected.

00:33:24.636 --> 00:33:26.137 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:27.639 align:middle line:90%
I have an example.

00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Can I show you an example?

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.642 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:33:30.642 --> 00:33:32.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Okay.

00:33:32.143 --> 00:33:33.645 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows about
Disney, right?

00:33:33.645 --> 00:33:35.146 align:middle line:84%
Yes? Do you know about
Winnie the Pooh --

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:36.648 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh, cute.

00:33:36.648 --> 00:33:38.149 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: -- and
Piglet and Eeyore and Tigger?

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:42.353 align:middle line:84%
So I call it, we are on the
Ferris wheel of life, George.

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:43.855 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: That's
where we are, right?

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:46.858 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Don't fall off.

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: The hub
-- don't fall off, right.

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:50.695 align:middle line:90%
Hang on with your tribe.

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:54.332 align:middle line:84%
-- the hub is -- let's
call it God for example --

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:58.436 align:middle line:84%
and we come from that
intelligence, that great spirit,

00:33:58.436 --> 00:34:02.407 align:middle line:84%
God, and then when we
incarnate on earth,

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:04.375 align:middle line:90%
we are like little spokes.

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:05.876 align:middle line:90%
Spokes, right?

00:34:05.876 --> 00:34:07.378 align:middle line:90%
We're always connected.

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Always connected.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.684 align:middle line:84%
However, we are different
interpretations of God.

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:18.021 align:middle line:84%
So we have Winnie the Pooh who's
a loving, wonderful character;

00:34:18.021 --> 00:34:20.892 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
Eeyore, just like Howard,

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:22.726 align:middle line:84%
always has that cloud
over his head

00:34:22.726 --> 00:34:25.762 align:middle line:90%
and very dismal personality --

00:34:25.762 --> 00:34:27.264 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: You know him.

00:34:27.264 --> 00:34:28.766 align:middle line:90%
That's him.

00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:30.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Exactly.

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:33.204 align:middle line:84%
And then you have Tigger,
the fun, bouncy personality.

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:35.405 align:middle line:84%
We all know people
like that, right?

00:34:35.405 --> 00:34:38.576 align:middle line:84%
And always wants to get
people going his way.

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:40.979 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
you have Piglet.

00:34:40.979 --> 00:34:44.682 align:middle line:84%
Piglet is always fearful
but goes along with a tribe.

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:48.086 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at
this beautiful --

00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:50.321 align:middle line:84%
all of us, we're all
connected, all of us.

00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And we are all a representation
of this beautiful God,

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.762 align:middle line:90%
great spirit intelligence.

00:34:57.762 --> 00:35:02.200 align:middle line:84%
If we can all hold
space and allow --

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.768 align:middle line:90%
and remember the ONE formula --

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:06.671 align:middle line:84%
to be open, everybody
expressing their way

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.172 align:middle line:90%
and nurturing everybody's --

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:09.674 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And they're
all different, aren't they?

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:11.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: And they're all
different, but their the tribe,

00:35:11.175 --> 00:35:15.914 align:middle line:84%
and when we do, when we coexist,
we can just have a fun ride.

00:35:15.914 --> 00:35:17.415 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:22.320 align:middle line:84%
We can have a fun ride together;
however, if we judge people

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.088 align:middle line:90%
and we knock them, that means

00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:26.491 align:middle line:84%
that spoke is going
to be broken.

00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:28.326 align:middle line:90%
This is not going to move.

00:35:28.326 --> 00:35:29.894 align:middle line:84%
This is -- we're not
going to be together.

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:31.396 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's right.

00:35:31.396 --> 00:35:32.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Absolutely.

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:33.131 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: That's a --

00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Do you
like my Ferris wheel?

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: --
that's a fun little toy.

00:35:37.402 --> 00:35:38.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Isn't it cool?

00:35:38.903 --> 00:35:39.103 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:35:40.405 --> 00:35:40.605 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It doesn't
play any music or does it?

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:43.408 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: We disconnected
it for this purpose --

00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:43.608 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Oh, you did.

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:46.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: -- but
it does play music.

00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:47.912 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:49.414 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: That
would've been nice.

00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:49.614 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Next time.

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:52.417 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
you know, prayer works.

00:35:52.417 --> 00:35:53.918 align:middle line:84%
People collectively
get together.

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:84%
But what about the individual
who doesn't have the benefit

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.921 align:middle line:84%
of being with a mass audience
and he or she wants to pray

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:58.423 align:middle line:90%
for something or themselves?

00:35:58.423 --> 00:35:59.924 align:middle line:90%
Will that work too?

00:35:59.924 --> 00:36:01.426 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Absolutely.

00:36:01.426 --> 00:36:03.728 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, that
individual is connected.

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:05.296 align:middle line:90%
Is connected to the hub.

00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:10.568 align:middle line:84%
So one great way to
really connect is --

00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:90%
does everybody know?

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:16.474 align:middle line:84%
It begins with an
M. -- meditation.

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:17.976 align:middle line:84%
See your audience are
very, very in tuned.

00:36:17.976 --> 00:36:19.477 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: They're sharp.

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:20.979 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: They're
very in tuned.

00:36:20.979 --> 00:36:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Meditation is
really a good way.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.984 align:middle line:84%
I can meditate anywhere -- at
an airport, a busy airport,

00:36:25.984 --> 00:36:29.887 align:middle line:84%
anywhere, just because I've
already trained my mind.

00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:33.124 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I close my eyes, my
conscious mind becomes inactive

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:34.659 align:middle line:90%
and then I start my breathing.

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:36.461 align:middle line:84%
Meditation's really,
really good.

00:36:36.461 --> 00:36:39.063 align:middle line:84%
It's a way -- prayers
attract solutions.

00:36:39.063 --> 00:36:42.667 align:middle line:84%
Once you pray to God
or Buddha or Krishna,

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.168 align:middle line:90%
whoever you pray to --

00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Or maybe yourself.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Whether -- your
higher self, yes, you can pray

00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:50.641 align:middle line:84%
to yourself because
yourself is connected.

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:53.244 align:middle line:84%
Prayers -- those prayers
will attract solutions.

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:55.646 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: How come
sometimes it doesn't work?

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:59.017 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
the parent who prays

00:36:59.017 --> 00:37:01.586 align:middle line:84%
over their cancer-stricken
little boy --

00:37:01.586 --> 00:37:03.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:04.589 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: -- and
the little boy dies.

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:06.858 align:middle line:84%
Or some other horrendous
thing happens.

00:37:06.858 --> 00:37:08.559 align:middle line:84%
Somebody gets fired
and they pray

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:10.895 align:middle line:84%
for a better job
and it doesn't come.

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:13.898 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
What's wrong with that?

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why -- it's
not their fault.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.168 align:middle line:84%
Why doesn't it work
for everybody?

00:37:17.168 --> 00:37:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:20.171 align:middle line:84%
Right. I believe there's one of
two reasons why it doesn't work.

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:24.242 align:middle line:84%
One is because sometimes
that cancer patient,

00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:28.012 align:middle line:84%
that's what they came in
here -- in this incarnation,

00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:32.483 align:middle line:84%
is to really learn what it
feels like to have a disease

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:37.655 align:middle line:84%
like cancer and to teach his or
her surrounding family members

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:40.858 align:middle line:90%
and loved ones to really --

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.461 align:middle line:84%
their lessons, whatever
their lessons are.

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:46.030 align:middle line:84%
So that would be one reason
why they doesn't works.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.366 align:middle line:84%
Another reason why
prayer doesn't work is

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:52.870 align:middle line:84%
because perhaps they still
have this worry energy inside.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.173 align:middle line:84%
And when you worry,
you block yourself.

00:37:55.173 --> 00:37:58.042 align:middle line:90%
So it's really about praying,

00:37:58.042 --> 00:38:01.679 align:middle line:84%
letting go of that
prayer, and letting God.

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.181 align:middle line:90%
Let go and let God.

00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:04.682 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Do
you have to believe?

00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:06.184 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to believe
in prayer?

00:38:06.184 --> 00:38:07.885 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to believe
that it's going to work

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.687 align:middle line:90%
in order for it to work?

00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:11.189 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: I would say yes.

00:38:11.189 --> 00:38:13.925 align:middle line:84%
If I'm praying, that
means I believe in it.

00:38:13.925 --> 00:38:16.894 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't believe in
it, it's like saying, yeah,

00:38:16.894 --> 00:38:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I'll do this but I don't
know if it's going to work.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.732 align:middle line:90%
Just like Howard.

00:38:20.732 --> 00:38:22.233 align:middle line:90%
We're picking on Howard today.

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:23.734 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Poor Howard.

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:25.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Poor Howard.

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:26.737 align:middle line:90%
Let's send him love, right?

00:38:26.737 --> 00:38:28.239 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You
know, you have a lot

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:29.741 align:middle line:84%
of these outside influences
that bombard you --

00:38:29.741 --> 00:38:31.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:32.743 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: -- every day.

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:34.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Absolutely.

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:35.746 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I
mean, and it's not easy

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:37.248 align:middle line:84%
in your day-to-day life to
pick up and make it happen.

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have all as human
beings have had our ups

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:40.251 align:middle line:90%
and downs in life.

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.752 align:middle line:90%
We've had tragedies.

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:43.254 align:middle line:84%
We've had good things
happen to us.

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:44.755 align:middle line:84%
We've had bad things
happen to us.

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:47.959 align:middle line:84%
I've learned the secret of this
is as the last Rocky movie,

00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:50.828 align:middle line:84%
once you get punched
down, the secret is

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:53.064 align:middle line:84%
to get back up and
to keep going.

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's so
important in life nowadays

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.003 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
face these obstacles

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.505 align:middle line:90%
but you have to keep going.

00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: You've got
to keep going, and, you know,

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.511 align:middle line:84%
when I -- when my book was
published just last month, gosh,

00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:08.012 align:middle line:90%
you know, I'm out there now.

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:10.047 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying my spirit
is not religious,

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:12.316 align:middle line:84%
and I'm getting people
from all --

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:14.685 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the
woodwork really trying

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:16.287 align:middle line:90%
to convince me otherwise.

00:39:16.287 --> 00:39:18.956 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of people --
I would say about 90 percent

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:22.727 align:middle line:84%
of the people that are listening
to my message, really thank me.

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:27.365 align:middle line:84%
They're sending me e-mails or
contacting me in other ways

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and saying, thank you
for writing this book,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.136 align:middle line:84%
because I knew I
wasn't the only one.

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you get that 10 percent
of people trying to convince me.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.243 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, again, declutter
those people, places, things,

00:39:39.243 --> 00:39:41.445 align:middle line:84%
and drama out of your
life, and who cares.

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:42.947 align:middle line:90%
I don't really care.

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:44.448 align:middle line:90%
I really don't care.

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:47.919 align:middle line:84%
If you don't want to believe
in spirituality or be part

00:39:47.919 --> 00:39:50.054 align:middle line:84%
of the SBNR movement
or lifestyle --

00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:51.556 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: So be it.

00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:53.057 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: I
really don't care.

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:56.427 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the energy or the
time to convince everybody.

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:57.929 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Somebody.

00:39:57.929 --> 00:39:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: I don't.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.932 align:middle line:84%
I always say I'd
rather relocate --

00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:02.433 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather relocate these
beautiful Rocky Mountains

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:06.270 align:middle line:84%
teaspoon by teaspoon then
to convince somebody, one,

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:07.772 align:middle line:90%
if they're not ready, or, two,

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:09.273 align:middle line:84%
if they don't want
to be convinced.

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.775 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: They
don't want to be ready.

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:13.778 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's take
some more questions for Tina.

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:15.279 align:middle line:90%
Who's got some?

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.781 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.282 align:middle line:84%
>> It feels like
everything you talk about,

00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:19.784 align:middle line:84%
I know it up here,
but I don't feel it.

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:21.285 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering how
do you get to that point

00:40:21.285 --> 00:40:23.955 align:middle line:84%
where it's not intellectual but
it's in your heart and soul?

00:40:23.955 --> 00:40:25.456 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So I would try to -- one step
is try to get out of your head

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.295 align:middle line:90%
and get into your heart.

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:32.797 align:middle line:90%
Your heart always knows.

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:36.367 align:middle line:84%
So one quick example would be to
place your hand on your heart --

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:40.671 align:middle line:84%
everybody can do this -- place
your right hand on your heart,

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:44.175 align:middle line:84%
right, and give yourself a
moment to close your eyes

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.810 align:middle line:90%
and fill in this blank.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:49.914 align:middle line:90%
"My spirit says blank."

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:52.950 align:middle line:90%
"My spirit feels."

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:56.854 align:middle line:90%
"My spirit's message is."

00:40:56.854 --> 00:41:04.362 align:middle line:84%
And if you start answering
like, I think my spirit says,

00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:05.896 align:middle line:90%
thinking is your head, right.

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:07.398 align:middle line:90%
You have to feel it.

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:08.900 align:middle line:90%
It has come with your heart.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.401 align:middle line:84%
Start with that type
of meditation.

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:12.036 align:middle line:90%
How did that work?

00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:13.537 align:middle line:90%
Worked okay?

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:16.274 align:middle line:84%
Yeah? And meditation
is really about --

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:19.844 align:middle line:84%
again, I can't stress
meditation enough

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:22.313 align:middle line:84%
and there are different
forms of meditation.

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:23.814 align:middle line:90%
There are guided imagery.

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:25.316 align:middle line:90%
There are breathing meditations

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:27.785 align:middle line:84%
or walking meditations,
team meditations.

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:31.522 align:middle line:84%
Pick the meditation that
really will help you go within,

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:33.457 align:middle line:90%
because you, my dear, know --

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:35.526 align:middle line:84%
you know yourself the
best, don't you think?

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:37.929 align:middle line:84%
Out of this whole
planet or this universe,

00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:39.430 align:middle line:90%
you know yourself the best.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:42.933 align:middle line:84%
So when you start thinking,
that's when you make

00:41:42.933 --> 00:41:44.802 align:middle line:90%
that disconnect, okay.

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:46.304 align:middle line:90%
So go into your heart.

00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:47.872 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's take
another Beyond Belief question

00:41:47.872 --> 00:41:49.373 align:middle line:90%
for Tina.

00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:50.875 align:middle line:84%
Let's flip the switch
and here we go.

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:54.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Pamela: Hey, Tina, this
is Pamela from Massachusetts,

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:57.381 align:middle line:84%
and I want to know if a
person can be spiritual

00:41:57.381 --> 00:42:00.751 align:middle line:90%
and religious at the same time?

00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:02.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Absolutely --

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:03.754 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Sure they can.

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:05.256 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:06.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: -- yes.

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.259 align:middle line:84%
Yes, absolutely,
you can be religious

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:09.760 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual the same time.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.262 align:middle line:90%
So being religious, to me

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.763 align:middle line:84%
that means there are some
rules you follow along

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:15.199 align:middle line:84%
with this institution that
you belong with; however,

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:20.171 align:middle line:84%
you still allow other people
to practice in their own way.

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:21.672 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:23.174 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Without
putting them down.

00:42:23.174 --> 00:42:24.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Exactly.

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:26.177 align:middle line:90%
Without putting them down.

00:42:26.177 --> 00:42:27.678 align:middle line:84%
And being spiritual
would be to, okay,

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not following these
rules and regulations,

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.216 align:middle line:90%
but I am expressing it my way.

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:37.955 align:middle line:84%
So if I want to connect
with the tree, I can connect

00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:39.457 align:middle line:84%
with the tree and
be spiritual, right.

00:42:39.457 --> 00:42:41.559 align:middle line:90%
I can hug a tree.

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:44.495 align:middle line:90%
I can lay under a tree.

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:47.031 align:middle line:90%
I can meditate with a tree.

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:50.768 align:middle line:84%
Another way would be
to use crystals --

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:52.269 align:middle line:90%
how many of you use crystals?

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:55.139 align:middle line:84%
There are crystals all over
this beautiful Gaiam facility --

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:57.641 align:middle line:84%
is really connect the
energy of crystals.

00:42:57.641 --> 00:42:59.243 align:middle line:90%
You may wear crystals.

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:01.579 align:middle line:90%
You may hold them in your hand.

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:04.048 align:middle line:84%
You may surround your
beautiful environment.

00:43:04.048 --> 00:43:06.283 align:middle line:90%
So being spiritual means that.

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:10.821 align:middle line:90%
Another way is to use beads.

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:13.958 align:middle line:84%
You can use mala beads,
you can use rosary beads,

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:17.895 align:middle line:84%
you can wear the beads,
you can hold the beads,

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:19.397 align:middle line:90%
you can do it whatever you want.

00:43:19.397 --> 00:43:20.898 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
What do they do?

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: The mala beads?

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.901 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:25.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: These
mala beads gives you a way

00:43:25.403 --> 00:43:26.904 align:middle line:90%
to meditate and go within.

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:29.407 align:middle line:84%
So mala beads have 108 beads,
which is very auspicious number,

00:43:29.407 --> 00:43:33.411 align:middle line:84%
and you chant -- normally,
people with chant --

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:37.014 align:middle line:84%
each one a certain -- so
like your friend Howard --

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:40.084 align:middle line:84%
we're going to use
him -- "I am happy.

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:41.585 align:middle line:90%
I am happy.

00:43:41.585 --> 00:43:43.087 align:middle line:90%
I am happy.

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:44.588 align:middle line:90%
I am happy."

00:43:44.588 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like you fake it to
you believe it type thing.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, just putting
that energy present tense,

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.861 align:middle line:90%
present tense, and positive.

00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:57.001 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you chant
that "I am happy" 108 times,

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:59.703 align:middle line:84%
you're putting that energy of I
am happy into your [inaudible].

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:01.205 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Well,

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:02.706 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting how the
Catholic Church uses rosary

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:04.208 align:middle line:90%
beads to do the same thing.

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:05.709 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.211 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.712 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Let's take
another question for Tina.

00:44:08.712 --> 00:44:10.214 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:12.216 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying that
religion basically is taught

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:17.455 align:middle line:84%
to an individual, but
spirituality comes naturally?

00:44:17.455 --> 00:44:20.958 align:middle line:84%
Is that what I'm beginning
to understand from you?

00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:22.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Well,
that's my point of view.

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:24.094 align:middle line:90%
And my point of view is,

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:27.264 align:middle line:84%
religion was put
together by man.

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:31.402 align:middle line:84%
Okay? And really
for good intentions.

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:34.939 align:middle line:84%
So we can be cohesive and
create this wonderful community

00:44:34.939 --> 00:44:39.243 align:middle line:84%
and this wonderful tribe;
however, sometimes, someway,

00:44:39.243 --> 00:44:41.979 align:middle line:84%
somehow along thousands
of years,

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:45.649 align:middle line:90%
it became about power and fear.

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:49.987 align:middle line:84%
Right? But you know some sacred
books have been changed, right?

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:53.524 align:middle line:84%
And some of these books --
I can talk about the Bible.

00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:57.328 align:middle line:84%
The New Testaments were
written hundreds of years

00:44:57.328 --> 00:45:00.264 align:middle line:90%
after things happened.

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:01.765 align:middle line:90%
Now, can you write something

00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:04.068 align:middle line:84%
about ten years ago
in full detail?

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:05.569 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Nope.

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:07.438 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: So think
about 100 years later.

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So the premise of religion
and Bibles and sacred books

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:19.917 align:middle line:84%
and sacred temples and buildings
is really about love; however,

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:22.753 align:middle line:84%
it's really about
spirituality that I feel.

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:24.788 align:middle line:90%
Did that answer your question?

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.791 align:middle line:90%
It does to some extent.

00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:29.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: What
is it that --

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got a sister
that's an atheist --

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Oh, okay.

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:37.101 align:middle line:84%
>> -- and she doesn't
believe in anything.

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:39.637 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, let me
put some words in his mouth.

00:45:39.637 --> 00:45:41.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Go ahead.

00:45:41.539 --> 00:45:45.109 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Why
doesn't an atheist believe?

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:47.111 align:middle line:90%
in anything?

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:50.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: An
atheist doesn't believe it.

00:45:50.614 --> 00:45:53.717 align:middle line:84%
Most atheists want
proven scientific facts,

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:57.121 align:middle line:84%
wants to see God,
wants to really see

00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:59.924 align:middle line:90%
and have statistics on it.

00:45:59.924 --> 00:46:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Most atheists are that way.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.061 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it is.

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:05.563 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I want to
talk more about why we're here.

00:46:05.563 --> 00:46:08.933 align:middle line:84%
Don't touch your dial wherever
you may be watching Beyond

00:46:08.933 --> 00:46:11.201 align:middle line:84%
Belief because we
will be right back.

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:17.508 align:middle line:90%
[ Applause ]

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:19.009 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back
to Beyond Belief.

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:21.512 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory along
with Tina Sacchi as we talk

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:26.150 align:middle line:84%
about spirituality versus
religion or/and religion

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.018 align:middle line:84%
and we've got a couple
volunteers we're going

00:46:28.018 --> 00:46:29.520 align:middle line:90%
to bring up.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.155 align:middle line:90%
Come on up, and Tina's going

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:33.057 align:middle line:84%
to do something very
special with them.

00:46:33.057 --> 00:46:34.558 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do to them?

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Well,
I'm going to demonstrate

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.129 align:middle line:90%
that we truly are connected.

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:43.267 align:middle line:84%
And maybe with the
atheist people out there,

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:46.136 align:middle line:84%
like your sister in
the audience there,

00:46:46.136 --> 00:46:49.273 align:middle line:90%
maybe you can show this example.

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:51.609 align:middle line:84%
So what I have is
an energy ball.

00:46:51.609 --> 00:46:55.012 align:middle line:84%
Have any of you seen
an energy ball before?

00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:56.513 align:middle line:84%
So here we are --
what is your name?

00:46:56.513 --> 00:46:58.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Laura: Laura.

00:46:58.015 --> 00:46:59.516 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Hi, Laura.

00:46:59.516 --> 00:47:01.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Sarah: Sarah.

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:02.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Hi, Sarah.

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:04.021 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
hold hands, okay.

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.522 align:middle line:90%
Hold hands.

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:07.024 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:10.561 align:middle line:84%
Now, Laura, if you can just
touch that magnetic thing.

00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:13.197 align:middle line:90%
Okay, now keep touching it.

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:17.001 align:middle line:90%
Now, put your hand like that.

00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:20.638 align:middle line:90%
Okay. So why is this happening?

00:47:20.638 --> 00:47:22.206 align:middle line:90%
We are energy.

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:26.844 align:middle line:84%
We come from that
energy hub, okay.

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:28.879 align:middle line:90%
We're all energy here.

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:32.716 align:middle line:84%
So when we start judging people
-- let's hold hands again,

00:47:32.716 --> 00:47:36.120 align:middle line:84%
okay -- when we start judging
people, that's what happens.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:41.158 align:middle line:84%
When we express love, we
keep that energy rolling.

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:47.398 align:middle line:84%
When we doubt and become
very headstrong, when we tune

00:47:47.398 --> 00:47:48.899 align:middle line:90%
into our heart and our spirit.

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:50.934 align:middle line:90%
You see that?

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:53.837 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It sounds
like The Fly going, "Help me."

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:55.873 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:57.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: So --

00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:58.876 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
It's all connected.

00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:00.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: We're
all connected.

00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:01.879 align:middle line:90%
So really it's about coexisting.

00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:03.380 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
expressing it your way.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.282 align:middle line:90%
So let's do it one more time.

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:08.585 align:middle line:90%
And I love you and I love you,

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:11.088 align:middle line:84%
and the way you express
your spirituality is great;

00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:15.693 align:middle line:84%
however if I hate you for --
that you're going to go to hell,

00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:18.262 align:middle line:84%
okay, because you're
not believing it my way,

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:20.931 align:middle line:84%
there you go, we start
separating each other.

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:23.767 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about
getting that energy flow,

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:27.271 align:middle line:84%
letting it flow, letting
it move, let's be the peace

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and love we really
want in this word.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.443 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
Fascinating demonstration.

00:48:32.443 --> 00:48:33.944 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Thank you.

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:35.446 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Thank you.

00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:36.947 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:38.449 align:middle line:84%
How does that work --
actually, technically?

00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Scientifically,
how it works?

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.452 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:48:41.452 --> 00:48:42.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: It's really
about conducting energy.

00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:44.455 align:middle line:90%
We are energy.

00:48:44.455 --> 00:48:45.956 align:middle line:84%
So there's two magnetic
strips and --

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:47.458 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Does
that work with us?

00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:48.959 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yes.

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:50.461 align:middle line:84%
Touch it, but we
have to hold hands.

00:48:50.461 --> 00:48:51.962 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
[Inaudible] don't hold hands,

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:53.464 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work, right?

00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:54.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:56.467 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: The
minute we hold -- how weird.

00:48:56.467 --> 00:48:57.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: And
we just -- finger.

00:48:57.968 --> 00:48:59.470 align:middle line:90%
ET.

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:00.971 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What
if I touch your nose?

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Go
ahead, try it.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.142 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:07.377 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: One more time.

00:49:07.377 --> 00:49:10.514 align:middle line:90%
[ Beeping ]

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:12.049 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: You like it?

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:15.052 align:middle line:90%
Do you want it?

00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:16.553 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: I don't know
if I can take it on a plane.

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: You can --
you can -- that's a great --

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:19.556 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: It
looks like it's made

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:21.058 align:middle line:90%
with a ping-pong ball, is it?

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:22.559 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: It looks like
a ping-pong ball but it's not.

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.261 align:middle line:84%
It's called an energy
ball, that's what it is.

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:27.831 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Which brings
us back to our initial question

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:30.601 align:middle line:84%
about spirituality,
about belief,

00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:34.404 align:middle line:84%
about what this is all
about, why we're here.

00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:37.274 align:middle line:84%
Will we ever really
get this answer?

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:39.109 align:middle line:90%
We all have our own suspicions.

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:45.048 align:middle line:84%
My personal suspicion is,
we're here to perfect ourselves

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:49.253 align:middle line:84%
for what is after
this existence.

00:49:49.253 --> 00:49:50.788 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know for sure.

00:49:50.788 --> 00:49:52.289 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:53.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: What
are we doing here?

00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:55.659 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this
is Earth school.

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.728 align:middle line:84%
How many believe
this is Earth school?

00:49:57.728 --> 00:49:59.229 align:middle line:90%
Look. Look at this.

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:02.232 align:middle line:90%
Okay. So we're here to learn.

00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:05.302 align:middle line:84%
We're here to learn, and, again,
it's really about love, George.

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:06.804 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
loving ourselves.

00:50:06.804 --> 00:50:08.672 align:middle line:90%
Can you truly love yourself?

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:10.174 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:50:10.174 --> 00:50:11.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:13.977 align:middle line:84%
And how many people
can say that?

00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:16.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people can't say
that, because they're going,

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.116 align:middle line:84%
they're struggling, whether
they're struggling financially

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.753 align:middle line:84%
or relationships or whatever;
however, if you're struggling

00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:25.455 align:middle line:84%
in your life, you
got to make a change,

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:27.558 align:middle line:84%
because whatever's happening
now is not really working,

00:50:27.558 --> 00:50:29.059 align:middle line:90%
so there's got to be a change.

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:30.561 align:middle line:90%
So you can really love yourself.

00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:32.796 align:middle line:84%
So we're here to love
ourselves unconditionally.

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:34.832 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Must you love
yourself before you can love

00:50:34.832 --> 00:50:36.400 align:middle line:90%
somebody else?

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: I would say yes.

00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:40.437 align:middle line:84%
I would say yes, because
if you don't love yourself,

00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:42.639 align:middle line:84%
what you have there
to give others.

00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:45.809 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you're
giving out is not pure.

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:48.312 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What do you
recommend that people do --

00:50:48.312 --> 00:50:50.814 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to get your
website out for folks --

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:52.316 align:middle line:90%
but what do they do if they want

00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:55.419 align:middle line:84%
to start perfecting this
spirituality in themselves?

00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Yeah.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.422 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
What are the steps?

00:50:58.422 --> 00:50:59.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: The first step
is to recognize that you want

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.425 align:middle line:90%
to make a change, okay.

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:02.926 align:middle line:90%
You have to want to change.

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:05.829 align:middle line:84%
You can't just, you
know, not want it.

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:09.132 align:middle line:84%
And, again, go within
however you will --

00:51:09.132 --> 00:51:11.735 align:middle line:84%
however it means to you
to go within, whether it's

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:13.537 align:middle line:84%
through nature, through
meditation, whatever.

00:51:13.537 --> 00:51:15.038 align:middle line:90%
Find your tribe.

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:18.342 align:middle line:84%
I do have a community that
I'm setting up right now.

00:51:18.342 --> 00:51:22.045 align:middle line:84%
It's called myspiritis.com,
and everybody can get

00:51:22.045 --> 00:51:25.315 align:middle line:84%
that information on my website
which is TinaSacchi.com.

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:26.817 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And
you better spell it.

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:28.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Okay.

00:51:28.318 --> 00:51:30.888 align:middle line:84%
Tina Sacchi is Tina,
t-i-n-a, s-a-c-c-h-i.

00:51:30.888 --> 00:51:34.057 align:middle line:84%
And also there another
website that will get you

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:37.461 align:middle line:84%
to my website is
mybesthealthtips.com.

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:39.062 align:middle line:90%
So find your tribe.

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:41.398 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm creating;
I'm creating a tribe.

00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:45.369 align:middle line:84%
I've had a tribe for -- we're
going into our 16th series,

00:51:45.369 --> 00:51:47.738 align:middle line:90%
and I've been mentoring them,

00:51:47.738 --> 00:51:49.573 align:middle line:84%
but then again, they're
mentoring me.

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:51.074 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm learning from them.

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:52.709 align:middle line:84%
They're learning from
me, so we're together.

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:55.512 align:middle line:84%
And they have -- they're very,
very important in my life

00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:58.248 align:middle line:84%
because they have
raised my vibration

00:51:58.248 --> 00:51:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and I've helped them
raise theirs,

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:03.654 align:middle line:84%
and we've been traveling this
earth and retreating everywhere.

00:52:03.654 --> 00:52:06.523 align:middle line:90%
But most of them are in Arizona.

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:08.025 align:middle line:90%
That's where I live.

00:52:08.025 --> 00:52:09.526 align:middle line:90%
So now I want to take it global.

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:11.762 align:middle line:84%
I want to take it worldwide,
and we're going to come

00:52:11.762 --> 00:52:15.632 align:middle line:84%
through this community of
myspiritis.com and so join me

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:17.134 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be
part of my tribe.

00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:18.635 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: What
has been the reaction

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.404 align:middle line:84%
to "My Spirit is Not
Religious," your work?

00:52:20.404 --> 00:52:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: Most -- the
reaction has been favorable.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.642 align:middle line:84%
I would say about 90
percent of people saying,

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:27.444 align:middle line:90%
love it, you speech to me.

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:30.881 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting letters and e-mails
saying, oh, my gosh, this is me.

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:35.085 align:middle line:84%
And the book itself has stories
-- it has my stories growing up

00:52:35.085 --> 00:52:39.189 align:middle line:84%
and my experiences and also
my clients' experiences.

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:41.725 align:middle line:84%
So you can relate
to something there

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:44.261 align:middle line:84%
so that it will help
you transition.

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:47.731 align:middle line:84%
Also, the book is
being used in groups,

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:50.367 align:middle line:84%
because it has activities
at the end of each chapter

00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:52.936 align:middle line:84%
so people can come in
and create discussion,

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:56.139 align:middle line:84%
and Gaiam would be a great place
for them to do this as well.

00:52:56.139 --> 00:52:58.508 align:middle line:90%
And so the -- I love it.

00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:02.279 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I gave birth
to two sons in this book.

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:03.947 align:middle line:84%
This book right now
is like a toddler.

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:07.617 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to run after it, you
know, to see where it's going

00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:09.119 align:middle line:90%
and it's just wonderful.

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:12.756 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it's connected
to God, the great spirit,

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:14.458 align:middle line:90%
and I know I'm just following

00:53:14.458 --> 00:53:17.060 align:middle line:84%
that energy -- that
energy pathway.

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.662 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And to
this wonderful audience,

00:53:18.662 --> 00:53:20.297 align:middle line:84%
you've brought them
a little present?

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:21.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Absolutely.

00:53:21.798 --> 00:53:25.469 align:middle line:84%
So not only will my two
wonderful volunteers get a book,

00:53:25.469 --> 00:53:27.537 align:middle line:84%
but you all get a
book here today.

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.439 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: How about that?

00:53:29.439 --> 00:53:31.842 align:middle line:90%
[ Applause ]

00:53:31.842 --> 00:53:33.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: And we'd
love your feedback on it,

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:35.045 align:middle line:90%
so e-mail me with your feedback.

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:36.747 align:middle line:84%
I would love, love,
love your feedback.

00:53:36.747 --> 00:53:38.248 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Did
you have fun writing it?

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:40.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: I had a ball
writing it because it was a lot

00:53:40.484 --> 00:53:42.386 align:middle line:90%
of healing that happened.

00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:45.222 align:middle line:84%
I started -- I wrote this book
really about six years ago

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:47.691 align:middle line:84%
and decided to publish
it this year.

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:50.594 align:middle line:84%
I felt like it had to be the
right time, the right place;

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:54.097 align:middle line:84%
not just for the sake of,
well, I'm a published author.

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:56.566 align:middle line:90%
It was really about the timing.

00:53:56.566 --> 00:54:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, the
SBNR lifestyle is really

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.072 align:middle line:90%
prevalent now.

00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:05.208 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of us have heard
somebody say, "I'm spiritual

00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:06.710 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not religious."

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And this will just cut the crap
with a lot of people and say,

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.583 align:middle line:84%
hey, this is what I believe
and this is what I do.

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:16.286 align:middle line:84%
And the book is divided
into four sections.

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:19.489 align:middle line:84%
It's about whether, you know,
you choose the way you want

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:22.659 align:middle line:84%
to connect is Part 1; two, is
whether you're going to come in

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:24.861 align:middle line:84%
or out of this metaphysical
closet

00:54:24.861 --> 00:54:28.231 align:middle line:84%
or really embrace yourself with
it; Three, spiritual tools;

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and four, is spiritual
maintenance

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.802 align:middle line:90%
and finding your tribe.

00:54:31.802 --> 00:54:36.339 align:middle line:84%
So whether you are religious
or not, this book's for you.

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:38.608 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're spiritual or
not, this book's for you.

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:40.343 align:middle line:90%
This book is really for you

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:41.845 align:middle line:84%
because you'll find
something there

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:43.346 align:middle line:90%
that will help your growth.

00:54:43.346 --> 00:54:44.848 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory:

00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:46.349 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend
hypnotherapy to everybody?

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:48.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: I
love hypnotherapy.

00:54:48.318 --> 00:54:49.820 align:middle line:90%
I love. It has helped --

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.922 align:middle line:84%
hypnotherapy, I'm a certified
clinical hypnotherapist.

00:54:51.922 --> 00:54:54.257 align:middle line:84%
I have thousands of
clinical hours in it.

00:54:54.257 --> 00:54:57.227 align:middle line:84%
It's not one of those -- some
people will take a weekend class

00:54:57.227 --> 00:54:59.729 align:middle line:84%
and call them a certified
hypnotherapist, you know.

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:02.599 align:middle line:84%
I've had thousands of hours,
and I've seen magic happen.

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:04.167 align:middle line:90%
I've seen a lot of healing.

00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:05.836 align:middle line:90%
It has helped me with my weight.

00:55:05.836 --> 00:55:07.838 align:middle line:90%
I gave you the earlier example.

00:55:07.838 --> 00:55:12.476 align:middle line:84%
It has helped me with insomnia,
and also with other issues that,

00:55:12.476 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, I've had
issues, so it just cuts --

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.015 align:middle line:84%
it goes deep into your
subconscious mind.

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:21.885 align:middle line:84%
That's where all your memories,
experiences, and beliefs are

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.386 align:middle line:90%
in your subconscious mind.

00:55:23.386 --> 00:55:24.921 align:middle line:90%
It's like your database.

00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:27.023 align:middle line:84%
And even though, you
know, you say I'm going

00:55:27.023 --> 00:55:30.227 align:middle line:84%
to do something different,
whatever, there's that pattern

00:55:30.227 --> 00:55:32.629 align:middle line:84%
in your subconscious mind that
you always take that record

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:37.033 align:middle line:84%
and replay it; however,
what hypnotherapy does is,

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:39.536 align:middle line:84%
I help people get into
their subconscious mind,

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:42.639 align:middle line:84%
deprogram that record,
and put whatever it is

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:44.241 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying to
achieve in your life.

00:55:44.241 --> 00:55:45.775 align:middle line:90%
So it's just a wonderful tool.

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.911 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Can someone do

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:51.314 align:middle line:84%
under hypnotherapy what they
don't want to do in real life?

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:52.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Absolutely not.

00:55:52.816 --> 00:55:54.317 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: You cannot
force somebody to do something?

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:55.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: You cannot.

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:57.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are
four groups of people

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.089 align:middle line:84%
that could never,
ever be hypnotized.

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to know
who they are?

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.092 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Yeah.

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:03.593 align:middle line:90%
Love to.

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:05.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Okay.

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:06.596 align:middle line:84%
So one group would
be if you're drunk.

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:09.266 align:middle line:84%
Group two would be
if you're drugged.

00:56:09.266 --> 00:56:13.603 align:middle line:84%
Group three would be if
your IQ's lower than 70,

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:15.672 align:middle line:84%
and the reason why for
those three groups is

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:17.174 align:middle line:90%
because you can't focus.

00:56:17.174 --> 00:56:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth group
is if you're skeptical.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.012 align:middle line:90%
It won't work.

00:56:22.012 --> 00:56:25.549 align:middle line:84%
So I see that nobody's
drunk or drugged

00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:27.684 align:middle line:84%
and I believe they
have an IQ over 70,

00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:30.153 align:middle line:84%
and I do believe
they believe in it;

00:56:30.153 --> 00:56:32.956 align:middle line:84%
so all of you could
be hypnotizable.

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:35.192 align:middle line:84%
We all hypnotize ourselves
pretty much every day.

00:56:35.192 --> 00:56:36.693 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well,
you didn't look at me

00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:38.195 align:middle line:90%
about the IQ above 70.

00:56:38.195 --> 00:56:40.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: You're
included, George.

00:56:40.463 --> 00:56:41.965 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory:
I've been lucky.

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:43.466 align:middle line:90%
So that's interesting.

00:56:43.466 --> 00:56:45.235 align:middle line:84%
There's some people that
it just won't work for.

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:46.736 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: It won't work.

00:56:46.736 --> 00:56:48.238 align:middle line:84%
Mainly because they're
skeptical.

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:49.739 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.241 align:middle line:90%
>> George Noory: Nonbelievers.

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Nonbelievers.

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:54.244 align:middle line:84%
You can't, you know,
convince anybody.

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:55.745 align:middle line:90%
You're here to enlighten --

00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:57.247 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: Well, you
know, I go back to the case

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:59.783 align:middle line:84%
of Evan Alexander who
was a neurosurgeon

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:02.619 align:middle line:84%
who did not believe
in life after death.

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:06.122 align:middle line:84%
He was a skeptic
until he had one.

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:08.458 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, he wrote
his book and now he's one

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:11.595 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest believers
that there's more to life

00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:13.163 align:middle line:90%
than what people said.

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:14.664 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Right.

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: And maybe
with someone who's an atheist,

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.102 align:middle line:84%
they have to experience
something profound --

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:20.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Absolutely.

00:57:20.604 --> 00:57:22.105 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: -- in order
to have that belief system.

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:23.607 align:middle line:90%
>> Tina Sacchi: Absolutely.

00:57:23.607 --> 00:57:25.108 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, my
husband was one.

00:57:25.108 --> 00:57:26.610 align:middle line:84%
He was not -- that's why
there's different shades

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:28.111 align:middle line:90%
of atheism, you know.

00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:29.613 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't really an atheist.

00:57:29.613 --> 00:57:31.114 align:middle line:84%
He believed in God
but he didn't --

00:57:31.114 --> 00:57:33.850 align:middle line:84%
he was on the fence with
all this that I did.

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:36.019 align:middle line:84%
He was on the fence
with reincarnation.

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:39.422 align:middle line:84%
He was on the fence with
past lives and hypnotherapy.

00:57:39.422 --> 00:57:44.094 align:middle line:84%
He was on the fence until
he had his experience.

00:57:44.094 --> 00:57:48.732 align:middle line:84%
My father-in-law came to visit
-- we were living in Arizona --

00:57:48.732 --> 00:57:51.868 align:middle line:84%
he came to visit right after
9/11, nobody really wanted

00:57:51.868 --> 00:57:53.970 align:middle line:84%
to fly after that,
and especially,

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:57.207 align:middle line:84%
if you live in New York and
want to come to Arizona.

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:59.776 align:middle line:84%
He came to Arizona
to visit us --

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:02.779 align:middle line:84%
and I believe to say
goodbye, because he died.

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:04.881 align:middle line:90%
He died right in my house.

00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:08.551 align:middle line:84%
And my husband was always
on the fence with that.

00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:13.089 align:middle line:84%
And then they whisked
him away to the hospital

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:15.692 align:middle line:90%
and he was pronounced dead.

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:19.095 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden,
my husband comes home

00:58:19.095 --> 00:58:24.334 align:middle line:84%
and he's telling me this story
that when he was going out,

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:27.837 align:middle line:84%
because he needed a break from
all this chaos that happened

00:58:27.837 --> 00:58:30.607 align:middle line:84%
that day, he went
to go get a pizza.

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:35.979 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as he got in his
car, his father showed up,

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:38.481 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking
with his father.

00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:42.319 align:middle line:84%
And he said this light
came on his dashboard,

00:58:42.319 --> 00:58:44.387 align:middle line:84%
his father's sitting
in the front seat.

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:45.889 align:middle line:90%
It blew him away.

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Now, my --

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:48.892 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory: That
makes you believe --

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:50.393 align:middle line:84%
>> Tina Sacchi: -- my husband
was on the fence with all this.

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:51.895 align:middle line:90%
Remember that point?

00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:56.733 align:middle line:84%
So he goes, drives to the
pizzeria, and he's like all

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:59.703 align:middle line:84%
like now out of sorts, and he's
his dad, "don't go anywhere.
