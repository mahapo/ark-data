>>GEORGE NOORY: What
you're about to see

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
on Beyond Belief may frighten
you, it may shock you,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.210 align:middle line:10%
but I'm telling you,
it is truly authentic.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Todd Standing is with us, a
researcher and filmmaker who,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:84%
after a life changing Sasquatch
encounter 20 plus years ago,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:84%
dedicated himself to
proving their existence.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:84%
He gathers evidence, studies
their family structure

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and abilities, and advocates
for their recognition,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:84%
believing that they hold
the keys to human evolution.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Todd, you do great work.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.675 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Beyond Belief.

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TODD STANDING:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Todd, how did
this happen for you?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:10%
>>STANDING: Well, I
started out as a skeptic

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:10%
and I started with
a scientific paper

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:10%
at a university I was studying
at to disprove the species

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:10%
existence.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So it was called a hoax,
mistaken identity theory.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:10%
And my whole point
of it was to show

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:10%
there was no ecological
niche for a primate species

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.155 align:middle line:10%
to survive all
through North America,

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:10%
into the Pacific Northwest.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
an easy equation.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.903 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I started
working with what

00:01:16.903 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I considered to be some
of the best wilderness

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:84%
experts in the world, which
are Native Americans and First

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Nations people.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Best trackers, bar none.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: And they know
this species is real.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:90%
They're not believers.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'd start seeing
tracking information,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's still, as skeptical
as I could try to be--

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
it changed for me when a
wildlife biologist from Great

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Falls, Montana, took
me out on an expedition

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to film two
pieces of Sasquatch video,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and it obviously wasn't the
film so much as the experiences

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and what I was
witnessing in that time

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.720 align:middle line:90%
period, that just blew my mind.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:84%
It was such a paradigm
shift in my life

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.810 align:middle line:84%
that it's affected
me so profoundly

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that this incredible
bipedal manlike

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.455 align:middle line:84%
species exists, that I've been
just dedicated to it ever since.

00:01:58.455 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good for you.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.962 align:middle line:84%
Some of the video we're going
to look at later in the program

00:02:01.962 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:90%
is astounding.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.217 align:middle line:84%
How do you compare it to
the Patterson-Gimlin film.

00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: I don't.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Patterson-Gimlin
film is a classic,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:84%
incredible piece of information,
and I could literally do a whole

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:84%
documentary about the
Patterson-Gimlin film like

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
you've never seen,
because that Sasquatch--

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'll talk about that for
the first time ever right here--

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:84%
that Sasquatch was
waiting for Patterson,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and she walked that walk to
show humanity that they exist.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And I can actually prove
that through multiple pieces

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.650 align:middle line:84%
of evidence that
Patterson left behind

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and what that Sasquatch
particularly did.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So from my perspective,
way beyond the evidence,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
the gaits, the bipedalism, the
mannerism in which she walks--

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that footage--

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:84%
it's scary to me
how people can be

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
so dissident to
something that is

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:90%
such incredibly obvious proof.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
It's Jeff Meldrum talks about it
and he's got his whole analysis

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.590 align:middle line:84%
from Grover Krantz and all
these great people, that

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
have proven that footage is
absolutely, totally authentic.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And my footage-- well,
what's different about me

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
is Patterson had his
shot and that was it.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:90%
With me, it's repeatability.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I have these videos
and many of them--

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.933 align:middle line:90%
none of them have the track--

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:10.350 align:middle line:84%
like the combination of what
the Patterson footage brought

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:90%
together is brilliant.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:84%
What I have is different videos
showing size, showing speed

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that a man can't do, showing a
nine foot six tall individual

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:84%
walking anatomically moving
faster than the fastest man.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So all these different things
with facials and whatnot

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
that I have, but it's
a body of evidence.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And for the first
time ever, not only I

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
have this evidence with
the DNA, with the footage,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.157 align:middle line:84%
but I take people out
and show them Sasquatch.

00:03:34.157 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Patterson couldn't do.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I do
and what sets me apart,

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.490 align:middle line:90%
is the evidence will never stop.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm at video nine,
video 10 and growing.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:84%
It'll never stop coming and I'll
never stop taking out people.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:84%
The best in the world
have come out with me.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Jeff Meldrum, speaking
of him, that man

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
saw Sasquatch in my documentary
after three days with me.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
After a half a lifetime
of searching for them,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:84%
in three days he saw a
Sasquatch, and that's

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.982 align:middle line:84%
happened 29 times, where people
go, I've seen your videos.

00:04:01.982 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:90%
I've seen your footage.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, there's a Sasquatch.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's growing every year.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm out in the
field over 100 days

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:84%
guiding people, doing my own
expeditions, gathering evidence.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally, it's
a de facto discovery

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:90%
from my perspective.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
else can I do, George.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:90%
I've taken out Survivorman.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I've taken out doctors,
lawyers, judges, PhDs.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:90%
All these great men and women.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Wildlife officers will testify.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're all witnesses.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: They've
all seen a Sasquatch.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:84%
What man or woman do I have to
take out, show them a Sasquatch

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:84%
before people will start
understanding that this

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:90%
is legit, this is real?

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.065 align:middle line:90%
The discovery is happening.

00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:37.137 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were at the
University of Alberta.

00:04:37.137 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Correct.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.345 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: At what point did
you see your first Sasquatch?

00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Well, that was when
I went to Great Falls, Montana,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
under the guidance
of that biologist.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And I shot what I
call video 2 and 3.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:90%
So I have multiple videos.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And each video--
each video segment--

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.598 align:middle line:84%
I consider there's
a video 5 where

00:04:52.598 --> 00:04:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I've got like six different
photographs and three

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.870 align:middle line:84%
different angles I got
video of a Sasquatch.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So each incident is
video 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say,
I'm up to video 9

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and I've produced
nearly 30 Sasquatch

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
videos, 50 photographs in
those nine sequences of videos.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first one that really,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
again, made me
become so passionate.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And the learning
[LAUGHS] when I look

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
back at who I was
compared to who I am now.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Gaia is such a
good fit for me because you guys

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:84%
are about the spiritual inner
workings and things like

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.870 align:middle line:84%
telepathy that are sort of--
they're really scientific now--

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we want the
truth and you bring it-- you

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:90%
bring us the truth.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: I mean,
what do I have to do?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
What does Gaia have to do
before people understand

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're really speaking about
we're the evolution of mankind?

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Sasquatch, this is the key.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:90%
They're telepathic.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.170 align:middle line:84%
How do you sneak up on something
that can feel you coming,

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:90%
that knows your intent?

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And we know, those
of us who are in the

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.045 align:middle line:84%
know, telepathy
is legit and real.

00:05:50.045 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk around naked
and you eat a perfectly balanced

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:84%
nutritional diet and you're
connected to the earth,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and you understand
all these life force

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:84%
energies and the trees and the
mushrooms and the sphagnum moss,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
you're highly telepathic,
it allows you an ability

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to be quantum in a way that
I've never actually seen

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:90%
a human being be capable of.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
This species literally thrives
being telepathic, being quantum,

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and seeing things in a
deeper, meaningful way.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.392 align:middle line:84%
And that's precisely
what Gaia is all about.

00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why you guys
are successful,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I'm here.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Tell us about the DNA.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:90%
What does it tell you?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: It was so
incredible because--

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:33.270 align:middle line:84%
so if I do a little scale, so
the DNA goes orangutan, gorilla,

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.630 align:middle line:90%
chimpanzee and human, right?

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So everybody thought that
this chimpanzee human,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:90%
it would be here.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:90%
And they're not.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:90%
They're over here.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So literally as a
hominid is, their DNA

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:90%
shows a more advanced hominid.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
They are further away from
the great apes than we are.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.377 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the DNA
is what people say,

00:06:52.377 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:84%
we're just something between
chimpanzee and human.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's what Todd's doing.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
He's mixing up in a crock
pot in his basement DNA.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, no, you can't
mix advanced hominid DNA.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And the more I learn
about this species--

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.880 align:middle line:84%
so I've worked with Les
Stroud, survivorman,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:84%
toughest, legitimate,
amazing dude

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that there is when it comes to
wilderness filming and outdoors.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
That human being, if I put
him out in the wilderness,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.440 align:middle line:84%
I said, no technology, no
survival skills, naked, survive.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Probably wouldn't make
it in three months.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.585 align:middle line:84%
If I did that with
the Sasquatch,

00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:22.585 align:middle line:84%
I could come back in three
years and he'd be fat

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:90%
and he'd have his feet up.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Who's a more advanced hominid?

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think you
have your answer.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And it shows that
in the DNA, which

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.570 align:middle line:90%
should blow people's minds.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.192 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to be the most
advanced hominid, but we're not.

00:07:35.192 --> 00:07:35.992 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:07:35.992 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Didn't Melba
Ketchum have some DNA, too?

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Well, it
wasn't Melba Ketchum at all

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:90%
that interested me.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:90%
She was just a hired gun.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:84%
It was what Adrian Erickson
did who paid for it.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
nobody asked this question.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:90%
Where did the DNA come from?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't want
to talk about that.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to be a lab
tech and to analyze something

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:90%
that you're paid to do.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Where did
that DNA come from?

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I wanted to know.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And Adrian Erickson, the one
that put it all together,

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the man who deserves all
the credit for the DNA

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and paid for all
those studies, he

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.160 align:middle line:84%
found a man, Randy
Brisson, and that's

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:84%
who I went after,
because that's what I am.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm boots on the ground.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:90%
I want to know--

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the DNA is
legit, but who got it?

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:90%
And nobody ever asked that.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And I did, and I've
worked with Randy Brisson,

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and he's an incredible boots on
the ground amazing researcher

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.050 align:middle line:90%
that gets no credit.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.005 align:middle line:90%
And he got the DNA, right?

00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:27.675 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you find the
Sasquatch to be male female?

00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:28.475 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Both incredibly
masculine, amazingly feminine.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:90%
I see both.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I have a female
colleague researcher

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:84%
that I work with that
has more interactions

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:40.573 align:middle line:90%
with the feminine side.

00:08:40.573 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
particular Sasquatch

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.130 align:middle line:84%
that I filmed who's a
female, who I call Jane.

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:84%
She gets incredible
interactions with her.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're really working
towards having that.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, I
need a female researcher

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:84%
because the greatest
primatologist of all time not

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:84%
arguably, are Jane Goodall,
Dian Fossey and Birutė Galdikas.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:90%
All women.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So I worked very
hard over the years

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:84%
to get a female involved
in this discovery process.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And now she goes
out as a feminine

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and gets this incredible
interactions with them

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:90%
in a very specific way.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And I go out as a masculine
and I do it very differently,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and I get different
individuals that

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:84%
appreciate me and come around
me more as same as she does.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, everybody
I take out, there's

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:84%
a Sasquatch that has a chemistry
with a particular person,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and they'll come and they'll
interact with that person

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.935 align:middle line:90%
and separate myself from them.

00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
makes my research different,

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:90%
too, is they're my teachers.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't have anything
to offer them.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I go out there hubris and
humble and ask them to guide me.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I literally know that-- so I can
only take out 30 people a year

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:90%
on expedition.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them are repeats
that want to come back.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I have hundreds of
people that want to go.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the Sasquatch that
guide me to these people.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.590 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody wants
to see a Sasquatch

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and the Sasquatch
sees them as a light

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and telepathically wants to meet
them, they use me as a conduit.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's my job as a good
student of the Sasquatch,

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
who are my teachers, who are up
levels above me when it comes

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
to spirituality, telepathy,
and even wilderness knowledge

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and understanding, as a
superior teacher, they guide me.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm so
successful at what I do,

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:90%
because I don't really--

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I can't take somebody out and
force a Sasquatch to see them.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.940 align:middle line:90%
These people have to attract it.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And the Gaia network understands
that better than anybody.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.090 align:middle line:84%
The law of attraction,
the reality

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.790 align:middle line:84%
of the power of telepathy,
mind speak, remote viewing.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:84%
The Sasquatch have been doing
that for thousands of years.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:90%
I can prove that.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.415 align:middle line:84%
So we're just in our
infancy studying.

00:10:29.415 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Their first sensory perception
is through telepathy.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Has there
ever been any reports

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:90%
of human Sasquatch hybrids?

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Yes, and
that's in the DNA.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's just a simple fact, is
nine times in the-- there's nine

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:90%
female mitochondria's--

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.955 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who made it with who?

00:10:49.955 --> 00:10:51.788 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: That's
through the Melba Ketchum

00:10:51.788 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and other substantiative
DNA studies.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And I can actually see that,
too, where nine times--

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
a half man half-- or half
human, half Sasquatch female

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:84%
only has bred back
in the population.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And that truth in the
beginning, well, people

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:90%
are saying, why only females?

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm seeing a
male-dominated society,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
a male who was half human and
half Sasquatch would be weaker

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and wouldn't be able to compete
and produce viable offspring,

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:84%
whereas a female is always
going to automatically get

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.280 align:middle line:90%
a male to breed with her.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way it works
in male-dominated societies

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:90%
where males are competing.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.655 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What kind of male would
have mated with a Sasquatch?

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: One that was a male.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: A human?

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Well, just again,
theoretically, a male Sasquatch

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:90%
would breed with a human female.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm seeing
in the First Nations legends

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.932 align:middle line:84%
as well as, female, human
females were abducted.

00:11:42.932 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
offspring look like?

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.682 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: I don't know.

00:11:45.682 --> 00:11:48.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's happened
a long time ago.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So those are very deep
questions that I just

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:90%
don't have the answers to yet.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How many Sasquatch
groups are out there, Todd?

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:55.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: A lot.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in my documentary,
Discovering Bigfoot,

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.475 align:middle line:84%
when I talk about
it, I say 15,000.

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I really use that
number, though,

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
based on the amount of people
that were in this particular

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
region I was doing this study,
just to show percentages,

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
where there's 15 million people
live in 20% of the territory,

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:84%
15,000 of them, which is
a fraction live in 80%

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:90%
of the territory.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.258 align:middle line:84%
And that's just in
the Pacific Northwest.

00:12:19.258 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think those
numbers are probably

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.640 align:middle line:84%
pretty decent because
the more I go out--

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I literally most of
the time when I go out,

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I can see signs that
Sasquatch are leaving

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and I can interact with
them in particular areas.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think there is a
significant abundance of them,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.145 align:middle line:84%
If you want to say
15,000 is abundant.

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, and are
they Indigenous primarily

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.776 align:middle line:90%
to North America?

00:12:39.776 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: They are so
well-adapted to survive

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.880 align:middle line:84%
in North America, it's
like a white tailed deer

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:90%
or a black bear.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:84%
They are incredibly symbiotic,
Indigenous like human beings

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:90%
have never been.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
In all our history,
humans always

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:84%
used technology,
TPS, bows and arrows,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:90%
even picking up a club, right?

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:90%
We all have that.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle line:84%
They never did that
and they don't need to.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:84%
When you're nine feet
tall, over 900 pounds,

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:84%
you can fight hand to
hand with a grizzly bear

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and win, especially
when you're intellectual

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.388 align:middle line:90%
and you're intelligent about it.

00:13:11.388 --> 00:13:12.680 align:middle line:90%
And there's so many advantages.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.885 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They get that tall?

00:13:13.885 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Oh, yeah.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:90%
They're so big, so enormous.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you actually think
about it, a nine foot four--

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:84%
my dominant male
that's in my area that

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:84%
allows me to go and
do the research there,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:84%
he's nine foot four
and that's only--

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.687 align:middle line:84%
with my shoes on,
I'm six foot five,

00:13:30.687 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:84%
so let's say approximately
just around three feet taller

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:90%
than me.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:90%
That's only a third bigger.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But I'm 220 pounds
and he's 950 pounds.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.445 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: So that's where you
get, OK, he's three feet tall--

00:13:42.445 --> 00:13:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sign him up
for a football team.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Right?

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing-- a 10-year-old
Sasquatch would annihilate

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the best NFL players
in the world.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Look, you're talking
twice the size

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of a gorilla, more
than twice the power

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:84%
because they're
cold-weather primates.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Gorillas have looser fibers.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.260 align:middle line:84%
When you get colder, like
a bear that's 400 pounds,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.515 align:middle line:84%
has significantly better power
and speed than a gorilla.

00:14:06.515 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:84%
But you take that and you
apply that cold-weather primate

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle line:90%
like we've never seen.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.912 align:middle line:84%
All the primates we know of are
all tropical or subtropical.

00:14:12.912 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So you have a cold-weather
primate that's

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:90%
got denser muscle tissue.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:84%
It's what I've
seen and what I've

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
measured in the ecology
with their power,

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.380 align:middle line:90%
is nothing short of terrifying.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Todd, aside
from the obvious,

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.255 align:middle line:84%
what's the difference between
a male or a female Sasquatch?

00:14:27.255 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: The
sexual dimorphism

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
between males and females,
it's really significant.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Like the Patterson footage,
which is absolutely real,

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:90%
that female--

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I have her maybe 400
pounds, 500 pounds,

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:90%
she's only about six foot four.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So you're literally
talking, again,

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
they're a third taller
and then weight double.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's significant
sexual dimorphism.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And what that shows us is
when birds are the same size

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:84%
or animals are the
same size, there's

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:90%
less competition between males.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:84%
The more a gorilla is
bigger than female gorillas,

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:84%
the more competition
between males there is.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:84%
So in the biology, we can assume
that males compete for females.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.233 align:middle line:84%
They're much bigger,
much stronger.

00:15:08.233 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And so now you're going to
have a very masculine-dominated

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:84%
society that has no respect
for weakness, which they don't.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Our weak people are
all over the place.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
born, you survive.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.307 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter how
strong you are.

00:15:19.307 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:90%
They don't have those things.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And although they're the most
man-like species to the point

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:84%
where they can interbreed with
us and produce viable offspring,

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.375 align:middle line:84%
they are literally in every
other way, the opposite of us.

00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that I teach

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.375 align:middle line:84%
my expeditioners it's hard for
people to wrap their head around

00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
is they're the most,
but they're the apps--

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
we're technological
and domesticated,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.985 align:middle line:90%
they're wild and free.

00:15:39.985 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
should really get

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:90%
people, especially in America.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing
with a free being.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:90%
We're not free.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Your shoes domesticate you,
your clothes domesticate you.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.450 align:middle line:84%
They literally wake up
in the morning naked

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and walk right out of their rock
that they slept under their tree

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.227 align:middle line:90%
and go thrive.

00:15:55.227 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:84%
They're beholden to
no one and they're

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
free to do whatever they
want, whenever they want.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And they don't have
to go to work every day.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: They do.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.753 align:middle line:84%
They go survive, and they
thrive in these environments,

00:16:04.753 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and they have
tremendous abundance

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:90%
and really good success there.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.530 align:middle line:84%
They're the apex species
in their environment,

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:84%
no different than we're apex
when it comes to technology.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But you versus them
and you will lose.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:84%
That's how we have to have
respect for the miracle that is

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:90%
nature and our natural selves.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
Sasquatch teach us,

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.130 align:middle line:84%
is how powerful
we are in nature.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And what scares me and the
message I'm trying to teach

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.320 align:middle line:84%
is stop domesticating, stop
being so technologically

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:90%
advanced.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.795 align:middle line:84%
You got to get back to nature
because that's where we thrive.

00:16:35.795 --> 00:16:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The group
that you study,

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.375 align:middle line:90%
how did you connect with them?

00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: They called to me.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:90%
They attracted me out there.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I had dreams and I
was drawn to a place.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And then what really capped
it, though, is there's

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:90%
kind of two areas.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a Nordic-- so I did
Survivorman Bigfoot in Nordic

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and Radium, and it was always
kind of a battle back and forth.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
They were both trying to
attract me in various ways,

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
but at the end of the day, I
was so well received in Radium.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.300 align:middle line:90%
They interact with me.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So well and it's
chemistry, right?

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I have good, really
solid, amazing chemistry.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:84%
Although I missed the
Sasquatch in Montana

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.377 align:middle line:84%
and I missed the Sasquatch
in Alberta, the BC Sasquatch.

00:17:11.377 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You'll get there.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Yeah.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
And that's the expansion of
what I do, new research sites,

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.535 align:middle line:84%
new people involved that are
doing research like I am,

00:17:20.535 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and expanding the
knowledge and understanding

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
of this incredibly,
massively important study.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:84%
Sasquatch, the
discovery of Sasquatch

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
will blow up your
network, will explode it.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Even quantum physicists that
I talked to and work to.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
They're like, Sasquatch are
doing these quantum things

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and manipulating
frequency, seeing

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:84%
beyond into the earth where
there's abundance and flowers

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and communicating
with the mushrooms

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.400 align:middle line:84%
as they communicate
to themselves.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.080 align:middle line:84%
We're all capable
of these things.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.835 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the Gaia
network is so much about.

00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:51.315 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Tell me about
Seager and its role.

00:17:51.315 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: So he is the
dominant male in that area.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And he allows for all the
success that I garner.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.060 align:middle line:90%
He's the tribal leader.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to the conclusion,
for me, anthropologically, I

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:84%
find the best comparisons
between gorillas

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.135 align:middle line:84%
and human beings when I apply
it in nature to Sasquatch.

00:18:11.135 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And originally I applied--
there was a dominant male like

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.503 align:middle line:84%
gorillas, and that dominant
male had a harem of females,

00:18:16.503 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:90%
and I actually don't--

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's
not true anymore.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:84%
I have evidence to show that
there's a tribal leader, more

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
like the First Nations, the
Native American people--

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.370 align:middle line:84%
a tribal leader, and he has
a monogamous relationship

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:90%
with his female.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But he rules over the
tribe, even the elders.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:90%
And he makes all the decisions.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.920 align:middle line:84%
His daughters and his sons
and his family come around me,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and he's the one that
allows for it all.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And when he gets involved,
it's really special

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:84%
because he's such a
powerful entity that it

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:90%
takes really powerful even.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:84%
He's attracted and
drawn to strong men.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful experience
when I get him to come around.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.230 align:middle line:90%
But he's always watching.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.630 align:middle line:84%
They're making sure
everything's OK

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:84%
because he's the guardian
and as a masculine,

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:90%
he's extremely protective.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that he's allowed
his daughter and his sons,

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
even the young ones,
to come around me,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.250 align:middle line:90%
especially when I'm alone--

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.685 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It seems like there's
some intelligence there.

00:19:10.685 --> 00:19:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: It's
incredible intelligence.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.310 align:middle line:84%
They literally have a working
intelligence, a spirituality

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:22.093 align:middle line:84%
and a morality to me, that
is so on par with nature.

00:19:22.093 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
They are literally--
like, we've learned

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.070 align:middle line:84%
chimpanzees, as an example,
have something called

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.915 align:middle line:84%
working intelligence
where they're much

00:19:27.915 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:90%
smarter than a human being.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
If you show them a
screen and they'll

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.480 align:middle line:84%
identify 40 images, where a
genius human can maybe get 13.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:90%
I've tried the test.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: And I've
seen the Sasquatch do

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:84%
this in examples of-- it's
almost haunting the way they'll

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
look at the ground, and
then they'll look at you

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.690 align:middle line:84%
and they'll run for 50
yards moving through trees.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:84%
They've memorized the ecology
and they can look at you now,

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.270 align:middle line:90%
and it's haunting to see that.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.365 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can do that.

00:19:52.365 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can memorize
all of that.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.157 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to tell you a
Sasquatch story in a minute,

00:19:56.157 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
but let's take a look at some
tape of some other members

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:84%
of the Sasquatch family,
and you can tell us

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:90%
what we're looking at.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: So this is Kabota.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:90%
He's an elder.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:10%
And the evidence to substantiate
this footage is real

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:10%
is absolutely incredible,
because the eye spacing

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:10%
is non-human.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at this,
if it's non-human eye spacing

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
and you clearly can
see nasal moving--

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: There's his face.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Yeah.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's clearly the
blinking eyes, the wet eyes.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He looks human.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: It does.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But the spacing between
the eyes are not human.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you saw that in real
life, you'd realize the head

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:90%
is 15 inches across.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:10%
This is Jake.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:10%
So a Sasquatch I had incredible
live interactions with.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
He was actually
a friend of mine.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I considered him a
good teacher of mine.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.080 align:middle line:84%
You can see him blinking,
and he's gone now.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen him
in many years, which

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:90%
has been very upsetting to me.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.675 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You think he died.

00:20:49.675 --> 00:20:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: No, I think he
was a dominant young male,

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:90%
and he's gone off.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:90%
There he is.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:90%
This is another video of Jake.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.733 align:middle line:84%
He's just gone off to
somewhere far away.

00:20:56.733 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This is
incredible video, Todd.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:90%
This is absolutely stunning.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: And don't
take my word for it.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Come out with me.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:03.408 align:middle line:90%
And I show people this.

00:21:03.408 --> 00:21:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's this?

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.612 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: This is Jake again.

00:21:05.612 --> 00:21:06.770 align:middle line:90%
This is just--

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I focused on the
eye blink there.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So I turned up the
exposure-- and all my stuff

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:90%
is documentary style.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So I can turn up saturation
like I do in this one.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Saturation gets turned up,
but just so you can clearly

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
see that individual.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And again, eye
spacing is non-human.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:90%
And I proved that head--

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, my head is
seven inches across.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.630 align:middle line:90%
That head is like 16 across.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:84%
My head fits just over
the passage of his nose.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.550 align:middle line:90%
This is a female.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.540 align:middle line:90%
I call her Jane.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:10%
That's the daughter of Seager.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:10%
And my colleague, Ashley, has
incredible success with her.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing to me.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
My Native teacher-- so I
initially thought this was just

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:84%
a male Sasquatch--
my Native teacher--

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:84%
here she is from a
different angle--

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.103 align:middle line:84%
Looked at that and said,
wow, you filmed a female.

00:21:50.103 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Years later, I saw breasts on
her, and I've seen her around

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and I gauge what
female Sasquatch

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:84%
do based on her
tracks, which are

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.710 align:middle line:84%
the same size as the
Patterson footage

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and her interactions and
the way she shows herself.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.050 align:middle line:90%
She'll walk around a puddle.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:90%
A male will blast through it.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:84%
She'll make gentle, beautiful
tree breaks that are precise,

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and a male is rugged
and harsh and wants

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:90%
a big giant egotistical.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why don't
they run away from you?

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Right here
she's looking down at me.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
She's the last line
of defense for me

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.793 align:middle line:84%
going into a position where I
was going to get more footage.

00:22:23.793 --> 00:22:25.585 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why did they
let you get so close?

00:22:25.585 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Ah, she didn't.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.063 align:middle line:84%
I was moving in a
ghillie suit and I'd

00:22:28.063 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:90%
come-- see the snow there?

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Literally, I came in.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I had success because
there was snowstorm so

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:84%
bad you couldn't see your
hand in front of your face.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.898 align:middle line:90%
So I got into the snowstorm.

00:22:36.898 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:84%
After the snowstorm--
this is the day

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.470 align:middle line:84%
after, they came back
down the mountain.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where
is this located?

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: This is close
to Radium, British Columbia.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.160 align:middle line:90%
And all this is Jane.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So you can see
everywhere there's snow.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And now what's happening
too it's gone up way above--

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:90%
It was in the fall.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So we had a minus 10
day with a snowstorm.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Next day it's like plus 15.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So all the snow is
melting like crazy,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
which creates sound and makes
me better to be stealthy.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:84%
But she's looking,
she's closing in on me.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And when she finally
nails it that that's Todd.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:12.980 align:middle line:90%
He's there.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.655 align:middle line:84%
Literally, a Sasquatch walks up
behind me, grabs me by the ankle

00:23:16.655 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and pulls me out of
my ghillie clothes.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's some of
the most unbelievable video

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.080 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.705 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: That's
never going to stop.

00:23:22.705 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And again, I've taken out
people and showed them that.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Survivorman has
been out with me.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:84%
He filmed the top of
the head of a Sasquatch,

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
which matches Jake's head,
and he's been out there

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and he's Survivorman, again,
one of the greatest outdoor--

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.370 align:middle line:84%
no, the greatest outdoor
survivalist filmmaker

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:90%
of all time.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.855 align:middle line:84%
And he literally goes,
I have no explanation

00:23:41.855 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:84%
for what's out there
in the wilderness.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.627 align:middle line:90%
I know all animals.

00:23:44.627 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I know what moose
and bird sound like.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:10%
And something took my
apples, left giant footprints

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:10%
on the ground,
got footage of it.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.920 align:middle line:10%
And the truth is, behind the
scenes, he knows they're real.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:90%
He's trying to be skeptical.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.025 align:middle line:84%
So he's siding with the
majority of people that believe

00:23:59.025 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:90%
that Sasquatch aren't real.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:01.447 align:middle line:90%
He's trying to draw them over.

00:24:01.447 --> 00:24:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you have
a lot of doubters

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:90%
when they see the films?

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Absolutely.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's preposterous the
infinite amount of garbage

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:90%
that gets thrown at me.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But I've learned
from my mentors,

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.328 align:middle line:84%
especially my Native mentors,
when someone can see the truth,

00:24:14.328 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:84%
they look at that
footage-- like I've

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.340 align:middle line:84%
seen Native elders look at it
and go, oh, that's a Bigfoot.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.715 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be like,
how they know?

00:24:19.715 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Because when someone is
true and they're flowing

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and they have good energy,
they can look at things,

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.185 align:middle line:84%
they can at the
Patterson footage

00:24:26.185 --> 00:24:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
need any evidence.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:90%
They can know it's real.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.790 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't like that.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:90%
I am now.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I can look at something, I
can feel the energy of it

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:90%
and the truth comes out for me.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what I'm
here and why I'm exposing this,

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:84%
because they are real
and that's the truth.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.788 align:middle line:90%
And I will prove it.

00:24:42.788 --> 00:24:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I will prove it with
the hardline skeptics.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.500 align:middle line:84%
My first order of business
was always fish and wildlife

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:84%
through the petition and
through my court cases

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.327 align:middle line:84%
that I fought for in California
and British Columbia.

00:24:54.327 --> 00:24:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I wanted fish and
wildlife to come out

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:84%
with me because I will damn
well show them a Sasquatch.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:84%
That was what I did
in the very beginning,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
in 2006, when I
knew they were real.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I walked into fish and
wildlife in Montana,

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.550 align:middle line:84%
in Idaho and Alberta
and British Columbia.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I walked into their
office and said,

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:84%
forget about the
news and the media.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.343 align:middle line:84%
Who's got the
intestinal fortitude

00:25:10.343 --> 00:25:12.510 align:middle line:84%
to come out with me and I
will show you a Sasquatch?

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've been doing
that from the beginning.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.427 align:middle line:84%
And that's the next level
of a discovery process,

00:25:17.427 --> 00:25:19.260 align:middle line:84%
is when they have, I'm
just going to say it,

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:84%
the balls to come out
and say, prove it to me.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.647 align:middle line:84%
Show me a Sasquatch and I
will win every single time.

00:25:24.647 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going
to tell you a story

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and you tell me if
you think it's true.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: OK.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: A guy calls
my radio show--

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Yes.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he said he's
fishing on the side of a lake.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Yes.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.525 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he
catches two trout.

00:25:36.525 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Yes.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:41.425 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He turns around
and behind him, he says,

00:25:41.425 --> 00:25:42.225 align:middle line:90%
the Sasquatch.

00:25:42.225 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Yeah.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He said he scared the
living daylights out of him.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said Sasquatch
walked up to him

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.940 align:middle line:90%
and looked at the two fish.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Mm-hmm.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.085 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He panicked and handed
the two fish to the Sasquatch.

00:25:56.085 --> 00:25:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Yes.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Sasquatch took
the two fish, looked at him

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:02.502 align:middle line:90%
and gave him one back.

00:26:02.502 --> 00:26:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Absolutely.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you believe that?

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Yes.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:90%
They do that all the time.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I can put up 10 apples, and
if I have three expeditioners,

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
seven will get taken
and three will get left.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.588 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That tells me
there's an intelligence there.

00:26:13.588 --> 00:26:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Well, even beyond--

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: An emotion.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Yeah.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:84%
What animal is going to do
anything other than devour them?

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Like the ability to
cooperate, to be cognizant.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.163 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee you,
if I talk to that man,

00:26:24.163 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't ask him
about the fish.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, tell me
about the wilderness.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about the
sounds that you hear,

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.217 align:middle line:84%
how much you appreciate
nature, and I'll

00:26:30.217 --> 00:26:32.470 align:middle line:84%
find a man if he's telling
the truth that's beautiful

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and loving of nature,
and I'll show him

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.070 align:middle line:84%
that Sasquatch has been
watching him for a long time.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
That incident transpired
after years of the Sasquatch

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.070 align:middle line:84%
learning about him and
studying him and knowing

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.040 align:middle line:90%
that he's a good man.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I interview
somebody, at the end of it,

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:84%
when I know they're
telling the truth,

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.718 align:middle line:84%
because they are
good people, I'll

00:26:47.718 --> 00:26:49.010 align:middle line:90%
say something that nobody says.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I say, congratulations, you
manifested a Sasquatch encounter

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.515 align:middle line:84%
because you were so beautiful
and so connected to nature.

00:26:55.515 --> 00:26:56.557 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That is amazing.

00:26:56.557 --> 00:26:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: And I feel that.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.350 align:middle line:84%
That's where I can really
connect with these people,

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.310 align:middle line:84%
is going deeper and seeing
that they love nature

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and how the Sasquatch finds
them kindred, and then

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.700 align:middle line:84%
even that exchange--
and it's not just

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.560 align:middle line:84%
the Sasquatch getting that trout
and the man getting the trout.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It's that all-- that
permission and that cooperation

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:84%
and that next step
into not being afraid.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I would tell that man,
get back out there.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if he's scared off
and he's not going back,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.025 align:middle line:84%
it's defeated the
purpose of the incident.

00:27:28.025 --> 00:27:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Right?

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Get back out there.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:84%
There's something really
beautiful about you.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.257 align:middle line:90%
Get back to nature.

00:27:33.257 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
That's going to keep
happening to you.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
People that have
that success truly

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.580 align:middle line:84%
will continue to have
that because they

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.560 align:middle line:84%
have that beautiful
love of nature

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and that beautiful
light inside them

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:44.170 align:middle line:84%
that the Sasquatch
can recognize,

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and they'll garner
continuous success,

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.400 align:middle line:84%
or they get so scared
they never go back.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, the Sasquatch
is very disappointed in that.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:90%
That's not what they intended.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.467 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You brought us a
clip of a Sasquatch moving

00:27:54.467 --> 00:27:56.438 align:middle line:84%
with incredible speed
through the environment.

00:27:56.438 --> 00:27:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Faster than
the fastest man can move.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.635 align:middle line:10%
>>MAN: By the trees.

00:28:00.635 --> 00:28:01.662 align:middle line:10%
[PANTING]

00:28:01.662 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:10%
>>STANDING: I got it.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.256 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.256 --> 00:28:07.056 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:28:07.056 --> 00:28:10.704 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.704 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:10%
This is absolutely raw
footage with my audio in it.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:23.642 align:middle line:10%
And it stabilized, to be
put into 1080p by Amanda.

00:28:23.642 --> 00:28:25.350 align:middle line:10%
Now we're going to do
this with no audio.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.550 align:middle line:10%
So here's the Sasquatch.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:10%
Look how fast he's moving there.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.670 align:middle line:10%
She's going to slow it
down in the next segment.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.110 align:middle line:10%
But did you see that leg speed?

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.620 align:middle line:10%
That is incredible for a
seven foot four individual.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.980 align:middle line:10%
Smokes through the Bush there.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.630 align:middle line:10%
Now, do you see that
little something there?

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.422 align:middle line:10%
We're going to go back
to that in a second.

00:28:38.422 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:10%
Flies up that hill and
then-- see him slow down?

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.300 align:middle line:10%
Stutter step.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:42.740 align:middle line:10%
Boom!

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.560 align:middle line:10%
Right into a wall.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.270 align:middle line:10%
Now watch really closely
as she's traced it.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:10%
Look at this.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.748 align:middle line:10%
This is slowed down.

00:28:46.748 --> 00:28:48.540 align:middle line:10%
Look at that speed and
look really closely.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:10%
He slips and almost
goes down there.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:56.610 align:middle line:10%
And then he's back up on his
feet almost perfectly, fluidly,

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.080 align:middle line:10%
right back up into the trees.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.820 align:middle line:10%
And now he can't
get breaking speed.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.780 align:middle line:10%
He's got to slow down.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.820 align:middle line:10%
Seems slow down in
the stutter step

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.210 align:middle line:10%
because he just hit
a wall of trees.

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:10%
Look at this tracing
that Amanda did where

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:10%
you can see the body parts.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.440 align:middle line:10%
Now here's the slip.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.420 align:middle line:10%
Look at him go down and slip.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.740 align:middle line:10%
See the trees moving?

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.810 align:middle line:10%
That's a slippage because
he's blasting through there

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.190 align:middle line:10%
so quickly, right back up.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.660 align:middle line:10%
Almost seamlessly,
like a quadruped.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.310 align:middle line:10%
And then step quick, quick,
quick, quick, little step,

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.110 align:middle line:10%
little step.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:24.190 align:middle line:10%
The reason for those little
steps is that wall of trees

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:10%
that he had to run
into and break through.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.170 align:middle line:10%
So here we go again.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.570 align:middle line:10%
This is just the way it
was originally filmed.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:33.282 align:middle line:10%
All very well
stabilized by Amanda.

00:29:33.282 --> 00:29:35.240 align:middle line:10%
All the way back through
the trees he's moving.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.290 align:middle line:10%
I don't hear anything there.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.873 align:middle line:10%
Then you see the trees shake in
that one spot Amanda zoomed in

00:29:38.873 --> 00:29:40.850 align:middle line:10%
on where he slipped up again.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:44.112 align:middle line:10%
Bang, bang into
the wall of trees.

00:29:44.112 --> 00:29:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What in God's
name, Todd, did we just see?

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Well,
that's 100% a Sasquatch.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was totally mistaken.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So I always try to
under-promise and overdeliver.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:90%
I said seven foot four.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Now we know for a fact,
it's been proven--

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:middle line:84%
because I was standing there and
I did a recall of the situation.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Someone pour me in side by
side with that Sasquatch.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.265 align:middle line:84%
He's over nine feet tall,
in excess of 900 pounds.

00:30:05.265 --> 00:30:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were two
feet short on him.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: That's the
end of the conversation.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.720 align:middle line:84%
You can't put a nine foot
tall person in a suit.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:90%
There isn't any.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.395 align:middle line:84%
I watched Harry Potter
when they did Hagrid.

00:30:15.395 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't make
him eight feet tall,

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and he walks around
very mechanically.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Warner Bros, with millions
of dollars worth of budget,

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:25.480 align:middle line:84%
couldn't do what I did in
2006 because it's not possible

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.132 align:middle line:84%
unless that's a real
bipedal being that exists.

00:30:30.132 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing too, when
I talk about how he slows down

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and he slips, a kineticist
analyzed that whole piece

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.860 align:middle line:84%
of footage and concluded that
a human being, the fastest

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:84%
man in the world, couldn't
do that in 21 seconds.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.635 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: And this individual,
after slipping and slowing--

00:30:44.635 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:90%
can you imagine a sprinter?

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.800 align:middle line:84%
If he slowed down before the
end, how slow his time would be?

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.315 align:middle line:90%
And that nine foot plus tall--

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:51.315 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:30:51.315 --> 00:30:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: It's not
possible to be anything

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.362 align:middle line:90%
other than a new species.

00:30:54.362 --> 00:30:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Before we get into
another incredible video,

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:84%
tell us about a tree episode
that happened to you.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.385 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: A tree episode?

00:31:00.385 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something fell on you?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Oh, in
video six, yeah.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So that was winter time, and
I was approaching a Sasquatch

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.860 align:middle line:90%
following his track.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.370 align:middle line:84%
She was dog-tracking
in his trackway

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and I have footage
that shows, again--

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.273 align:middle line:84%
this Sasquatch was probably
more around nine foot eight.

00:31:17.273 --> 00:31:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So an individual I
hadn't had experience

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.120 align:middle line:84%
with, and it was about three
feet of snow, minus 20.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.070 align:middle line:90%
As I approached him--

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:90%
so they always triangulate.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is like incredible
military intelligence and stuff.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at a Sasquatch
that wants to evade me.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.310 align:middle line:84%
A Sasquatch to my right
is growling at me,

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:90%
trying to get my attention.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And as I get too close,
it was the third Sasquatch

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.600 align:middle line:84%
that was off
triangulated to my left

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know
about that gently tossed

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.250 align:middle line:84%
a log at me to take
me out so I would

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:84%
stop pursuing the Sasquatch that
I was following a trackway of.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Did they
want to hurt you?

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: No.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:84%
If they ever wanted to
hurt me, you would never

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:90%
hear about Todd Standing again.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You would not
be sitting in this chair.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: No, no.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, I have to say
this very, very clearly.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:84%
They gently lobbed a log
at me to take me out.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
It hurt my shoulder to
this day, I could feel it.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It hurts, but it was
not meant to kill me.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And I have to make
that so clear.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Every eventuality that
ever had with them,

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.964 align:middle line:84%
they were nothing
short of gentle,

00:32:15.964 --> 00:32:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and made that they were
very careful not to harm me.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.860 align:middle line:84%
When you're that powerful, if
they were to just-- they could

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.325 align:middle line:90%
crush my head like a beer can.

00:32:23.325 --> 00:32:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, let's
take a look at the video

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.617 align:middle line:84%
you brought us
about this episode.

00:32:26.617 --> 00:32:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Sure.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:10%
We're walking up on a Sasquatch.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.200 align:middle line:10%
There's a trackway again that
you can see I'm zooming in on.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.530 align:middle line:10%
I've got a night light
or an infrared light.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.800 align:middle line:10%
That's the only reason my camera
can see anything right now.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.480 align:middle line:10%
It's pitch black, and I'm
about to walk up on a Sasquatch

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.370 align:middle line:10%
that you can see right now
in the middle of the screen.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.640 align:middle line:10%
But more importantly,
you're going

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.800 align:middle line:10%
to hear another Sasquatch
make itself well-known to me

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.980 align:middle line:10%
off to the right now.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:57.108 align:middle line:90%

[GROWLING]

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.822 align:middle line:10%
Now that I know I have
a Sasquatch that's

00:33:00.822 --> 00:33:02.790 align:middle line:10%
getting-- that's
protesting off to my right,

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:04.520 align:middle line:10%
I know I have to keep
moving forward and following

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:10%
this trackway.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:10%
At this point, I'm starting
to make something out directly

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.810 align:middle line:10%
in front of me.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:10%
Again, now I can hear
a Sasquatch moving up

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800 align:middle line:10%
on me to my right.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.030 align:middle line:10%
Just stepping in the snow.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:15.270 align:middle line:10%
However, I'm focused on that
directly in front of me.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:18.750 align:middle line:10%
Clearly, a back and an arm
are pointed back towards me,

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.318 align:middle line:10%
and this creature has no idea
that I can see it right now.

00:33:21.318 --> 00:33:23.610 align:middle line:10%
The reason I know it's there
is I've seen the trackway,

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:10%
and that is standing out
to me like a sore thumb.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.600 align:middle line:10%
There's tracks.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.720 align:middle line:10%
There's some very
large, enormous object.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.850 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to proceed
forward, as I always do.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.310 align:middle line:10%
So I'm getting a little
nervous right now.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:39.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm concerned about making
sure I have my focus.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.830 align:middle line:10%
This is a wild animal.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm approaching hundreds
of miles from the nearest

out in the middle of

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:51.045 align:middle line:10%
That's a Sasquatch.

00:33:51.045 --> 00:33:52.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to get my focus.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.350 align:middle line:10%

from the third Sasquatch.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:10%
I had no idea was there,
that was off to my left.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.780 align:middle line:10%
There were three of them.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.489 align:middle line:10%
They stood together.

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:18.219 align:middle line:10%
This is what happens.

an hour later.

I am 230 pounds.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm six foot five
with those boots on.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to stand
in that exact spot.

Now that you can see
it's completely vacant.

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:33.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm standing there
in the trackway,

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.185 align:middle line:10%
and when I jump or put
my arms in the air,

00:34:37.185 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:10%
my hands straight up in the
air are about eight foot six,

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.159 align:middle line:10%
which are still not reaching
the height of the Sasquatch

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.480 align:middle line:10%
that had just been
previously standing there.

They could make bird sounds.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.370 align:middle line:84%
If they want you to know you're
there, they'll let you know.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Their vocal range, though--

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is just an
example of what I experienced.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.887 align:middle line:84%
So Les Stroud, Survivorman,
is a professional singer.

00:36:01.887 --> 00:36:03.220 align:middle line:90%
He's got incredible vocal cords.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.870 align:middle line:90%
He's a trained singer.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:08.890 align:middle line:84%
He made a Sasquatch call under
my guidance that was beautiful.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:13.810 align:middle line:84%
All he did was just-- he went,
[VOCALIZING] It was beautiful.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Two minutes later, we heard that
exact sound duplicated back to

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:19.300 align:middle line:90%
is 10 times louder.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:20.965 align:middle line:90%
[VOCALIZING]

00:36:20.965 --> 00:36:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: It was in the
show, and we stop in our tracks

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.575 align:middle line:84%
and we're like,
what just happened?

00:36:24.575 --> 00:36:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And where did
that come from, right?

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: And what happened
was the Sasquatch heard us

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:90%
down low.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:84%
He ran to the top
of a mountain, which

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I went and found the
trackway, would take me

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.070 align:middle line:90%
45 minutes to do in good shape.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:84%
He ran to that top of
the mountain to get that,

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:39.760 align:middle line:90%
to make sure we heard the call.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.230 align:middle line:90%
And then he pounded it back.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So their lung capacity,
their vocal capabilities

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:84%
are minimally, I would
say, five times what

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.750 align:middle line:84%
a professional singer like
Les Stroud is capable of,

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.030 align:middle line:90%
which is hard to believe.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Have they ever grabbed
you or anything like that?

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Yes.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Especially one time, people
like to talk about, where--

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.600 align:middle line:84%
it's footage where I have a
flare and it's red footage.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's a day of Sasquatch
actually made physical contact

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:84%
with me, picked me up
in a way that I've heard

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.750 align:middle line:90%
many other people talk about.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Legitimate people that
have been picked up

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:90%
and moved by Sasquatch.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.710 align:middle line:84%
They have a very
specific technique

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.860 align:middle line:84%
to pick up a human being and
then hold them on the hips

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.040 align:middle line:90%
and move off with them.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:84%
It's actually-- I
don't know how to say--

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:26.520 align:middle line:84%
it's comfortable the way
they hold you up like that.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's comfortable
anatomically.

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.160 align:middle line:84%
It's terrifying
physically because I've

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.670 align:middle line:90%
played high-level football.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I've wrestled with
330-pound men in football.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has ever picked me up and
tossed me around anywhere near.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.418 align:middle line:84%
A Sasquatch picked me
up like a rag doll.

00:37:43.418 --> 00:37:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Like a rag doll.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.035 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: And
just like gently.

00:37:46.035 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Like, he didn't whip me, but
he just latched onto my hips

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.230 align:middle line:90%
with his hand.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How big was the
hand next to your hand?

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Oh,
there's no comparison.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me hit my hips--

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:57.160 align:middle line:84%
his hand went all the way
across my hips comfortably,

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:90%
you could see.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm talking probably
three times the size of me.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:02.765 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: And
the power, if you

00:38:02.765 --> 00:38:04.460 align:middle line:84%
know about gorilla
hand strength,

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.140 align:middle line:84%
so it's bigger than
a gorilla hand,

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.060 align:middle line:90%
significantly more powerful.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And then he ran
with me off terrain

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.936 align:middle line:90%
like I couldn't even believe.

00:38:13.936 --> 00:38:16.555 align:middle line:84%
Simply, it's like throwing my
weight on the back of a horse.

00:38:16.555 --> 00:38:17.680 align:middle line:90%
The horse barely feels my--

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had some videotape
of the episode where they

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.430 align:middle line:90%

And they live hard lives.

They're tough beings and
even that, there's so much.

I hadn't slept properly

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't eaten solid
food in five days,

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.230 align:middle line:84%
so that's after I had
gotten the Jane footage.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.647 align:middle line:84%
So I'd come back
and I had footage

00:41:00.647 --> 00:41:01.780 align:middle line:90%
and I was very successful.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But what I wanted
was-- for years

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.265 align:middle line:84%
I'd wanted a spiritual
animal ritual.

00:41:05.265 --> 00:41:06.640 align:middle line:84%
You've probably
heard about that.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I didn't realize is
the Sasquatch performance.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And so what they're doing
is-- even when I'm saying,

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.620 align:middle line:90%
what are you doing here?

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
trying to push me--

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.968 align:middle line:84%
they kept trying to push me
back into the wilderness.

00:41:14.968 --> 00:41:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And previously, there was
always watching me, allowing

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.610 align:middle line:84%
me to leave and pushing
me out, and now they're

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:20.410 align:middle line:90%
pushing me back in.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:21.743 align:middle line:90%
So it was very perplexing to me.

00:41:21.743 --> 00:41:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It was terrifying because
I'm trying to leave

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and they don't really
want me to leave,

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and now they're trying
to push me back.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
Sasquatch picked me up

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:90%
because I wasn't going back.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.560 align:middle line:84%
He picked me up and carried
me back into the wilderness.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I just wasn't
getting the message.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Did he hurt you?

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Were you injured?

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Not at all.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:36.490 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:37.365 align:middle line:90%
I had injured myself.

00:41:37.365 --> 00:41:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I had hurt my knee
pretty significantly.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
day, when I woke up,

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.490 align:middle line:84%
after where he'd left me,
a grizzly bear chased me

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:45.370 align:middle line:90%
up the mountain.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.448 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
actually did the proper--

00:41:47.448 --> 00:41:48.490 align:middle line:90%
where I take people now--

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I took Survivorman,
I take other people

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and show them this
holy place where

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.735 align:middle line:84%
the Sasquatch performs spiritual
animal rituals on human beings.

00:41:55.735 --> 00:41:57.360 align:middle line:84%

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.050 align:middle line:90%
they've saved my life, yeah.

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:01.115 align:middle line:90%
Not that day, particularly.

00:42:01.115 --> 00:42:02.475 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us
one of the stories.

00:42:02.475 --> 00:42:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: Sure.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So on a day I
actually got footage,

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.590 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't
supposed to be there,

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:10.310 align:middle line:90%
I ended up dropping the camera.

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.020 align:middle line:84%
The Sasquatch,
Seager approached me,

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.050 align:middle line:84%
smashing a rock on the ground
and absolutely terrified me.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So I left my camera and I ran
from them, which you don't do.

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.370 align:middle line:84%
As I was running from them, they
were running up alongside of me,

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and they'd kind of bump me in
the back and I'd fall down.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And what eventually
happened was I

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:31.280 align:middle line:84%
ran into a log that had
a broken branch on it,

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.690 align:middle line:90%
and it stabbed me in the leg.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:35.993 align:middle line:84%
So I kept moving along as
best I could, but my boot was

00:42:35.993 --> 00:42:38.410 align:middle line:84%
filling up with blood and I
was bleeding quite profoundly.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, that time,
I had not eaten

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.320 align:middle line:90%
or drank water in two days.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.648 align:middle line:84%
You have to do that to be
stealth, to really go on--

00:42:44.648 --> 00:42:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: One more day you're
dead, for crying out loud.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.482 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: So what
actually happened

00:42:48.482 --> 00:42:51.870 align:middle line:84%
was that night, as I was
coming across a cliff edge

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:54.090 align:middle line:84%
on the top of a
mountain, I slipped off

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:56.860 align:middle line:84%
of some ice that was on a
glacier that was melting,

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and I fell into the creek
and went unconscious.

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:01.010 align:middle line:90%
That's death.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who pulled you out?

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:03.105 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: They did.

00:43:03.105 --> 00:43:04.930 align:middle line:84%
The next day, I woke
up on the ridge.

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I could see the
drag marks where I

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:09.250 align:middle line:84%
was dragged up onto the ridge
where there was sunlight.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So out of the creek
that I'd fallen in,

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.270 align:middle line:90%
dragged up onto that ridge.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And the injury was fixed
up to the point where

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:20.350 align:middle line:84%
when I-- so when I did get
back and I went to a doctor,

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:21.840 align:middle line:90%
he said, well, who did this?

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go, oh, it was
some medicine man, a Native guy.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.215 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, let
me tell you something.

00:43:26.215 --> 00:43:27.233 align:middle line:90%
That's clean.

00:43:27.233 --> 00:43:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And how many days
have you had it?

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:30.817 align:middle line:84%
At that time I'd had it for
like three or four days.

00:43:30.817 --> 00:43:33.595 align:middle line:84%
It's clean and sealed in a
way like I've never seen.

00:43:33.595 --> 00:43:35.220 align:middle line:84%
If I pull that off,
it's going to bleed

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.887 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to have
to stitch that up.

00:43:36.887 --> 00:43:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So if this breaks
open, come back to me.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, whoever
put that together--

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Leave it.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: --I'm impressed.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: And it literally
came off about 10 days later.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And that huge hole
that was that big

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:50.100 align:middle line:84%
that they would have had to
stitch up, that I also bled out

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.990 align:middle line:90%
through was--

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's barely
a scar to this day.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've learned
from Sasquatch, haven't you?

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.073 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: They're my teachers.

00:43:58.073 --> 00:43:59.440 align:middle line:90%
I am a student of theirs.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I literally as a technologically
advanced human being,

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.570 align:middle line:84%
have nothing to teach
them other than humans

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:09.092 align:middle line:84%
are a dangerous species, and
they should be wary of us.

00:44:09.092 --> 00:44:10.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what I can teach them.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Other than that,
they are the masters

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.150 align:middle line:84%
of the wilderness, which is
what the term Sasquatch actually

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.950 align:middle line:90%
means.

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.505 align:middle line:84%
It means wilderness master
by the Squamish people.

00:44:18.505 --> 00:44:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you listen to
all these Native people,

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.308 align:middle line:84%
they call them the
boss of the mountains,

00:44:22.308 --> 00:44:23.850 align:middle line:84%
shadow guardian of
the mountains, all

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.380 align:middle line:90%
these enduring terms.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.405 align:middle line:84%
Because they are such a
dominant species in wilderness.

00:44:29.405 --> 00:44:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
they help us evolve?

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: By helping
us go to the next level.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.530 align:middle line:90%
They're teaching telepathy.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.745 align:middle line:84%
They're teaching
connectivity to nature.

00:44:37.745 --> 00:44:39.120 align:middle line:84%
They're teaching
how important it

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.210 align:middle line:84%
is to be organic and
have that wildness to us.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:44.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take a
rocket scientist

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.880 align:middle line:84%
to know that the way people are
looking at dopamine hit videos

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.090 align:middle line:84%
online that are so popular,
that children are not connecting

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.850 align:middle line:84%
to nature, that boys that
want to get out and play

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:55.770 align:middle line:84%
are put in classrooms
and given drugs

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and said, you just be
a zombie, that's bad.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.010 align:middle line:90%
That's very, very bad for us.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:02.110 align:middle line:84%
We need to reconnect
with our wildness,

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and only a wild
thing can be free.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So the more domesticated we
get, the less we are wild

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.340 align:middle line:90%
and the less we are free.

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:12.040 align:middle line:84%
People need to understand
that, we need to get back to.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
freedom like, I can walk.

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:15.940 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm talking about nature.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about real wildness.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.570 align:middle line:84%
They're the ultimate wild
bipedal hominid, our closest

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:22.600 align:middle line:90%
living relative.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.040 align:middle line:90%
They will teach us telepathy.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.690 align:middle line:84%
They will teach us how to truly
thrive in nature on a quantum

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.290 align:middle line:84%
level that they
are so brilliant at

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.950 align:middle line:90%
and they are so successful with.

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.695 align:middle line:84%
And I can prove that
because I've worked

00:45:35.695 --> 00:45:36.820 align:middle line:90%
with the best in the world.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I am, if not the best, one of
the best trackers in the world

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.210 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to North
American terrain.

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:44.535 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I would say you are.

00:45:44.535 --> 00:45:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Thousands of days
of back country wilderness

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:48.050 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I tell
you this is I have never

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:51.742 align:middle line:90%
had the upper hand on them.

00:45:51.742 --> 00:45:53.450 align:middle line:84%
The only time I ever
thought I was ahead,

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:54.920 align:middle line:84%
it was because I
was so far behind.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you scared of them?

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STANDING: No, no.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I've come to peace with
this a very long time ago.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:04.240 align:middle line:84%
If a Sasquatch wants me
gone, I will disappear.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Every time I've
ever gone out there,

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:07.520 align:middle line:84%
not only are they
receptive to me,

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.410 align:middle line:84%
but they protect me
and keep me safe.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:10.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing things
that are impossible.

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:12.830 align:middle line:84%
My expeditioners have
never been harmed.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I take them out into black bear,
grizzly bear, mountain lion

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:16.130 align:middle line:90%
country.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:18.320 align:middle line:84%
We go into the most
dangerous places with food.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.758 align:middle line:84%
And over a decade now, I've
been doing that unharmed.

00:46:21.758 --> 00:46:23.300 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
way you can do that,

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and I don't care how
skilled a human being are,

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.270 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to make it.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:27.110 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have a bear attack.

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:28.250 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have a
mountain lion attack.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:29.630 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
piss off the wolves.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.490 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can do
that is if you're protected

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:33.537 align:middle line:84%
and the Sasquatch keep
me safe and protect me.

00:46:33.537 --> 00:46:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What keeps
driving you, Todd?

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STANDING: Oh, because
humanity needs this discovery.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Enlightened individuals
can learn so much.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:45.210 align:middle line:84%
The Sasquatch want
human beings to ascend

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.250 align:middle line:84%
to that other level of
telepathy, of connectivity

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:49.050 align:middle line:90%
to nature.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And people, many people,
like, pretty much

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.710 align:middle line:90%
your entire network get that.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.060 align:middle line:90%
We need to ascend.

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And once we ascend, once
the people become telepathic

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and become free and open,
they're going to run things.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Sasquatch
want those people.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.080 align:middle line:10%
And the Sasquatch are
reaching out to us

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.580 align:middle line:10%
to help us move
in that direction,

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.360 align:middle line:10%
because we are ultimately very
responsible for the health

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.500 align:middle line:10%
of this planet in many ways.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.890 align:middle line:10%
And they want us to find the
light and through telepathy,

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:20.740 align:middle line:10%
through nature is the light.

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:23.560 align:middle line:84%
That is where we can
exist and thrive.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And we need to stop
becoming so technological

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and move back to the power
of the natural world.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they're
teaching, and they love it.

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.648 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so passionate
about that because that

00:47:33.648 --> 00:47:34.940 align:middle line:90%
makes the world a better place.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.586 align:middle line:84%
