[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MATTHEW LACROIX: They found
the ancient ruins of Eridu.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.210 align:middle line:84%
They went out in-- the
University of Oxford

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
in the 1940s went out,
identified where the site was,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.800 align:middle line:84%
walked around, took pictures,
and, as far as I know,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.660 align:middle line:90%
never returned.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: What do
you mean, never returned?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.707 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's the
ultimate question.

00:00:26.707 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:84%
If you have something like
this that's so fundamentally

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:84%
important, how
could something like

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.858 align:middle line:84%
that just slip through
the cracks and disappear?

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you compare
some of these structures

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.082 align:middle line:90%
to modern-day buildings today?

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think
that we're still

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.165 align:middle line:84%
trying to catch up
with what they knew.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The one block that's
shown there is the largest

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.303 align:middle line:90%
single block in the world.

00:00:44.303 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It's called the trilithon,
and it weighs 1,100 tons.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have machinery
today that can't move that.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Isn't that amazing?

>>NOORY: Welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:10%
We've got a great
guest for you--

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:10%
Matthew LaCroix, an
author and researcher.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And while attending
college, he began

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
studying archeology,
history, philosophy,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:90%
and quantum mechanics.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Matthew, welcome
to "Beyond Belief."

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Great to have you.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Thanks, George.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.928 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: By the way, I'm
still getting response

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:17.595 align:middle line:84%
from the radio show you
did with us four years ago.

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah,
I really enjoyed

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:84%
those coast-to-coast
shows with you.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:84%
That's why I've been so
looking forward to sitting down

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:90%
to talk to you again.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you get
involved in ancient archeology

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.283 align:middle line:90%
and civilizations?

00:01:28.283 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, it
really wasn't a path

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:90%
that I planned for.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:10%
It was something that sort
of fell right into my lap

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:10%
by accident.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:10%
And it was one of those
things that a lot of people

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.052 align:middle line:10%
talk about being a
rabbit hole, where

00:01:39.052 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:10%
you sort of glimpse
into it a little bit,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:10%
and then you want more--

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: And it gets deeper
and deeper and deeper?

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
You just keep wanting to
ask more and more questions.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, before you know
it, you're all the way down,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.618 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at things
in a completely different way,

00:01:50.618 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to understand all

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:90%
these mysteries of the past.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
past civilizations

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
are fascinating to
investigate, aren't they?

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, it
captivates my imagination.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Trying to understand
something-- a culture that's

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:90%
completely gone and vanished.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
To try to imagine
how sophisticated

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.389 align:middle line:90%
they could have been.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Especially based on the
evidence we're looking at.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
We really get a much different
picture of those civilizations

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:84%
than just being nomadic
hunter-gatherers

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
that then, all of a sudden,
eventually became civilized.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a very different story.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matthew,
where do you think

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:84%
the cradle of
civilization began?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, that's
a great question.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think the history
books do get that right

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
with being the Fertile
Crescent of Mesopotamia,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.655 align:middle line:84%
near the confluence of the
Tigris and Euphrates River.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Which is modern-day
Iraq right now, right?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Exactly, which--
a lot of this instability

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.437 align:middle line:84%
in those areas preventing
a lot of archeologists

00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
from getting into
those ancient sites.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:84%
But I really do
think that, as we're

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
going to get into
talk about, we're

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.778 align:middle line:84%
talking about multiple
epics of different groups

00:02:49.778 --> 00:02:51.820 align:middle line:84%
that have been there,
rather than just one group.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Epics of
Gilgamesh and stuff like that?

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, and that's one
of the great sets of tablets

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:84%
that I love to read and find
some of the secrets in there.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The late Zecharia
Sitchin was obsessed with

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki, which he claims
came to us from another planet

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:84%
called Nibiru, which is on a
3,600-year elliptical orbit.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:90%
It comes and goes.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Every time it gets
close, there's

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.070 align:middle line:84%
some kind of major Earth change,
and then it goes away again.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But he claims they
came here, seeded

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.215 align:middle line:84%
us because they needed workers
to pull gold out of the planet.

00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
of that theory?

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, I want to
give Zecharia Sitchin credit

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
for really getting
the narrative started.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.450 align:middle line:84%
He was the one who brought
a lot of these really

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
mysterious texts that
a lot of people thought

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.630 align:middle line:84%
were just poems or parables,
and he brought this to life,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
talking about the Anunnaki, what
their role was with our story,

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:90%
and how we came here.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.035 align:middle line:84%
And how we came about
with civilization rising

00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and the influences
that they had.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, to me, he was
the pioneer behind it.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:90%
But I wanted to know more.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to understand
directly from the tablets.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the things
that became one of my major

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:84%
focuses, was finding out
who translated them the most

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:84%
accurately, and then really
getting in and studying them

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
for years and years and
years to really understand

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:90%
what this ancient story was.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So, Matthew, let's
look at some of these tablets,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you can
interpret them for us.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Sure.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Here's our first one.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:10%
What is this?

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: So, the
first time that we're

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.292 align:middle line:10%
going to be reading is not one
that most people are aware of.

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:10%
It was one that I did some
digging and actually found.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.238 align:middle line:10%
And to me, it connected to so
many other tablets that I read.

00:04:29.238 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Where did you find it?

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: This was just
one of the ones where--

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
the University of Oxford
has a great library

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:90%
cataloging a lot of these.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:10%
So, the tablet
essentially describes

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:10%
how kingship descended
down from heaven,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.590 align:middle line:10%
and the first place that
kingship was lowered to

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:10%
was Eridu.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:10%
And then it goes on to talk
about how, in Urdu, Alulim

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:10%
became the king.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:10%
And it talks about this
extended amount of years

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.568 align:middle line:10%
that he ruled for.

00:04:51.568 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through
and it keeps mentioning

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
how the city would
fall, and the kingship

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:90%
was taken to another city.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes
on and on and on.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:10%
But the part that I also
particularly want to point out

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:10%
is at the end, when
it mentions here.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:10%
It says at the end,
then Sippar fell,

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.750 align:middle line:10%
and the kingship was
taken to Suruppak.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.490 align:middle line:10%
And if you see right
below Suruppak,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:10%
it says, then the
flood swept over.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Giving us, George, a
way to try to measure

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.862 align:middle line:90%
when this event occurred.

00:05:16.862 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're
able to understand

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.442 align:middle line:90%
when that flood was--

00:05:19.442 --> 00:05:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is this
the flood of Noah?

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That's right.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the flood
which I've traced back

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:84%
to really looking at things like
ice core samples, to geology,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and all these different
pieces of evidence

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
to what's known as the Younger
Dryas cataclysms, which

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.037 align:middle line:84%
is around between 12,800 years
ago and about 11,000 years ago.

00:05:35.037 --> 00:05:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, they
talk about the king

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.570 align:middle line:90%
ruling for 28,000 years.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.150 align:middle line:90%
A king ruling for 36,000 years.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:90%
How can that be?

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's so
mysterious, isn't it, George?

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
is the challenge behind this

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:84%
was that they didn't actually
catalog these or record them

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:90%
in years.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.250 align:middle line:84%
They recorded them in
what is known as shars.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the shars represented
a certain amount of time.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And interpreting that amount
of time has been difficult.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Who do you think the
authors were of those tablets?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, that's a
good question because one

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.720 align:middle line:84%
of the things you find when
you look at the Sumerians,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Sumerians
in Mesopotamia,

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and then you look at later
cultures like the Akkadians

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:84%
or the Babylonians,
you find versions

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
of those tablets that were
rewritten and translated

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:90%
in the later groups.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.530 align:middle line:84%
But they all translate from
the ancient Sumerian stories

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.330 align:middle line:90%
originally.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's look
at our second tablet

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.842 align:middle line:90%
and tell us what this is.

00:06:22.842 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.767 align:middle line:84%
What are we looking
at here, Matt?

00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: So, here we go.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
We have another one of these
tablets that really brings

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:84%
the same types of information
we find for the previous tablet

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:90%
in here.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And this tablet is known
as the Eridu Genesis.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:10%
And I want to point
out that-- notice

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:10%
the same type of language
that's used, George.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:10%
We see this royal
scepter from heaven,

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:10%
the same thing as kingshipped.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.620 align:middle line:10%
Just another way
of saying kingship.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:10%
When it was lowered
from heaven, it

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:10%
talks about how it
was brought down

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.227 align:middle line:10%
and the first city was created.

00:06:55.227 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:10%
And, as it says, just
like the other tablet,

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:10%
Eridu was the
first city created.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:84%
The tablets mimic each other
with the same information.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, the name of
their, Nudimmud,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
is actually another
name for Enki,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.730 align:middle line:84%
meaning that the first
city ever created--

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We've heard
of that name, sure.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --was basically
given to this leader, Enki.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:10%
And that provides
us with a background

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.560 align:middle line:10%
to try to understand when
these cities existed,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:10%
who ruled in those
cities, and what

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:10%
the influences were of those.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.195 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where is modern-day
Eridu now, do you think?

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So, that's
a great question.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.210 align:middle line:84%
One of the areas that
I've really studied

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:84%
is trying to figure
that out, right?

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Where is Eridu?

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.133 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where are
these places, yeah.

00:07:35.133 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: If it's the
first city ever created

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:84%
for civilization, and it's
carried over by tablet

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.038 align:middle line:84%
after tablet, to
me, it would be one

00:07:42.038 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
of the most important
ancient sites in the world.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, one of the
things you find, George--

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And there should
be some remnants of this.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That's right.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.583 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that you'll find

00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:84%
is that there was an
archeological dig that

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
was done in the 1940s by
the University of Oxford.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And they went out into Iraq,
near the Euphrates and Tigris

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:84%
rivers, and they found
the ancient ruins of Eridu

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.830 align:middle line:90%
sitting out in the desert.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you go and
you look into images,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.290 align:middle line:84%
which I think we're going to be
showing one of those coming up,

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:84%
you see this giant area
of disturbed ground

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.440 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the desert.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
around it, guarding it.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:90%
There's no fences.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:90%
There's no tourism.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.748 align:middle line:84%
There's no archeologists
doing digs.

00:08:22.748 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's just there.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: They went out--

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
the University of
Oxford in the 1940s

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
went out, identified where the
site was, walked around, took

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
pictures, and, as far as
I know, never returned.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
mean, never returned?

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's the
ultimate question.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:84%
If you have something like
this that's so fundamentally

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
important, how
could something like

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
that just slip through
the cracks and disappear?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, it's sitting
in the middle of the desert

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.940 align:middle line:84%
without any kind of
archeological study being

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:90%
done on it.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's largely being
ignored by modern academics.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had the guest
the complexity of the space,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:90%
how big is it?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.642 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: It's enormous.

00:08:58.642 --> 00:09:01.320 align:middle line:84%
It contains its own
ziggurat, as well as

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:84%
other remnants of temples and
many, many other structures.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's so ancient
that all we have left

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:84%
are largely sand that's
blowing in over it

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and buried it underneath
layers and layers of debris

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.520 align:middle line:90%
and sediment.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.895 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matthew,
when they found

00:09:15.895 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx in Egypt, the
sand was up to its eyes,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:90%
practically.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Just the little top of
it was sticking out.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Would that be the same
thing as this city, Eridu?

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That's right.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:84%
It seems like, rather than
history all falling into this

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:84%
6,000-year window, things are
much older than modern academia

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:90%
wants to give credit for.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And so what we find is
that different time periods

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.980 align:middle line:84%
of cultures that came
and went, and then

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:84%
other civilizations found
their remnants, their ruins,

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and either built on
top of it, or it just

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
remained in the desert,
and sand blew in

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.280 align:middle line:90%
until it was almost covered up.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.947 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why aren't
they digging it out?

00:09:48.947 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, again,
that's that question that

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
takes you down that
rabbit hole, just

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.630 align:middle line:90%
like we mentioned with Eridu.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
This amazingly
important ancient site

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:84%
sitting there in
a war-torn region

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
that is being ignored and
not even being uncovered.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:84%
It really begs the
question of, is this just

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
disrupting the
narrative that's been

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
established for civilizations
in human history?

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps those things
that don't fit in,

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:84%
those pieces of archeology
that don't fit that narrative,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:84%
are just quietly being
pushed to the side.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.347 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there any
megalithic structures there?

00:10:19.347 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: There is.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:90%
There's actually one in Iraq.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I
don't think there's

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:84%
more megalithic structures
there is the type of geology.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:90%
But there is one.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:84%
It's known as Khinnis Rock, and
it's actually just a little bit

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:84%
north of Nineveh near the
ancient aqueducts of Jerwan.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:84%
In Nineveh, there's a
place called Khinnis Rock,

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's this massive rock
relief on a vertical plane.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And it basically has
the Assyrian versions

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:51.420 align:middle line:84%
of the Sumerian gods, of
Enlil and his consort.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:90%
And his name in that is Assur.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's up on this massive
rock relief, basically

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.090 align:middle line:84%
passing knowledge to
these other civilizations.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's so ancient, though,
George, that a lot of it

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:84%
is broken away and there's
only pieces of it that remain.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But just like Eridu nearby,
it's not being studied at all.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It's just sitting there,
largely ignored today.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are there structures,
megalithic structures,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.058 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet, Matthew?

00:11:17.058 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: There
is, and some of them

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.590 align:middle line:84%
are much more
sophisticated than others.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But what we really
do find is that when

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:84%
we can trace the type
of building practices--

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:84%
no brick and mortar, but using
straight, giant megalithic

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.747 align:middle line:84%
rocks and basically carving
them with such precision

00:11:34.747 --> 00:11:37.080 align:middle line:84%
that you can't even fit a
human hair or a piece of paper

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.950 align:middle line:90%
through them.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
When we can identify that
type of stone masonry,

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
we know that that's one of what
I call the lost civilizations.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Those ancient cultures
that had advanced building

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
practices and knowledge,
and even tools, that became

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:84%
wiped out and disappeared,
and then cultures came later--

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Just gone,
like the pyramids.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That's right.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to mimic them,
but they weren't able to.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.252 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How would you compare
some of these structures

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:02.382 align:middle line:90%
to modern-day buildings today?

00:12:02.382 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think
that we're still

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.465 align:middle line:84%
trying to catch up
with what they knew.

00:12:05.465 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I know, and that
seems hard for some people

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:90%
to wrap their heads around.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to a place like
the Valley Temple of Egypt,

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:84%
or you go across
the world into Peru

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and you go to Ollantaytamo
or Sacsayhuaman,

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:84%
or you look at any
of those areas--

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu, where some of
the older structures are.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of the precision that's
with those stone masonry

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.557 align:middle line:84%
is, from a lot a
lot of the experts

00:12:29.557 --> 00:12:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that have gone to look at it,
even beyond our capability

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On the Gaia show
"Ancient Civilizations,"

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Collins talks
about Baalbek in Lebanon.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing structure,
as you well know.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDREW COLLINS: Baalbek is
one of the big enigmas of which

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:10%
there is very little answers.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a huge
complex that was constructed

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:90%
during Roman times.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
A massive temple dedicated
to the god Jupiter.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:10%
Amongst the foundations
of this incredible complex

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:10%
are stone blocks weighing
around 1,000 tons apiece.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:90%
But the big question comes--

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:84%
did they reuse those
stones, those big ones?

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:90%
The thousand tonners.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And if they did re-use them, who
the hell created those stones

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:90%
And why so large?

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's incredible,
what he just said, Matthew.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.330 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: To me, when I've
studied the megalithic ruins

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.530 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
like we mentioned,

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
not just being something
like Stonehenge,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:84%
but more of using massive
blocks to connect together

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.180 align:middle line:84%
to create some kind of an
incredible structure, what you

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:84%
find is that Baalbek
was where they

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:84%
perfected their megalithic tool
design to create these blocks.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Collins did
a great job showing

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:84%
some of those huge blocks that
are on some of the lower parts.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did they move them?

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Absolutely amazing.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you, George,
that the one block that's

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
shown there is the largest
single block in the world.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.340 align:middle line:84%
It's called the trilithon,
and it weighs 1,100 tons.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have machinery
today that can't move that.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Isn't that amazing?

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And they've actually
had construction workers

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:84%
look at some of those enormous
blocks to try to understand.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And our largest cranes today
would have difficulty, if not

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:84%
even be able to move
some of those blocks.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think happened,

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Matthew, with the knowledge
that simply disappeared?

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they had a civilization.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they made
these structures.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
But where'd the information
go from that point

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:90%
to where we are today?

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, so
what we find when

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:84%
we look at a combination
of ancient writings

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and geologic evidence
and ice core samples,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:84%
we really find that
there have been

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:84%
cyclical series of cataclysms,
these disasters that

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.947 align:middle line:90%
have happened on the Earth.

00:14:59.947 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like
the ancient cultures

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.880 align:middle line:90%
knew about them, though.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And they created
temples to try to map

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
the heavens to try to understand
when they would happen.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
example like Baalbek,

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.760 align:middle line:84%
there's actually a
quarry near Baalbek

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
where they were quarrying
those enormous stones.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.868 align:middle line:84%
And when you find is that the
largest stones were actually

00:15:17.868 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:84%
not even taken out
of the ground yet.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.202 align:middle line:84%
They were in the middle
of working on them.

00:15:21.202 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And what you find is--

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're still there?

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah,
they're still there.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.218 align:middle line:84%
And they never got a chance to
take them out of the ground.

00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Which means that, instead
of their culture having

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a slow
downfall, it was

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.742 align:middle line:90%
a rapid end to their culture--

00:15:31.742 --> 00:15:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It was abrupt.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:90%
It just ended.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exactly.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And all the work
stopped out of nowhere,

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.692 align:middle line:84%
just like we find in Aswan,
Egypt with the giant obelisk

00:15:38.692 --> 00:15:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the other
structures in the world.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:84%
These cultures had a very
rapid end to their building,

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and they largely
disappeared after that.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And just disappeared.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Could it have been in a
craft, and off they went?

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The disappearance of
the technologies and the wisdom

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:84%
that they had, we don't
really know where it went.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:15:59.423 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could it
be ET information?

00:15:59.423 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
that's the thing,

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.673 align:middle line:84%
is we're not really
sure where it came from.

00:16:02.673 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And we can try to
perhaps connect

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki for being perhaps
these wisdom bringers that

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
provided some of this knowledge,
but we don't truly understand.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.903 align:middle line:84%
But one of the peculiar things
that a great researcher, Brien

00:16:13.903 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Foerster, who I'm
sure you're aware of--

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Good guy.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:90%
He's one of my favorites.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
He points out that we don't
find any tools anywhere

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Nowhere.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Not one.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:90%
So where did they go?

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
bizarre things about this,

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:84%
is that if whoever
built those left,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:84%
it would make sense
that the tools they had,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:90%
they took with them.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
only explanation.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they
buried them, did they?

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:84%
In the Hall of
Records somewhere?

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:41.887 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: If they
buried them, we

00:16:41.887 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:84%
would have found
something by now.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So, they're all gone.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That's right.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And those cultures that
came after them tried

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:90%
to mimic them in many ways.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu is
actually a great example

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:84%
for those who want
to go look at those

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and check out images
or visit the site.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
But you find those
incredibly precise blocks

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:90%
on the lower levels.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And on the top, what we
think of as the Inca,

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.408 align:middle line:84%
you find more primitive
brick and mortar

00:17:03.408 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
where they were
trying to mimic them,

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.605 align:middle line:84%
but they had nowhere
near the knowledge

00:17:06.605 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that those previous
cultures did.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: On one hand,
Matthew, it's exciting.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's also
frustrating, isn't it?

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It is because there's
such a lack of coordination

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:84%
with the academic
world to get in there

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:90%
and actually study these.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
And so it's left to individuals
that are just doing this

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.276 align:middle line:84%
because it's a passion thing
for them, because they want--

00:17:25.276 --> 00:17:26.276 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They love this.

00:17:26.276 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, we--

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As you do.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:84%
We truly love this because
it's uncovering the truth.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.090 align:middle line:84%
The truth of the past
that has been buried

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.678 align:middle line:84%
and remains a mystery
to most of society.

00:17:38.678 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to
ask you to speculate.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Sure.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.558 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do
you think happened

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:90%
to these civilizations?

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: There's been
two camps, I think,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:84%
on this side of looking
at-- one camp looks at this

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
as some kind of an
ancient cataclysm

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.750 align:middle line:84%
from a series of
comets or asteroids.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the other camp,
individuals like Robert Schoch,

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:84%
look at this from some
kind of a solar event.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.687 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of a mass
coronal, mass ejection,

00:18:02.687 --> 00:18:03.520 align:middle line:90%
or a solar outburst.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It still
doesn't explain

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.420 align:middle line:84%
how the tools have disappeared
and stuff like that.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's
right, it doesn't.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But the only thing that
is interesting though,

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:84%
George, is, when you read
some of those tablets,

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:84%
it mentions how the Anunnaki
actually created that event

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to occur on Earth, that
deluge, that destructive event.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:90%
And they mention how they left.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.007 align:middle line:84%
It actually states they
left here during that event.

00:18:25.007 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So, maybe they brought
those tools back with them.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: In a craft somewhere?

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: We don't know.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
one of the most--

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you say left,
what do you mean by that?

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
it's so peculiar,

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:37.080 align:middle line:84%
George, because all around
the world, Saudi Arabia

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.150 align:middle line:84%
all the way down
through South America,

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
we find these giant
doorways, these gateways.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Gateways to the gods where
it just seems to go nowhere.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just a giant stone doorway,
either in a rock cliff--

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like a portal's
behind it or something?

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That's right.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
It seems like there
was technology

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that once existed that no
longer is around anymore.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And all those
technologies that they

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:84%
had to utilize those
things are gone,

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and now we just look at some
kind of a rock structure,

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't really
make any sense to us.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They open this portal.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:90%
In they go.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.047 align:middle line:90%
And they're gone.

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: From as much
as that I've studied this,

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:84%
really looking at the Anunnaki
and these ancient influences

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.250 align:middle line:84%
of them, it seems
like the doorway

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:84%
theory of being able
to travel somewhere

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:84%
makes more sense
to me than a craft.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: David
Paulides in his book,

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.330 align:middle line:84%
"Missing 411," talks
about how people simply

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:90%
vanish in state parks.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:90%
They're just gone.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And it could be very
well the same possibility

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.280 align:middle line:84%
that they're stumbling into
some other portal or dimension

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:90%
that you can't see.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.997 align:middle line:90%
And they never can come back.

00:19:41.997 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That's a great point.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
fully understand,

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:84%
even though we think we're so
advanced in our modern society

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot
of the nature of reality

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and understanding these
types of ancient mysteries

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
that we just don't
understand today.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you
think a catastrophe

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.540 align:middle line:90%
occurred, primarily?

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think they
just picked up and left?

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, or a series of
catastrophes, actually, George.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Seems like
maybe there would

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:90%
have been several in a row.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Because when I
study these tablets

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and how they state that these
different epochs occurred

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:84%
with these kingships in
these different cities,

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I've actually separated into
three different time periods.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that there were
likely two, potentially three,

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:90%
of these events.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Could
they happen again?

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Catastrophes?

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, that's
the big question, right?

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:84%
If you look at this and you
look at ice core samples from

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Greenland and you try to get a
snapshot for when these types

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.930 align:middle line:84%
of events occur, it seems like
they fall around a 12,000-

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.980 align:middle line:90%
to 13,000-year cycle.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Which, if you were to look at
when that last occurred based

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
on what we mentioned
during the Younger Dryas,

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.690 align:middle line:84%
were right in that
time period right now.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are many
symbols all around this planet

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient worlds.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Symbols
hold, in my opinion,

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:90%
the greatest secrets of all.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the most
difficult things, though,

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:84%
because you have a
linear way to look at it,

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and then you have a
symbolic way to look at it.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.465 align:middle line:84%
And so the challenge
is to try to blend

00:21:00.465 --> 00:21:02.070 align:middle line:84%
those to find the
truth because I

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
do think that you have to
take both sides of that

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:90%
to understand it.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient cultures
were absolutely brilliant.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:84%
They were able to create
a symbol that represented

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.660 align:middle line:84%
an entire representation
of what they were trying

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.790 align:middle line:90%
to say in one single depiction.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And once you understand
what those depictions are,

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.855 align:middle line:84%
you can get a glimpse into what
really happened back long ago.

00:21:24.855 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us some examples,
Matt, of some of these symbols.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:90%
What could they be?

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, sure.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So, if someone was to
go to the hospital,

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.820 align:middle line:84%
or they see an
ambulance go by, you

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:90%
see that's the Rod of Asclepius.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
The rod with the
serpents wound around it.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the wings of
Hermes on the caduceus symbol.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:90%
These are ancient symbols.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But yet, today, the
serpent is considered

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.620 align:middle line:84%
demonized by a lot of religious
groups in modern academia.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't make any sense
if it's a symbol that

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:84%
represents health and higher
consciousness and ascension.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's a medical symbol.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That's right.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Whereas on the other side, you
see symbols like the eagle,

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.775 align:middle line:84%
as well, which I believe
have been completely inverted

00:22:02.775 --> 00:22:04.710 align:middle line:84%
to their opposite
representations.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:84%
The serpent always represented
knowledge and reaching

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
higher states of energy
and consciousness.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What about the symbols
of, like, the pine cone?

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah,
so the pine cone

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.235 align:middle line:84%
is another one of these
extremely important symbols

00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:84%
once you start looking at things
like the eagle in the serpent,

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and then you get into
things like the pine cone.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And what we find, George,
is that the pine cone

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:84%
has been shown in
these lost civilization

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.080 align:middle line:90%
locations around the world.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We find giant murals
with these pine cones

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:35.048 align:middle line:84%
being depicted in every
one of these locations,

00:22:35.048 --> 00:22:36.090 align:middle line:90%
nearly, around the world.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're always
shown the same way.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:84%
They hold the pine
cone in their hand,

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and they point it
towards someone.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Like it's some
object of some kind.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And what
I believe based

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:48.750 align:middle line:84%
on what I've studied on
what that pine cone means

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.715 align:middle line:84%
is the pine cone represents
the passing of knowledge.

00:22:51.715 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.548 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So, if you
were pointing a pine cone

00:22:54.548 --> 00:22:57.120 align:middle line:84%
at someone, it would be
you providing knowledge.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And I mean knowledge
of everything.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
knowledge of one area.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It is the totality
of all knowledge.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What about a handbag?

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.318 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So, the
handbag is another one

00:23:05.318 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:84%
of these mysterious symbols that
is always present, or almost

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
always present,
with the pine cone.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So, the way I try
to figure things out

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:84%
is, once you know what
one symbol is, it'll often

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.510 align:middle line:90%
have connections to the other.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So, in this case, the pine cone
was the passing of knowledge,

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and the handbag was
being held to their side.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
That was what that was
what this sacred pine

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:90%
cone was supposed to be inside.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:90%
They're both symbolic.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So, it would be where you
would carry the knowledge.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.697 align:middle line:84%
The totality of all the
knowledge would be the handbag,

00:23:33.697 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and then the pine cone would
be the passing of knowledge

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.095 align:middle line:90%
to those civilizations.

00:23:37.095 --> 00:23:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Where do you
find all these symbols?

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: You find them all
over the world, actually.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to sit down
and really study them, just do

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:84%
a little search for
pine cone and handbag,

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.210 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that they're
depicted in nearly every one

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:84%
of these regions
around the world where

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:84%
we find this mysterious
evidence of these more

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:84%
advanced buildings, and
more advanced building

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:84%
practices, and the
types of writings

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:84%
that tend to be
much more ancient

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.728 align:middle line:84%
and go back to the times when
we have this information that

00:24:02.728 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:90%
tells us about those mysteries.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are these
symbols etched on blocks

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:90%
of stone or anything like that?

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: They're
beautifully drawn.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the art in some
of these murals and stelas

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.730 align:middle line:90%
is truly incredible.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that I
find so fascinating about them,

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:84%
George, is you can
stare at them for hours

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:84%
because every single
little thing that was drawn

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.160 align:middle line:84%
has some kind of
a meaning to it.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of a symbolic meaning.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And so by understanding what
those murals and stelas say,

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:84%
what they're trying to depict,
even though you don't have,

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.920 align:middle line:84%
potentially, words
to go with it,

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.737 align:middle line:84%
you can understand a story based
on just what the depiction is

00:24:38.737 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:90%
trying to represent.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.112 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What would
you say, Matthew,

00:24:41.112 --> 00:24:44.190 align:middle line:84%
in your career is the
most bizarre symbol

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.652 align:middle line:90%
that you've come across so far?

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: The most
bizarre symbol?

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess early
on the swastika symbol

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:84%
was always a very strange symbol
because I grew up thinking, oh,

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:84%
this is an evil Nazi
symbol all my life.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that the swastika
was just an ancient symbol

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.185 align:middle line:84%
that cultures had
all around the world.

00:25:03.185 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: The Nazis made it evil.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exactly.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It wasn't
evil until then.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.115 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: They took it, and
they turned it into a symbol

00:25:08.115 --> 00:25:09.800 align:middle line:90%
to use for a very bad reason.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Whereas those
symbols were just all

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.510 align:middle line:84%
taken from much more
ancient cultures.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Interesting,
interesting.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Who were the symbol makers?

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, it seems
like all roads lead back

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:90%
to the Anunnaki.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:10%
Every time I do this research,
I feel like every time

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:10%
I want to look for influences
of other connections somewhere,

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:10%
it just seems to
always lead back

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.490 align:middle line:10%
to this group of
the Anunnaki, which

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:10%
I do believe maybe a group
of potentially beings

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:10%
from many different
places, not just one.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a term used to blanket
the entire group of--

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.562 align:middle line:84%
think about beings
that are not from here.

00:25:47.562 --> 00:25:49.520 align:middle line:84%
They're ascended beings
that are not from here.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.603 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, I think
Sitchin was on to something

00:25:51.603 --> 00:25:52.833 align:middle line:90%
with his theories, don't you?

00:25:52.833 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Absolutely.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:84%
As I said, Sitchin paved
the way for all of this,

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:84%
to understand what kind of
influences they had here

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and how they
influenced our story.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that our story goes
hand in hand with the Anunnaki.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think we
are, in many ways, them.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But a version that's much
different than it used to be.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There are
some experts who do not

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:90%
agree with Zecharia Sitchin.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:84%
They think his interpretation
of the Sumerian tablets

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.530 align:middle line:90%
are all screwed up and wrong.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: I have come to--
when I really looked at this

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.015 align:middle line:10%
and I came to say, I want to
know what this story really

00:26:27.015 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:10%
was, and I want to know if
Sitchin was telling the truth.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:84%
What I find that-- he did
make some really, really good

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.260 align:middle line:90%
points.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.490 align:middle line:84%
But there were some areas
that I did disagree with.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And that was where I began to
truly cross reference and study

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:84%
those tablets to try to
see what that story was.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.660 align:middle line:10%
And he definitely got us
the right direction on that.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:10%
There was just some minor areas
that I disagreed with, just

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:10%
in terms of what the
purposes of certain numbers

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.187 align:middle line:10%
or in certain origin stories
and things like that.

00:26:53.187 --> 00:26:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had the
honor of giving him

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:84%
a Lifetime Achievement Award at
one of the Conscious Life Expo

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:84%
events several years ago--
before he died, obviously.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And he's on stage, and
I'm giving him the award.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I didn't
know exactly how old he was.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Ended up being 90
years old when he died.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But I asked him, I said,
in front of this crowd,

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Sitchin, congratulations.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Here you are.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.320 align:middle line:90%
How old are you?

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And he turned to the
microphone and went,

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.450 align:middle line:90%
George, that's very rude.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.953 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
kind of guy he was.

00:27:25.953 --> 00:27:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But the work he did,
investigating the Anunnaki

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and piecing things
together, I thought,

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely fabulous.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
we don't know where

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:84%
we'd be right now with this
research if it wasn't for him.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.893 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: We think about it
where some of these experts

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:43.610 align:middle line:84%
have come and translated
these tablets.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But then they get buried
in some obscure book

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.800 align:middle line:84%
somewhere because they're not
considered the significance

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.330 align:middle line:90%
of what they really represent.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Because mainstream academia
is really handcuffed

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:84%
with how far they can go talking
about some of these topics.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: In your opinion, what
does the Anunnaki represent?

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: They represent the
keys to this entire story.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%
How civilizations came out of
being nomadic hunter-gatherers.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.370 align:middle line:84%
How all of the
knowledge of astronomy,

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:84%
mathematics, metallurgy,
agriculture, where

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.910 align:middle line:90%
everything originated from.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
someone's opinion.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerians come
out and clearly say.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:84%
That they state that all
of that was handed down

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.070 align:middle line:90%
from above to them.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Not that they
discovered it somehow.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How could they make
that up if it didn't happen?

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exactly.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And how could the Sumerians
have detailed accounts

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.428 align:middle line:84%
of where all the planets
are and their ratios

00:28:38.428 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:90%
without the use of a telescope?

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.553 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:28:40.553 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:84%
There are some tablets that
depict the solar system.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't tell
without a telescope.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.450 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have that
kind of equipment.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: That's right.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.513 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Somebody
told them something.

00:28:50.513 --> 00:28:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That cylinder
seal is called VA243,

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and it depicts an
exact representation

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system,
thousands of years

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:84%
before the first
telescope was invented.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you explain this?

00:29:01.435 --> 00:29:02.852 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: To me,
it would just be

00:29:02.852 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that had to have
been provided to them.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Either that, or they had
some ability later on

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.080 align:middle line:90%
if you view the heavens.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:90%
We don't really fully know.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But where'd it go?

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
that's the mystery.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.157 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If they had a
telescope, where is it?

00:29:15.157 --> 00:29:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's the point,
just like the tools being gone.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Same thing.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: We don't know.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.763 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
I will point out

00:29:20.763 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:84%
is that some of these
time periods that I've

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:84%
tried to lay down and
some of the timeline

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:84%
work that I've done
based on those tablets

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.900 align:middle line:84%
would put some of the early
groups of the Sumerians much,

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:90%
much older than we're told.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If the
Anunnaki seeded us,

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.290 align:middle line:84%
do you think they are the ones
who continue to come back,

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.540 align:middle line:84%
all these UFO
reports that we get?

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're just checking
up on their farm?

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, I think
that's a really good question.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, though,
when you look at other texts.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.970 align:middle line:84%
You look at ancient Hebrew
texts, like the Book of Enoch.

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:84%
You look at ancient Vedic texts,
the Bhagavad Gita and others,

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.750 align:middle line:84%
they keep mentioning these
groups that watch us.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:90%
That just watch us from beyond.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Sumerian tablets,
they call them the Igigi,

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.390 align:middle line:84%
whereas these other writings
they call them the Watchers.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.145 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to
be associated with,

00:30:07.145 --> 00:30:09.530 align:middle line:84%
like you mentioned,
some kind of beings

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:10.760 align:middle line:90%
that seem to be watching.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Just observing how
things are going here.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How did we do?

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
probably thinking.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, like how is
human civilization doing now,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.120 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Maybe the
next experiment,

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.748 align:middle line:84%
we'll make them a
little different.

00:30:22.748 --> 00:30:23.748 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, I know.

00:30:23.748 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully there won't
be an experiment, right?

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.150 align:middle line:84%
We've got another last tablet
I want to look at and have

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:90%
you interpret it for us.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.218 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:30:33.218 --> 00:30:34.760 align:middle line:84%
What are we looking
at here, Matthew?

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: OK, so this is one
of my favorite tablets of all.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.720 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
Legend of Etana.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, right there, you get the
name "Legend," which makes it--

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm going to let
you read this one for us.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And it
makes it seem like it's

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.718 align:middle line:90%
a legend, like it's not real.

00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But the more I study
this, it goes along

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:84%
with the same comparisons
of the same information.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.700 align:middle line:10%
So, it says, "They
planned a city.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:10%
The gods laid its foundations.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.960 align:middle line:10%
They planned the city of Kish.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.880 align:middle line:10%
The Igigi founded its brickwork.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.400 align:middle line:10%
Let him be there, the
people's shepherd.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:10%
Let Etana be their architect.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:08.580 align:middle line:10%
The great Anunnaki gods,
ordainers of destinies,

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:10%
sat taking their counsel
concerning the land.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.950 align:middle line:10%
The creators of
the four regions,

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:10%
establishers of
all physical form."

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.278 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now,
interpret that for us.

00:31:18.278 --> 00:31:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: This is
brilliant to me, George,

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
because what it does is,
when we read the other two

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.860 align:middle line:84%
tablets, the Sumerian King
List and Eridu Genesis,

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.190 align:middle line:84%
it mentioned how Suruppak was
the last city before the flood.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But this tablet mentions how
Kish was the first city created

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:33.570 align:middle line:90%
after the flood.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: After the flood.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exactly.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And we know that because
the Sumerian King

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:39.765 align:middle line:84%
List mentions that in the
separate set of writings.

00:31:39.765 --> 00:31:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, I thought the
flood wiped out civilization.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.473 align:middle line:84%
So, who is the one who would
have created this new city?

00:31:45.473 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
that's the thing.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:47.940 align:middle line:90%
There were survivors.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.650 align:middle line:84%
There were individuals
that did survive.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And there were certain
bloodline kings

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:84%
that carried on those
traits like before.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.895 align:middle line:84%
And Etana was one of
those bloodline kings.

00:31:56.895 --> 00:31:58.710 align:middle line:84%
When I read that
quote, it wasn't

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:84%
that he just became King because
he happened to be powerful

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.100 align:middle line:90%
and lived there.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.860 align:middle line:84%
He was chosen to become
King, very specifically.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do they
make mention of Noah

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:90%
in anything that you've seen?

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Absolutely.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Another tablet,
called the Atra-hasis,

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:14.110 align:middle line:84%
is the original story of what we
think of as the biblical story

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.910 align:middle line:90%
of Noah.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.330 align:middle line:84%
But that name was a religious
name that was used later.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:22.110 align:middle line:84%
His original name was
either Atra-hasis, Ziusudra,

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.880 align:middle line:90%
or Utnapishtim.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The Anunnaki themselves
had a tremendous influence

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:90%
on our past.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.390 align:middle line:90%
What about our present?

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's
the big question

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.730 align:middle line:84%
besides when the next cataclysm
is going to come, I think,

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
is that are they still
influencing our reality here.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Are we still under
their control?

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult to
understand whether or not,

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.148 align:middle line:84%
when we look at the control
systems that exist here,

00:32:46.148 --> 00:32:48.690 align:middle line:84%
keeping consciousness suppressed
and all the different things

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:50.880 align:middle line:84%
that happen, whether
or not that's just

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.640 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of powerful,
elite secret societies,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.580 align:middle line:84%
or if it is still under the
umbrella of the Anunnaki.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.410 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you were
speaking before a group

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.870 align:middle line:84%
of archeological experts
and you were showing

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.398 align:middle line:84%
them slides of the Anunnaki
and things like that,

00:33:06.398 --> 00:33:07.440 align:middle line:90%
what would you tell them?

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.360 align:middle line:90%
What would your theme be?

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I would
discuss with them

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:16.350 align:middle line:84%
how could we have these detailed
conversations between them,

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:19.020 align:middle line:84%
discussing mankind and
wanting to wipe them out,

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and how they felt bad after-- if
they're simply just this myth,

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's symbolic,
and they're not real?

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:28.123 align:middle line:84%
There's so much evidence to
prove that there was very, very

00:33:28.123 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:84%
tangible influences that came
from somewhere because think

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge just can't
come from nowhere.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.530 align:middle line:90%
It has to come from somewhere.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's got to
originate from something.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exactly.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, if a lot
of the mainstream

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:41.880 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to acknowledge that
the Anunnaki are real deities

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.800 align:middle line:84%
or beings, they just
want to act like it's

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a force
of nature or something,

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the planets
or something like that.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But really, I
think that they are

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.200 align:middle line:90%
the keys to the entire story.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I would sit back
in the crowd if it were me,

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and I would raise my
hand and go, Mr. LaCroix,

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.050 align:middle line:90%
were they extraterrestrial?

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:02.117 align:middle line:90%
Did they come here?

00:34:02.117 --> 00:34:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It definitely
seems that they came here

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.220 align:middle line:90%
from somewhere.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.470 align:middle line:90%
But the big question is where.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And we find bits and pieces
of evidence here and there.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.502 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
really neat ancient text

00:34:12.502 --> 00:34:14.502 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people
aren't familiar with called

00:34:14.502 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:84%
the Kolbrin Bible
that was actually--

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, I've
heard of that.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: In Egyptian
and Celtic writing.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.668 align:middle line:90%
And it actually talks about--

00:34:19.668 --> 00:34:20.585 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:34:20.585 --> 00:34:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, and it mentions
that these creators that

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:84%
created this place
here for mankind,

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:84%
they came from
somewhere far, far away.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.219 align:middle line:90%
Not of this realm.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think God the
Bible, angels of the Bible,

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.239 align:middle line:90%
were extraterrestrial?

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think it's all
just the same Anunnaki story.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I think the angels
and demons, it's

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:44.730 align:middle line:84%
just a way to show the different
roles that they played.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:46.420 align:middle line:90%
I think it's all the same thing.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One thing for sure.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Something absolutely spectacular
happened on this planet

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.830 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.975 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we're still
seeking out these answers.

00:34:58.975 --> 00:35:00.558 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I feel
like the rabbit hole

00:35:00.558 --> 00:35:03.180 align:middle line:84%
is going to just continue to
go deeper and deeper because I

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.600 align:middle line:84%
want to point out that those
tablets that we just read,

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.120 align:middle line:84%
all of those came from
the same ancient library

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.830 align:middle line:90%
called the Ashurbanipal Library.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And when that was uncovered in
1849 by Austen Henry Layard,

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.960 align:middle line:84%
they found thousands
of cuneiform tablets.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Thousands.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.870 align:middle line:90%
And today, George?

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Less than 200 have been
translated by modern academics.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's astounding.

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.988 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: They're sitting in
a dusty back room somewhere.

00:35:26.988 --> 00:35:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But they're
there somewhere.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: They're
there somewhere.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They haven't been
destroyed, altered, smashed.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Whether
or not they're all

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.950 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Oxford or some of them

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:36.570 align:middle line:84%
are kept down in the
Vatican archives,

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:39.570 align:middle line:84%
we don't know because,
as a society that

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:84%
are seeking these answers, being
outside of modern academia,

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.863 align:middle line:84%
we don't have access
to all of these.

00:35:44.863 --> 00:35:46.530 align:middle line:84%
We just have access
to what we're given.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Matt, why
is it so important

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.747 align:middle line:90%
that we get these answers?

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Because
if you want to know

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.940 align:middle line:84%
the true story of something,
you have to go back

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.470 align:middle line:90%
to the earliest form of it.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.012 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
things like the Old

00:35:57.012 --> 00:35:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and the New Testament,
what we find

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
is that it's just
being rewritten

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:01.670 align:middle line:90%
from previous stories.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So, I wanted to
find answers, and I

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.780 align:middle line:84%
realized that the
only way to find those

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.490 align:middle line:84%
was to go back to
the pure source.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
cuneiform writing is.

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It is the oldest form of writing
that exists on the planet.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And we know that,
because anything

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that would be paper records
or anything else that's

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.760 align:middle line:84%
not in a clay tablet wouldn't
have survived till today.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: These
tablets that were made

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.690 align:middle line:84%
we're done approximately
how long after the events

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.808 align:middle line:90%
that they talk about?

00:36:28.808 --> 00:36:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: We find that
some of the tablets

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.520 align:middle line:84%
were rewritten from an earlier
story and then carried on.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.690 align:middle line:90%
But many of those tablets--

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:35.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: So hundreds of years?

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of years?

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Thousands of years.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.790 align:middle line:84%
We can trace most
of those tablets

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.640 align:middle line:90%
to well beyond 12,000 years ago.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.505 align:middle line:90%
That's astounding.

00:36:44.505 --> 00:36:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I know, to think
that a message like that

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:46.500 align:middle line:90%
could be preserved.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.515 align:middle line:84%
But that's the brilliance
behind these cultures.

00:36:48.515 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think the
writers of the tablets

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:55.860 align:middle line:84%
are just as baffled and were
just as baffled as we are

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I actually think
they had a lot more answers

00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.340 align:middle line:90%
than we have today.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.965 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What if they
made this all up?

00:37:00.965 --> 00:37:03.570 align:middle line:84%
What if it's just a
story, a great book?

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
that's the thing

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.950 align:middle line:84%
that I've obviously pondered
and wondered myself because I'm

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.030 align:middle line:90%
an objective person.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.700 align:middle line:84%
But the more you look at
what they state, and then you

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.090 align:middle line:84%
find those ancient
ruins of those cities

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:84%
in the locations they mention,
it all becomes very real.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to
consider Eridu a myth.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But then, when you
find it in the desert--

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You find
something, that's right.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.273 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, and then
it's being deliberately hidden

00:37:26.273 --> 00:37:28.110 align:middle line:90%
and suppressed, you say, aha.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.793 align:middle line:90%
So, this really is significant.

00:37:29.793 --> 00:37:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What do you
think Saddam Hussein knew

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:32.460 align:middle line:90%
before he got killed?

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.002 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Saddam
Hussein is a very--

00:37:34.002 --> 00:37:35.940 align:middle line:84%
he was a character
that definitely knew

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:90%
about his ancient past in Iraq.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I think a later ruler,
a later individual who

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
was President of Iraq,
it came later, actually

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.270 align:middle line:84%
mentioned some of
those ancient stargates

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and some of those ancient
archeological sites in Iraq

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:90%
out of being proud.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that Saddam did
know a lot of great secrets.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He played his cards
wrong, though, didn't he?

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.443 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, I mean,
look what happened.

00:38:01.443 --> 00:38:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Not to justify his
actions, saying

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.352 align:middle line:90%
he was a great man or anything.

00:38:04.352 --> 00:38:06.790 align:middle line:84%
But look at what happened
after he was wiped out.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Now all those sites
are under civil war

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and we can't even
get access to them.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or destroyed,
in some cases.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Exactly,
or destroyed.

00:38:12.625 --> 00:38:15.450 align:middle line:84%
The gates of Nineveh, which
is the front gate where

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:17.340 align:middle line:84%
the Ashurbanipal
Library, the greatest

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.770 align:middle line:84%
mass of cuneiform tablets
in the world, that gate

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:22.440 align:middle line:90%
was destroyed by ISIS.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you could get
one major question answered

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that you've been seeking,
what would that be?

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.150 align:middle line:90%
What would that question be?

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.525 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think
I would really

00:38:31.525 --> 00:38:33.420 align:middle line:84%
like to know where the
Anunnaki came from,

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.840 align:middle line:90%
or maybe when they came from.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Uh-huh.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.280 align:middle line:84%
What about Sitchin saying they
came from this extra planet

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.170 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system?

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.840 align:middle line:84%
That you don't seem to
be jumping for joy with.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, the
thing is, though,

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.610 align:middle line:84%
even if I don't necessarily
agree with them coming from

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
there, there definitely is
another planet that exists out

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.350 align:middle line:90%
beyond our--

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's out
there somewhere.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Oh, there
is definitely a planet.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.003 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
areas that I've done

00:38:56.003 --> 00:38:57.300 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit of research to.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Things like the Pioneer 10
probe and others have found.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.670 align:middle line:84%
There are secrets beyond
our inner solar system

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.438 align:middle line:90%
that are very, very interesting.

00:39:05.438 --> 00:39:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, for
Sitchin to make this--

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:08.970 align:middle line:90%
and we go back to him again--

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.820 align:middle line:84%
to make this
incredible assertation,

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:16.620 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki came from this
extra planet, is remarkable.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But he claims he interpreted
that from the Sumerian tablets.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: It does mention it.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.040 align:middle line:90%
It calls it Nibiru.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.737 align:middle line:84%
And the way you want
to translate it is you

00:39:25.737 --> 00:39:27.570 align:middle line:84%
can either consider it
some kind of a planet

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:28.950 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of a temple.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.867 align:middle line:90%
We don't fully know.

00:39:30.867 --> 00:39:32.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
things to bring up

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.860 align:middle line:84%
is that Sumerian
is a dead language.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Sumerian cuneiform died
out thousands of years ago.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, when Austen Henry Layard
first uncovered those tablets,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.850 align:middle line:84%
it took over 20 years
before the first person,

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:49.200 align:middle line:84%
George Smith in 1875, actually
could translate the first one.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a dead language
for thousands of years.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: This interpretation,
is it just Sitchin's?

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:56.988 align:middle line:90%
Or is he backed up by these?

00:39:56.988 --> 00:39:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, that was
what I really wanted to know.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to actually
understand who the best

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.390 align:middle line:90%
translators in the world was.

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Because Sitchin was good at
understanding and interpreting

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:84%
things, but he wasn't
an expert Assyriologist.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.630 align:middle line:84%
George Smith, who I
mentioned was the first one

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.730 align:middle line:84%
to actually translate
a cuneiform tablet,

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and he had studied
ancient Assyrian cultures

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.140 align:middle line:84%
for four years and
years and years.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And it took over 20 years,
but he finally-- in 1875,

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.740 align:middle line:84%
he translated the first
tablet ever in human-- well,

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:29.680 align:middle line:84%
in our human history, I should
say, in the last 5,000 years.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And he translated--
the Epic of Gilgamesh

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:84%
was the first tablet
to ever be translated.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.835 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You've got a
passion for this, Matt.

00:40:35.835 --> 00:40:37.140 align:middle line:90%
What drives you?

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I love
ancient mysteries.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I have this deep
connection to our past

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.860 align:middle line:84%
being much more complex
than we've been told.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.860 align:middle line:10%
And that journey of
discovering that truth

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.410 align:middle line:10%
has been the core of
my drive to do this.

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:52.080 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What's
your next project?

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.110 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: Actually, right now,
I'm co-writing my third book

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.730 align:middle line:10%
with Billy Carson where we--

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:10%
we're calling it
the Epic of Humanity

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.160 align:middle line:10%
because using tablets and
everything from Vedic text

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.410 align:middle line:10%
to cuneiform text to
ancient Hebrew texts

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:07.080 align:middle line:10%
to Aztec and Maya text,
we want to understand

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.770 align:middle line:10%
what's the story of our
story from what they say

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:13.663 align:middle line:10%
and what the evidence says,
not what modern academia says.

00:41:13.663 --> 00:41:14.580 align:middle line:90%

Where did they go?

Where were their tools?

Where were the artifacts?

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Will we ever know?

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, one day.
