00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC] And
I think many people today

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.888 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to
believe anymore.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>People are basically
going to keep on

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.650 align:middle line:84%
to help uncover what
really happened.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>I felt like something
was watching me.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>We weren't given
all the information.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.220 align:middle line:84%
We weren't told
the entire story.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.612 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.612 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE NOORY: And
welcome to "Beyond Belief."

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:10%
Now, in our previous episode
with Amelia Kinkade, the animal

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:10%
communicator, we
talked about some

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:10%
of the various aspects
of communication

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.999 align:middle line:10%
and what she did for
animals to make them happy.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to
talk a little bit more

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.310 align:middle line:84%
about that in this
addition of the program.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Plus another little
surprise for you.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.437 align:middle line:90%
Amelia, welcome back.

00:00:48.437 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AMELIA KINKADE: Hi, thank you.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.627 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I just
love what you do.

00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Thank you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.501 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's exciting.

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:84%
You know I've owned
horses, I've owned dogs.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I've never been a cat
person, but I like cats.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:90%
They're wonderful animals.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:90%
They do, they look at you.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:90%
They know something.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:90%
They sense something.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.375 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well, we
are an animal, George.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't
like to admit that.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:90%
We're one of five kinds of--

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: We are.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: --great apes.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And we may be on
the lower echelon, you know?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: We don't
want to admit that.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:10%
Most people don't
want to admit that,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:10%
but it is absolutely true.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.160 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we are one of
trillions of species

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.930 align:middle line:10%
of living beings on this planet.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: What a planet, too.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: And if a new paradigm
presents itself and allows us

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.300 align:middle line:10%
to understand that the
consciousness is the same,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.357 align:middle line:10%
the consciousness of
the Creator is in-

00:01:41.357 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.523 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: --every living being.

00:01:43.523 --> 00:01:44.570 align:middle line:90%
It's in every flower.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:90%
It's in every tree.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:90%
It's in every waterfall.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, I think
there's more God in your dog

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.635 align:middle line:84%
than there is anywhere
else in this universe.

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It kind
of makes you wonder

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.450 align:middle line:84%
if you should swipe at a
mosquito next time or something

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:84%
like that, because I really
do when I listen to you.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And you hear about the
intelligence of the animal

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and its ability to
communicate, whether it's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
in the form of an animal
or an insect, right?

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Right.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm saying
to myself, my God,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I used to step on ants
when I was a little boy.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Did they look up at
me and go, oh, no, no,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:90%
don't do that to me.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, thinking about that
makes you feel horrible.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well, connecting to
the animals in the world around

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.532 align:middle line:90%
you makes you feel great.

00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I've let 'em go now.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And maybe now
you can rescue some ants--

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.291 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I try to let go.

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: --so you
can have an ant farm.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And if we focus on what we can
do, not on what we can't do,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
then we can change
the world around us.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:84%
But the first step
is learning how

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with other
animals on this planet,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.402 align:middle line:84%
because, ultimately,
they are our teachers.

00:02:58.402 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Can we--

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.568 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: We can't
learn from them

00:03:00.568 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:90%
if we can't even hear them.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I agree.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:90%
But how can we do that?

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Do we have to be
trained to do that?

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: You can learn.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.122 align:middle line:90%
I now have five books out.

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do you teach people?

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I teach people
all over the world.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So I've got Level One
is my training program.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Colorado, Vancouver, I'm
speaking in Portland, and then

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.609 align:middle line:90%
in London, Switzerland, Africa--

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.394 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: --Canada, Mexico--

00:03:29.394 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You are
all over the map.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I've taught
in Austria, Norway.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's just reaching.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.070 align:middle line:84%
We are now creating
a web of light

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.726 align:middle line:84%
that's wrapping
around the world.

00:03:40.726 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do
you know, Amelia,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that you have connected
with that animal?

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:84%
How do you know that
you've finally did that?

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.129 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: You know
you've connected

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:84%
if they respond to you
in a different way,

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.299 align:middle line:84%
or if you get information
that is undeniably correct.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:84%
You pick up on
something that there's

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.165 align:middle line:84%
no way you could have known
and somebody confirms it.

00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:84%
If I say, this dog is telling
me that his favorite person

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
is a five-year-old
little girl named Olivia.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.545 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh, my God, my
granddaughter was just here.

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:12.420 align:middle line:90%
She's five years old.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Olivia.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Done.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Skepticism no more.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Exactly.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And that's
available to everybody.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.907 align:middle line:90%
We all have this.

00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:90%
It's this brain chemistry.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And the animal
changes, his attitude changes

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.679 align:middle line:90%
when this happens.

00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well, they now get
to live with human beings that

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
are conscious and
aware, and loving, that

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
are having collaborative
relationships with them.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So I don't teach people
how to make animals

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:90%
do what people want.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I teach people how to hear
what the animals want.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But there's reciprocity
there, the animal and human.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:90%
They listen to each other.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: If you give
them what they want,

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
they're going to do what you
want, because they love you.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Not because they have
to, because they want to.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And animals are
doing that already.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.315 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at
the healing properties

00:05:04.315 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
that animals have on human
beings, it's incredible.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, it is.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: It's incredible.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I was just in South
Africa and I was

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.480 align:middle line:84%
working with a charity
called Shumbashaba.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And the woman who coordinated
the event, who does my South

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Africa workshops, brought
me the Lipizzaner stallions.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They are best.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And she
created a charity event

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:84%
with the poorest black African
children in South Africa.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And the children are emotionally
and physically disabled.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:10%
She had one
2-year-old little boy

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:10%
that couldn't hold his
head up and had never

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.855 align:middle line:10%
sat up in his life.

00:05:39.855 --> 00:05:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh my!

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: She put him
on the back of a horse.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.987 align:middle line:84%
And this two-year-old
sat up like--

00:05:45.987 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Changed his life.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: --a star.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:90%
But the horse healed the kid.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And animals are
healing us and trying

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.230 align:middle line:90%
to heal the whole human race.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was
a story that I just

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:84%
had on Coast to
Coast of a swimmer

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:84%
out there in the United
Kingdom who was swimming.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And he was approached
by a shark.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:84%
a school of dolphins
surrounded him and would not

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.925 align:middle line:90%
leave his side.

00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Wow.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.174 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The shark
couldn't get to him.

00:06:20.174 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And after the shark
swam away, the dolphins

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.225 align:middle line:84%
stayed with the swimmer until
he got to his destination.

00:06:28.225 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Oh, is
that beautiful.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Amazing.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.480 align:middle line:90%
How do they know this?

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well, dolphins
will come when you call them.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:90%
They already have sonar.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:90%
They're already "online."

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're already there.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: They're
online with the universe.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my shark story
here, which people

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:84%
also can see on my
website, was based

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
around a story that happened
a few years ago, when

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.502 align:middle line:90%
I was in North Hollywood.

00:06:51.502 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And I get an email,
because, now, I

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.320 align:middle line:84%
do charity work with
animals all over the world.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And a woman named Lesley Rochat
emailed me from South Africa

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.020 align:middle line:84%
and said, I'm doing
shark conservation work.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me?

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't know
what I could possibly do.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I got online and I see
her on a YouTube video,

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.577 align:middle line:84%
where she's underwater
holding the fin

00:07:11.577 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Of a shark.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: --of a great
white shark, swimming along.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And I burst into tears.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.273 align:middle line:84%
I emailed her and I said,
I don't know what I can do,

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.295 align:middle line:84%
I'll do anything I
can do to help you.

00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That you're not doing.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.988 align:middle line:84%
You know, she's already
doing something, right?

00:07:23.988 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Right.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:84%
As I'm sitting
there at my office,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I see a huge white
grandmother shark.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's got with her
a dark teenage boy.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, my goodness.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, these animals
think in pictures.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Animals are already in
communication with each other.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.132 align:middle line:84%
There's already an
entire internet system--

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Network,
there's a network out--

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: --out there
in the zero-point field

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that we have disconnected
ourselves from.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So I teach people how
to get connected again.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right, get back online.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: I kept seeing this.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:84%
When I flew to South Africa,
and we went up to dive

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:84%
with these sharks north of Cape
Town, they were telling me,

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Lesley was telling
me what the female

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:90%
can't be with a teenage boy.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.816 align:middle line:90%
They are not--

00:08:12.816 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Compatible?

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.336 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: No, they
don't stay together.

00:08:15.336 --> 00:08:16.600 align:middle line:90%
They're solitary hunters.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And I kept seeing a whole pod
of them in a family group.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said, they're
all together.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:90%
They're living in a colony.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:90%
She said, that is not true.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
That is not what we know
to be true about sharks.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, the big white
female said, I'm coming,

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to meet you.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.474 align:middle line:84%
And the first boat came
back, no shark sightings.

00:08:34.474 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:84%
People had flown in from
all over the country.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:90%
They were just devastated.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:90%
All over the world.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:84%
Another boat came back,
another boat came back.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And Lesley said to me, listen,
this is really bad news,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
but there are no
shark sightings.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the wrong time of year.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.450 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to come.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.111 align:middle line:84%
And I kept hearing her
saying, I'm coming.

00:08:53.111 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm on the way.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: I'm coming.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:90%
And I'm bringing a teenage boy.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So I went out on the boat with
a bunch of skeptical South

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:84%
African jocks who see the little
dogie psychic from Hollywood

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:90%
calling the sharks.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.339 align:middle line:84%
And the first teenage
female shows up.

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Out of nowhere, right?

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Then another
teenage female shows up.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Then another teenage
female shows up.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, the boat's in
total pandemonium.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the teenage
boy shows up.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the ocean went
completely silent for an hour.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.952 align:middle line:84%
And the woman who
runs the company

00:09:27.952 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:84%
said, Amelia, we've
got to go back.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.282 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, we're not
going back, she's coming.

00:09:32.282 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:90%
She's coming.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And then in the distance
this fin appears.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And there she is.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a big shark.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And she
took a meeting with me.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:84%
She was the old
grandma matriarch.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:84%
They hadn't seen
her in over a year.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And what I haven't
said on my site,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.030 align:middle line:84%
what everybody asked me is
what did she say to you?

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.771 align:middle line:84%
Well, she called me,
I didn't call her.

00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She being that shark.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I took
the meeting with her.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
She said, when you can teach
your people how to communicate

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
with animals and you
teach your children how

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:84%
to talk to our
children, there might

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.990 align:middle line:90%
be some hope for the human race.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:90%
That's what she said.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.985 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would they
promise not to eat us?

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: We don't
taste good, George.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the only reason
that humans still exist.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Why do they bite?

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Why do they attack?

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.891 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Oh, maybe
one's a little senile,

00:10:23.891 --> 00:10:26.852 align:middle line:84%
or he doesn't see so good,
takes a bite out of a surfer--

00:10:26.852 --> 00:10:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, would
you be reluctant to jump

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:29.768 align:middle line:90%
in the water with that?

00:10:29.768 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I did jump
in the water with that.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Are you crazy?

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I was in the
cage, but she came to see me.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.419 align:middle line:90%
And I said I love you.

00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Were you scared?

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And she
said, I love you.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And here we are-- an
ambassador from their species

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
came to talk to an
ambassador from our species.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.242 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: My gosh.

00:10:49.242 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back and look at
some of these other animals

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.470 align:middle line:90%
that you've dealt with.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.456 align:middle line:84%
There was a cat that you had
some kind of experience with.

00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:56.956 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:59.366 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Oh, I love.

00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:90%
This is my latest client.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Sweet Pea.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I was emailed this
picture of Sweet Pea.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Sweet Pea lives at the
marina in Los Angeles.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:84%
I tuned into Sweat Pea not
knowing where she lived.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.054 align:middle line:84%
And I kept seeing these
monsters flying through the air.

00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem with
the cat, the owner

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:84%
said, she hides under the
bed and she won't come out.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing these pterodactyls,
making these terrible noises,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:84%
looking like dragons,
flying through the air.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh
my goodness, if this

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.530 align:middle line:84%
is a demonic possession,
this is the worst

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen in my life.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And she said there are these
horrible monsters in the air.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I got
to their home, it's

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:90%
a glass highrise in the marina.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And the pterodactyls
just are pelicans.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.219 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: All right, to
her, they're pterodactyls.

00:11:53.219 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: They're scary.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:54.843 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:11:54.843 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: They're
bigger than cats.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.002 align:middle line:84%
And they're flying through the
air, making these awful noises.

00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I said to her, what does
your mother do for a living?

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:90%
She said, she makes dresses.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.492 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, that's
not really right.

00:12:07.492 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said what
does she really do?

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
She works on the
computer all day.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.500 align:middle line:90%
But she makes dresses.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.061 align:middle line:84%
And she was putting the
dresses on sheets on the bed.

00:12:15.061 --> 00:12:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha, laying them out.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: On the bed.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.469 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, what
the hell is this?

00:12:18.469 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to the
woman's home and I said,

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.092 align:middle line:84%
I know you work on
the computer all day.

00:12:24.092 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I come to find out
she's a stock trader.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, day trader.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Exactly.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But what are the dresses that
the cat keeps showing me?

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:84%
She said, there's
a new project where

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
we're developing a new
kind of hospital gown

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:90%
that's completely--

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she is to make it.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: --and new sheets
that they're going to

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
put on all of the beds in all
of the hospitals in America.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And they have
antibiotic properties.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And the cat saw this?

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: The cat knew what
the mother does for a living.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They thought
they were dresses.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.191 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well, they
are dresses in a way.

00:12:59.191 --> 00:13:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's cute.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's
look at some more

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.970 align:middle line:90%
of these incredible animals.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.065 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the elephant.

00:13:06.065 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: This was
the Elephant Nature

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Foundation in Chiang Mai.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I flew to this place
to speak to these elephants,

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.140 align:middle line:84%
this elephant was
standing on three legs.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:90%
She had stepped on land mine.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And she was completely
fine, brave.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But people had flown in
to do healing work on her.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was the other
leg gone or just damaged?

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: It was damaged.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:40.581 align:middle line:84%
And I went in to comfort her
and see how she's feeling,

00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and see if there's
anything we could

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:90%
do to make her feel better.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Lek Chailert, who runs this
place, the Elephant Nature

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, is the first woman
to ever train an elephant

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
with nothing but
love and kindness.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That elephant
looks content with you.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.755 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Yeah.

00:13:55.755 --> 00:13:57.592 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You could tell.

00:13:57.592 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I was very
content with her.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have another
picture of a cheetah.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about this story.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: The cheetah
is from Cheetah Outreach

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:90%
in Cape Town, South Africa.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I was brought in to talk
to a depressed cheetah.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:90%
And his name was Joseph.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Joseph, the
depressed cheetah?

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Exactly.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that happens,

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:84%
George, is that
people can't tell

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:84%
the difference between a medical
problem or a emotional problem,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
because grieving might have
the same symptoms as stomach

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.443 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:14:33.443 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I mean, you're
going do say, my dog won't eat,

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:90%
my horse won't eat.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.560 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Something's happened.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.965 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Maybe
they're grieving

00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:90%
the loss of their mate.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.657 align:middle line:84%
And the people think
that it's a back problem.

00:14:45.657 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:84%
They're going to run
all these X-rays,

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
run up a vet bill

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:84%
without taking the
time to say show me.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Let me see what you see.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.545 align:middle line:90%
Let me feel what you feel.

00:14:57.545 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to meet this
cheetah, I said what's wrong?

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.330 align:middle line:84%
I get hit with a
wave of sadness.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, that that's how I know it's
emotional, instead of physical.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:90%
He gave me the name Charlie.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:90%
He said, I miss Charlie.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:90%
I said, where's Charlie.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.860 align:middle line:84%
He said that they
sent Charlie up north.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Come to find out
Charlie was his mate,

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and they sent Charlie to
another breading facility

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.730 align:middle line:90%
to breed with other cheetah--

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.188 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
traumatic for them.

00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: --because they're
all genetically coded,

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:10%
so that they know exactly what
kind of genes they're getting,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:10%
which is not a bad thing.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.430 align:middle line:84%
But we're not acknowledging
that these animals have feelings

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.736 align:middle line:90%
and they have relationships.

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: That's
the key, I think.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.770 align:middle line:84%
You understand that feeling,
and they know you do.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
helps open that up.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come
back in just a moment.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.340 align:middle line:84%
More with "Beyond Belief"
and Amelia Kinkade.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And you have no idea what we
have in store for you next.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, welcome back.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I told you we had a surprise
here on "Beyond Belief."

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
We have here for you
a little tortoise.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And Amelia Kinkade, the
animal communicator,

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
will try to chat
with this thing.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have no
idea what hang-ups

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.647 align:middle line:90%
this little tortoise has, do we?

00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: No.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm meeting her
for the first time.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We have no
idea how old she is.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.716 align:middle line:90%
They used to have rings like--

00:16:27.716 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Did
you ask permission

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.475 align:middle line:84%
to turn her over and
look at her belly?

00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:33.951 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, that's kind of
forward on my part, isn't it?

00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I would
say, I would say so.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I'm going to give
your viewers a little crash

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:84%
course and you a very
quick miniature lesson in

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.427 align:middle line:90%
how this works.

00:16:43.427 --> 00:16:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: OK.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.998 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: So let's
say that you're

00:16:45.998 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
going to connect
with another animal,

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:90%
no matter what that animal is.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
My instructions are to bring
your attention out of your head

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.589 align:middle line:84%
and into a lower
part of your body.

00:16:56.589 --> 00:16:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to pretend that
your brain is like a computer.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.055 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: You
can reach up there

00:17:01.055 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:90%
and you can switch it off.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, the programs that
you would normally run

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.920 align:middle line:90%
are now turned off.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So the kinds of
rational questions,

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:90%
all your thoughts are gone.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Moving into a lower
part of your body.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.530 align:middle line:84%
We're stepping behind
our emotional self.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:84%
So now, there's
absolutely no emotion.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
bring, you're not

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:84%
going to bring your own opinion,
your own ego, your own thought,

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.830 align:middle line:90%
your own emotion.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:84%
You are now sitting in this
anchor of light in your spine

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and sending nothing
out but starlight,

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.480 align:middle line:84%
beams of starlight
from your heart.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.360 align:middle line:90%
So your focus is in your spirit.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that
animal's going to feel

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:84%
is this peace, this confidence,
this joy, this love,

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:90%
this compassion.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting in silence
with all your love.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He seems to be
getting a little bolder.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Look at
how she's looking.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And to imagine that you
could form a bridge.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is how we get online.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.510 align:middle line:84%
You want to get
their email, which

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:84%
means you want to resonate
on their frequency.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.355 align:middle line:90%
You are no longer you.

00:18:13.355 --> 00:18:16.610 align:middle line:90%
You are now this tortoise.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.920 align:middle line:84%
By pretending that you could
move your consciousness

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
into her body,
you're actually going

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
to be able to form a
bridge, where there's now

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.346 align:middle line:84%
an energetic communication
between the two of you.

00:18:29.346 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you can pretend
that you were her

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.930 align:middle line:84%
and if you were to
ask her a question,

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.700 align:middle line:84%
you would send out a different
frequency, because fear is not

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:84%
going to have the same
frequency as love.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:84%
If you were going
to ask her, are you

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.849 align:middle line:84%
in love with another tortoise,
ask her if she has a mate.

00:18:49.849 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You want
me to ask her that?

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.117 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Yeah.

00:18:52.117 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: By thinking that?

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I want you to
picture that you're in her body,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:84%
that you're at home in her
enclosure, whatever that is,

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking around to
see if there's another tortoise.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.482 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I don't see any there.

00:19:04.482 --> 00:19:05.898 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: You
think she's single?

00:19:05.898 --> 00:19:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: She is a single lady.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree with that.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to
look around and hold

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:90%
your focus in her body--

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.195 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Her head's coming up.

00:19:17.195 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: --is she lonely?

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: But she's been on
her own for a long time.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:90%
So she can get by.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what I pick.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.786 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm getting.

00:19:32.786 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: But you don't
know her, do you, George?

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.278 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No, I've never
been introduced to her.

00:19:37.278 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: You're doing it.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.964 align:middle line:90%
You're doing it.

00:19:40.964 --> 00:19:41.780 align:middle line:90%
I am?

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Yes, that
is absolutely true.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:90%
She's single.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:84%
She's been single
for a long time.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine that you
can look out her eyes

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're at home, and you
could see her favorite person.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So envision that she's got
a huge wave of excitement

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and she's looking because
her favorite person just

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.742 align:middle line:90%
walked in the door.

00:20:05.742 --> 00:20:07.075 align:middle line:90%
What does that person look like?

00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:09.985 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.985 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Some guy
with a mustache.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:90%
She seems very content.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.794 align:middle line:84%
She even looks like she's
going to start walking around.

00:20:19.794 --> 00:20:21.335 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Ask her
if she has babies.

00:20:21.335 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Um, she has had babies.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:90%
She's popped a couple eggs out.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And how does
she-- But did they hatch?

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.082 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they hatched.

00:20:35.082 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: And what happened?

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She says-- Now,
that's going to sound strange.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
She said, in our custom,
we're not as motherly

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.210 align:middle line:84%
as you, humans, are to babies,
so they go off on their way

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:90%
pretty early.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And we basically
forget about them.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.795 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.795 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Wow.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's pretty deep.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Wow.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So it's like she
had kids, and they're gone.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Well,
I'll tell you, when

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I say to her, who's your
favorite other person, what

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I see is a blond-haired
little girl with kind

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.589 align:middle line:90%
of long blonde hair.

00:21:21.589 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Maybe her owner?

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, you don't who owns this.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Her owner,
her owner's daughter.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm aski-- Ask
her her favorite activity

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.410 align:middle line:90%
in the whole world.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.510 align:middle line:84%
That's also envisioning
that you're in her body

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.452 align:middle line:84%
and you're so excited,
and you're so happy.

00:21:37.452 --> 00:21:40.546 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She doesn't
like being in a box.

00:21:40.546 --> 00:21:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Gonna
agree with that.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She's tired of that.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: This little
girl plays, uh, I

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:90%
hear Madonna, Madonna music.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:90%
She loves music.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.125 align:middle line:84%
She loves it when the
girl comes in and sings.

00:21:57.125 --> 00:21:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've been
told in my ear piece

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.124 align:middle line:84%
that she has laid eggs,
they just told me.

00:22:01.124 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty good.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: And ask
in your ear piece

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:90%
about a blond little girl.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I thought
it was a male.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I'll tell
you how you can tell.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.580 align:middle line:84%
You can tell by the
length of their tail.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:84%
A female has a triangular
tail, and a male

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:90%
has a long skinny tail.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: It's a tortoise
from Africa, they say.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.755 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: And she is a female.

00:22:25.755 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, she's
ready to roll now.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: She's not married.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:90%
She's a single lady.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:90%
She's older.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
She's the matriarch
at the family.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:84%
She considers herself
to be the nanny.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She's come
out of her shell

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:90%
since you've been with her.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: It's a little girl.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Look at her go.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.461 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.461 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: She likes
to spend time--

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She likes bananas.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: --in the kitchen
with the mom in the house.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's see if we can
taunt her with a little banana.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Here you go, little one.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: So ask her,
George, if tortoises

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.485 align:middle line:84%
have a message for
the human race.

00:23:05.485 --> 00:23:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:84%
What are they
trying to teach us.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She says we go
too fast with everything.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Said you need to slow
down a little bit,

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.156 align:middle line:90%
like they do and enjoy life.

00:23:21.156 --> 00:23:21.655 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:23:21.655 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, how do I pick that up?

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:90%
It's just like coming to me.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just, I'm
not thinking about it.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Don't go over the edge.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.230 align:middle line:90%
It just flows.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like a black
chalkboard and it's

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.090 align:middle line:84%
like just comes
across like that.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: That's right.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference in the
thoughts that you manufacture

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.130 align:middle line:90%
and in incoming information.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Incoming information is-- if
you could turn on the radio

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.312 align:middle line:84%
and you're listening
to music, now

00:23:53.312 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:84%
you're not making that music
up when you turn on the radio.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: No, it's there.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Every animal
is singing a song.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Every animal's on a
different frequency.

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's our
responsibility to develop

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:12.070 align:middle line:84%
the radio inside our minds so
that when a horse or a dog,

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
or a cat, or a parrot,
or a lion sends you

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:20.725 align:middle line:84%
a message, that you're
actually able to hear it.

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier
than you thought

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.320 align:middle line:90%
it was going to be, isn't it?

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yes, and
much friendlier.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been around
turtles all my life as a kid.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
In those days, you
used to buy them out

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.095 align:middle line:90%
of the department stores.

00:24:34.095 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:90%
They don't do that anymore.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.040 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.771 align:middle line:90%
This one's pretty-- pretty open.

00:24:41.771 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of them
stay in their shells,

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:90%
their heads are tucked in.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:84%
After a couple minutes,
she's out and about.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: It's the way
she's responding to you.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And she's fast.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Yeah,
they're super fast.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
now is you're

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:90%
functioning like a battery.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.140 align:middle line:84%
There are two different
currents-- one's going out,

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:90%
but one's coming in.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I teach people
to do is to develop

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:84%
the part of themselves
that's the radio.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, she'll live a
long time, too, by the way.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:84%
The big ones in the Galapagos
Islands, 120 years old.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.386 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: Yeah.

00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: They've seen
all kinds of things.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.989 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: I've worked
with some in Africa

00:25:22.989 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:90%
that are over 100 years old.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:90%
They're a wise race--

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.078 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They've seen it all.

00:25:27.078 --> 00:25:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: --a wise old race.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.971 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that they're
actually older than dinosaurs?

00:25:30.971 --> 00:25:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, they are.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: And they haven't--

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They never changed.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KINKADE: --needed to change.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.766 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They never changed.

00:25:35.766 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: They were
already perfect.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: She won't eat.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.635 align:middle line:84%
She says that she doesn't like
to eat in front of people.

00:25:43.635 --> 00:25:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: Talking to you
is a lot more interesting

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.468 align:middle line:90%
than that banana.

00:25:46.468 --> 00:25:48.607 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:25:48.607 --> 00:25:50.065 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So we
won't flip you over,

00:25:50.065 --> 00:25:52.910 align:middle line:84%
but we are going to put you
back in your box pretty soon.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:84%
All right, so when you do this--
I'll put her back in her box.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she won't stop now.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:90%
That's her banana.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.180 align:middle line:84%
When you do this, as we
wrap things up here, Amelia,

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I made
that connection or not,

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:84%
but I did come up
with these things

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't consciously
think about it.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.740 align:middle line:90%
They just popped up in my head.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:90%
So is that how it's done?

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KINKADE: The
information's already there.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So the animal's already
thinking and feeling.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're able to
resonate on that level,

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:84%
you're able to turn on that
radio and hear that music.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we
get confirmation on it

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
is to get a hold of the
tortoise's person and say,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:84%
is it true you have
a blonde daughter who

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.990 align:middle line:90%
likes Madonna music?

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I know, I'm hearing bells, like
little jewelry boxes, things

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that you wind up, that
there's a little girl

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.610 align:middle line:90%
in this family who loves music.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And this tortoise
likes to be in the sink

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:84%
in the kitchen
watching mom cook.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a red-headed dog that
looks like an Irish Setter.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.660 align:middle line:90%
There's a red-head woman.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:10%
There's a grey-headed woman.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:10%
That must be grandma.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.810 align:middle line:10%
So all these things
that are happening here,

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:12.984 align:middle line:10%
you can pick up on when
you learn how to tune in.

00:27:12.984 --> 00:27:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's amazing.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.410 align:middle line:84%
What an interesting
career you have, Amelia.

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:18.910 align:middle line:84%
People want more
information on what

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:90%
you do, how do they find you?

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:25.121 align:middle line:10%
>>KINKADE: On my website,
which is www.ameliakinkade.com

00:27:25.121 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Super.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:10%
OK, this is amazing,
whether you have an animal

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.270 align:middle line:10%
at home-- a cat, a dog, I hope
you learned just a little bit.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:10%
Or you could communicate a
little bit better and make

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.012 align:middle line:10%
your life and theirs a
little more enjoyable.

00:27:40.012 --> 00:27:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Noory, and you've
been watching "Beyond Belief."
