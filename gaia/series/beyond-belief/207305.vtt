Munka said, your father's fine.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:84%
He's going to live at
least another 15 years.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:84%
But if you want, at the hour of
his death, I will be with him.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So I was sitting at
my father's, 15 years

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:90%
later, at his deathbed.

through the window, which was

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And I sat up, and I
knew it was Munka,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:90%
and I knew my father had died.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Golden angels
came for him, and one of them

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:84%
was sent by you

I knew that Munka

We've got another
spectacular guest

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:10%
for you, Susan Plunket, a
psychologist and a science

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.480 align:middle line:10%
fiction writer.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Interesting mix.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
She received her doctorate
at the New School

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
for Social Research, and
that was back in 1989.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And for more than
30 years, Susan

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
has been in private practice
working with individuals,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.980 align:middle line:90%
couples, and families.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And for the past 10 years, she's
been writing science fiction

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:84%
in which she explores the
worlds of the fourth and fifth

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:90%

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
That's an interesting mix,
psychology and science fiction.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.400 align:middle line:84%
How in the world did
you mix it like that?

>>PLUNKET: It was
visited upon me.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:10%
I thought--

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: It was your mission.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.665 align:middle line:10%
>>PLUNKET: I think it was--

00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:44.890 align:middle line:10%
I thought my mission was
to be a psychologist.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.560 align:middle line:10%
And maybe it was, but suddenly,
in my 60s, I started getting--

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:10%
well, I had gotten some of the
messages earlier and ignored

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:10%
them--

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:10%
that I was supposed
to write, and that I

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:10%
didn't need to worry about what
it was, that I would receive

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:10%
most of it in my dreams,
and I would write it down,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:10%
and it would be information
that would be useful,

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:10%
and that it should be a story.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.965 align:middle line:84%
And because I had been working
with this Australian shaman,

00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:19.215 align:middle line:90%
the daughter of an Aborigine--

00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Aha.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: --I
totally trusted her,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't think
twice about it.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.435 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was that a
good or a bad thing?

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: It was a good thing.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: It was a good thing
because she had so much wisdom.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:90%
She channeled these beings.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
They identified themselves
to her as the archs,

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and I always imagined
that they were archangels,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know for
sure what they were.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.110 align:middle line:84%
But when they would
speak to me through her,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I would just want to weep.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Because when the heart is
touched, the eyes overflow.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, absolutely.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: And they would
say such amazing things.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And one time they said to
me, stop being so serious.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Eat a cookie.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Have a cocktail.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, this is
what they're telling me?

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But they also said
serious things like--

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.952 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Was it
easy, though, for you

00:03:11.952 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to mix psychology and science
fiction, or was that difficult?

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: It was kind of easy
because I'd been a Jungian--

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I am a Jungian psychologist,
and Jung was a mystic.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: So I was prepared
to be open to ideas.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was
in first grade,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
I asked my first grade
teacher, Miss McGinness,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:90%
what are we doing here?

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.040 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing here?

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
aren't you Catholic?

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I was six-- what does that
have to do with anything?

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.533 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are we all
doing here on this planet?

00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You were that
perceptive at that age?

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: I don't know.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.970 align:middle line:90%
I was just curious.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And she said, stop
looking out the window

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and moved my desk over
by the bulletin board.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think I was asking
then, what are we doing here?

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And then over time, I
had wonderful teachers,

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.560 align:middle line:84%
disincarnate teachers, even
while I was a psychologist

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.775 align:middle line:90%
and before.

00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Many people, I think, read
"The Seth Material" channeled

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.020 align:middle line:90%
by Jane Roberts in the '60s.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: But as a young
girl in my early 20s,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:90%
I started reading that.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.775 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, oh, I'm
living in multiple dimensions

00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
at the same time,
and we all are.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And you knew that.

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:90%
You felt that.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Yeah, because Seth
was just talking about it.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:84%
That's when I realized
that some of the dreams I

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
was having were me, myself,
in other dimensions.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, one night,
when I was young,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I dreamt that I lifted a
metal bridge off a person

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and pulled them out
like I was a superhero.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
what that could possibly

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:84%
mean until I read
"The Seth Material."

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And Seth said, all of us,
you, me, everyone watching,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.140 align:middle line:84%
lives in multiple
dimensions at the same time

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.565 align:middle line:84%
and has multiple lives
going on at the same time.

00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I'm
beginning to believe

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
that because they seem
to sometimes cross over,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.380 align:middle line:90%
don't they?

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Yes.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you dream, you
can dream of yourself

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:84%
in those other lifetimes,
and we can enrich ourselves,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and ourselves can
enrich our other selves.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:90%
So we are magnificent beings.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:84%
That's, I think, the mission
that I wasn't doing when

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I was just working one on
one as a psychologist, which

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:90%
I am still doing.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is it possible, Susan,
that déja vu is that crossover

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.347 align:middle line:90%
between these other dimensions?

00:05:45.347 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Possibly.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.613 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what déja vu is.

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I always
thought of that.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.447 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: I don't know what--
yeah, if you thought of it,

00:05:51.447 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
it's possible because thoughts
come to us from somewhere

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:90%
inside our brain.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.495 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did you
become a Jungian?

00:05:58.495 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Even since high
school, I liked Carl Jung.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:90%
I liked what he said about--

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
there is another who lives
within us that we don't know.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:84%
We think we're the only
master in our house, just

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.425 align:middle line:90%
our conscious self.

00:06:13.425 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Not so, right?

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.781 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Not so.

00:06:15.781 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Not so.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:84%
He's right, and that's
where Carl Jung agrees

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
with both Seth, and the
archs, and many mystics who

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:84%
say we're much vaster
than we have any idea.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:84%
We're living in all these
other realities simultaneously.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You
specialize in dreaming.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Yeah.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Dream interpretations.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Yeah.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What is a dream to you?

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:90%
What does a dream mean to you?

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Many different
types of dreams.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
There are dreams where we
may be working out a problem

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:90%
or getting a visitation.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Like, my father came to me in
dreams after he transcended,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:90%
so people do have those.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: True.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Because it's
easier for people who are just

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.060 align:middle line:84%
incarnate to visit us
in dreams because it's

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:90%
less frightening for us.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yes.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: But there are also--

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.448 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And easier for them.

00:07:11.448 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: And easier
for them to weave in.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:84%
But there are also dreams
where our other selves

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:84%
are communicating with
us from their life.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:90%
And there are also dreams--

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
we can dream of our
lives on other planets

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
as other planets, other
dimension, and other selves

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Now, we have a program
on Gaia called the "Microdose."

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing series.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Darryl Anka talks
about channeling.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into that right
after we look at this.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Can we prove that the
messages coming through

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:10%
the channeler are, in fact,
from a legitimate otherworldly

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.605 align:middle line:10%
source and not just
the work of charlatans?

00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DARRYL ANKA: I
did a channeling

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.590 align:middle line:84%
with my head wired
to an EEG machine.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:10%
And one of the most
profound things

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:10%
is that there are certain
centers of the brain that

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:10%
are responsible, supposedly,
for processing the personality.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:84%
During the channeling state, my
personality center is shut off.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm not there,
who's speaking?

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we
found out is that there

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
are certain things
that are called

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:84%
set points that are
not supposed to change

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.700 align:middle line:90%
throughout your lifetime.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:84%
The set point, when I
channel, changes in seconds,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.647 align:middle line:84%
and that's not supposed
to be possible.

00:08:28.647 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting take.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.813 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:08:30.813 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: I think
he's 200% right.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Not only all the things he's
talking about in the brain,

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
but your whole body
chemistry changes.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Different thoughts
can change your body,

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.039 align:middle line:84%
like when you're
getting information--

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:84%
well, we're always all
getting information

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
from outside our brain because
our brain is a receiver.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constant.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:90%
It's constant, yeah.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.977 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Constantly.

00:08:51.977 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But we mostly tune
to the physical

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:90%
because we're in the physical.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
When we're awake,
we're in the physical,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
so we pay a lot of attention
to the physical reality.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you tune inward, you
have inner senses as well.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Just like we have ears, and
eyes, and noses, and skin,

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:21.710 align:middle line:84%
we have inner senses,
intuition being among them.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:84%
When you tune into those,
it's a whole other world.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.050 align:middle line:84%
It's an entire other world,
and it's a beautiful world.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And as vast as
the starry heavens

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:84%
are outside of us
when we're awake,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.637 align:middle line:84%
that's how vast
the inner world is.

00:09:38.637 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If you can tap into it.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Well, we all
tap into it in dreams.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:90%
We all tap into it.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: If we remember.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: If we
remember, and most people

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.550 align:middle line:90%
can be trained to remember.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have fears
or beliefs which block us

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:90%
from remembering our dreams.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:10%
If we're afraid of that inner
reality, that deeper reality,

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:10%
we might not want to
remember our dreams,

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.135 align:middle line:10%
but most people can
learn to remember.

00:10:05.135 --> 00:10:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susan, what
or who is Munka?

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Munka-- I
now know who Munka is.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But during the 1990s,
every Wednesday, I

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
would go to visit
a woman, and there

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.710 align:middle line:84%
were four or five
of us who would go,

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:90%
and she would channel Munka.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And Munka would have
conversations with each of us,

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
telling us things that
were going to happen,

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:90%
and then they did happen.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And once I said to Munka--

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Munka was very funny, also.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, when you were
alive on Earth-- and he said,

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:90%
I was never alive.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.332 align:middle line:90%
I never had a human body.

00:10:45.332 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He never
had a human body?

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.123 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: He never was a human.

00:10:48.123 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:90%
So I said, well--

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
exactly what he was.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And then one of those
Wednesdays, my father was ill,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.470 align:middle line:90%
and I was upset.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
to Munka about it.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Munka said, your father is fine.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
He's going to live at
least another 15 years.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you want, at
the hour of his death,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I will be with him
because there's nothing

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
more powerful than the prayer
of a child for a parent.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Huh.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: So I was sitting
at my father's death--

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.780 align:middle line:90%
15 years later, at his deathbed.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: As he predicted.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: As he predicted.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:90%
And I asked Munka--

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I called on Munka and
asked him to be there,

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.415 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know that he
would be there at that moment.

00:11:26.415 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You had no way of
really communicating with him,

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.882 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: I didn't know.

00:11:29.882 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I could feel
sometimes, him.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:90%
So that night, I went to bed.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
The nurses said,
family should go home.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:90%
It's 10 o'clock.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Go home.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And I sat up in bed,
and a light came right

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
through the window,
which was closed,

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:90%
and was whooshed around me.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And I sat up, and I
know it was Munka,

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:90%
and I knew my father had died.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.077 align:middle line:84%
And the next minute, my
brother knocked at the door

00:11:54.077 --> 00:11:55.994 align:middle line:84%
and said he just got a
call from the hospital.

00:11:55.994 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He just passed away.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: And a week later,
I was talking to an intuitive.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what was my father's
transition like for him?

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said golden angels
came for him, and one of them

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
was sent by you
with the initial M.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
I knew that Munka

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.275 align:middle line:90%
was an angel, a golden angel.

00:12:18.275 --> 00:12:19.275 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's amazing.

00:12:19.275 --> 00:12:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: I hadn't known that--

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.483 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, my god.

00:12:20.483 --> 00:12:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: --in all the
years I sat at his feet.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But he also told me,
you have been a seeker.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:84%
You are a seeker, and you
have another career to come,

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:90%
besides being a psychologist.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
But I was still
younger then, so.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Is Munka
still with you?

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Occasionally, I
will ask something of Munka,

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.163 align:middle line:84%
but more who is with
me are the archs.

00:12:47.163 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Oh, tell us about that.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: The
archs were the group

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
channeled by the
Australian shaman,

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:90%
the daughter of an Aborigine.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And them I feel because
whenever they're around,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.140 align:middle line:90%
I start weeping.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Really?

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.740 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Because they touch
my heart so much that it just

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.860 align:middle line:90%
causes me to weep.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And the archs are the ones
who told me to write a science

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:90%
fiction trilogy.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:90%
They were just flat out.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.368 align:middle line:84%
Through speaking,
through [INAUDIBLE] said,

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:90%
you're supposed to write.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to write a--

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:90%
I said, but I'm a psychologist.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:90%
They said, never mind.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:84%
You can't help very many
people as a psychologist.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, 20 years
before that, Munka

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:84%
had said the same thing to me
that the archs were saying.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, you really don't
have any power to do much.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.443 align:middle line:84%
But if you let me work through
you, I will help your patients.

00:13:44.443 --> 00:13:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He will
get you that way.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.693 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: So I did.

00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I let him work through
me, and I could

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:90%
feel him dropping information.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, channeling
is very important.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.998 align:middle line:84%
And author and
channeler Paul Selig--

00:13:58.998 --> 00:14:00.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know Paul or not.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: No.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.015 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was on the
Gaia show "Open Minds."

00:14:03.015 --> 00:14:05.447 align:middle line:90%
He talks about channeling.

00:14:05.447 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: And those who
don't already know your work,

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:84%
tell us what happened 30 years
ago that blasted you open.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL SELIG: That was
a series of things,

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:10%
but I was 25 years old.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:10%
I had a list of
things that I thought

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:10%
I needed to achieve in the
world that would make me OK.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I got the whole list.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't OK.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I began to look for
something more, really, out

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.950 align:middle line:84%
of sheer necessity,
not because I

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.750 align:middle line:84%
thought it would be
nice to get spiritual.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I'd been raised pretty
much an atheist.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.712 align:middle line:84%
There was this thing happening
in 1987 called the Harmonic

00:14:36.712 --> 00:14:37.512 align:middle line:90%
Convergence.

00:14:37.512 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: Oh, I remember it.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.212 align:middle line:84%
>>SELIG: People were
going to be waking up.

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And in my naivete,
I thought, well,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:84%
if there is a god or
something like a god

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and you ask to be woken
up to it, why would it

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.910 align:middle line:90%
want to say no?

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And I went up to the
roof of the building

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that I lived in the
night before this event.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And somebody had given
me a mantra and a crystal

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:90%
and I thought you needed props.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MEREDITH: All the tools.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SELIG: All the props.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And I went up there, and
I asked to be woken up.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think I asked from a place
of real sincerity and a belief

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.180 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps something might
happen, and something did.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was an experience of
energy moving through my body.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.522 align:middle line:84%
It began now, I would know,
at the base of the route.

00:15:17.522 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And it just pushed,
pushed, pushed,

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and out through
the top of my head

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and left me swaying in
this energy on the roof.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
for all I know,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:90%
I was hyperventilating up there.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's what it was.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But I started seeing
the lights around people

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:90%
shortly thereafter.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And for me, who'd been
raised with nothing,

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:84%
it was a tangible
experience of energy,

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:90%
and it came in a beautiful way.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me
something to trust,

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and it became an anchor for
me after I began opening up

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
as a clairaudient after
I studied healing,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:90%
which was a few years later.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And I found that when I had
my hands on people's bodies,

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:90%
I could hear things for them.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I was volunteering at a center
for people who were living

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.985 align:middle line:90%
with life-challenging illness.

00:16:03.985 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:84%
It was the height of the
AIDS epidemic in New York,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and there were these pop-ups.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And I had my hands on somebody,
and I heard the name, you know,

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Frederick.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And I learned to
say, who's Frederick?

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.595 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, well, that's
my father, or that's my son,

00:16:15.595 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:90%
or that's my dog.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And I began to trust
the transmission.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of a process, really,

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.060 align:middle line:84%
of becoming a radio
for a transmission that

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.322 align:middle line:90%
now expresses itself in books.

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he has a radio--

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.763 align:middle line:84%
Susan, he's been on our
radio show several times.

00:16:32.763 --> 00:16:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: He's great.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.222 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he during some of
the most remarkable channeling

00:16:36.222 --> 00:16:37.130 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.377 align:middle line:84%
He literally metamorphoses
into this other being--

00:16:41.377 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: He's a voice channel.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --instantly.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: He's a voice.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.110 align:middle line:90%
He's wonderful.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I mean, he'll go
like-- he'll be him talking,

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.647 align:middle line:84%
and then he goes into this
other spirit or whatever it is.

00:16:51.647 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: It's wonderful.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he'll go,
chonk-chonk-chonk-chonk,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.553 align:middle line:84%
and it's bizarre,
but he does it.

00:16:56.553 --> 00:16:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: It's great.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:90%
That takes a lot of courage.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a voice channel.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:90%
I'd be afraid.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I just let everything kind
of sink in, but he's like--

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
one psychic said
you want to do it.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm afraid.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.242 align:middle line:90%
I give him so much credit.

00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I remember the
Harmonic Conversion.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.783 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:17.783 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:10%
>>PLUNKET: And it's wonderful
that he used that opportunity.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:10%
I was in Central
Park at the moment

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:10%
in 1987 of the
Harmonic Convergence

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.910 align:middle line:10%
with millions of people.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe his building
was overlooking it.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But that's fantastic that he
has the courage to go with that.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:90%
I am not as brave as him.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:90%
I write it.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I write what I hear and learn,
but I'm afraid to leave my body

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and let, like he did, like
Jane Roberts did with Seth.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Like Carla
Rueckert did with Ra.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:90%
I'd be afraid to do that.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle line:84%
But mine is more just like
a knowing and a dreaming,

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:84%
of course, because
it's easy for them

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.068 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
me in my dreams.

00:18:05.068 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Whatever
happened to the channeler

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.540 align:middle line:90%
who would channel Munka?

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: She decided to
become a straighter person

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and to just use Reiki
and Reiki healing,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and she stopped
channeling Munka.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know whether Munka
stopped coming through her

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:19.505 align:middle line:90%
after 20 years.

00:18:19.505 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.650 align:middle line:90%
Or went to somebody else?

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.448 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Or went
to somebody else

00:18:23.448 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:84%
or just went into a
different dimension.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But she stopped channeling
him, and she's a Reiki healer,

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and she works in hospitals
in New York City now.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.495 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:18:32.495 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, these archs that
you have spoken about,

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:90%
are they there to help us?

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Yes.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: What's their mission?

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Their mission
is for each of us

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we're
divine, and that help

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:51.690 align:middle line:90%
is right there if you just ask.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.800 align:middle line:84%
I said to them, I don't
know how to write books,

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:90%
and how will I get a publisher?

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.890 align:middle line:90%
And they said, never mind.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:90%
Never mind.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:90%
It will all be given to you.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I don't know how
John Hunt Publishing and I

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:90%
connected.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:84%
I have no memory of it, but
I got a letter saying, yeah,

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.175 align:middle line:84%
we'll publish
"Mission from Venus."

00:19:17.175 --> 00:19:17.975 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:19:17.975 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Poof!

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: The second letter--

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.301 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Just like that.

00:19:19.301 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: --we'll publish
"The Wanderers on Earth."

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And I must have
sent them something.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.860 align:middle line:84%
I cannot find
anything in my emails,

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.980 align:middle line:90%
but I think it was the archs.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.780 align:middle line:90%
And I mean--

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Destiny.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: --John Hunt
publishing is in England

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:90%
and I'm in New York.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a UK publisher.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:90%
And they're perfect for me.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:90%
They're laid back, not critical.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:90%
It's just a perfect match.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to go through
sending out to hundreds

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.960 align:middle line:90%
of agents or publishers.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:84%
It just happened, and I think
the archs made it happen.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And maybe
you made it happen.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Well, our
beliefs create our reality.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's something
that Jane Roberts was saying

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.250 align:middle line:90%
in the '60s, that Seth said.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Your beliefs can make your
life a heaven or a hell

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
because we actually
create material reality

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.516 align:middle line:90%
through the electromagnetic--

00:20:19.516 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: We create
our own environment.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: We do, we do.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:90%
We're powerful.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And whatever it
is, we paint that picture,

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:27.690 align:middle line:90%
and it happens.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: We're so powerful.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if there's any takeaway
from our time together,

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
our show, I want all of
your viewers to get it.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:84%
You are multidimensional
people, beings.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.730 align:middle line:90%
You are so powerful.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.744 align:middle line:84%
You are powerful beyond
your wildest dreams.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How long did it
take you to learn that?

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: All my life.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.370 align:middle line:90%
I only recently learned that.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:52.345 align:middle line:90%
I only recently--

00:20:52.345 --> 00:20:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And so you--

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: 50 years.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.338 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You could have had
this knowledge years ago.

00:20:56.338 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Yes, but I was too
pigheaded or too believing

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:84%
in my ego and in my
material existence

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.720 align:middle line:84%
to understand that this
much of me is immaterial.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:84%
But all the rest, probably
80%, is in other dimensions,

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:90%
in other lifetimes carrying on.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I wish that I knew
this in my 20s,

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:90%
but I only recently learned it.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Woulda, coulda.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Woulda,
coulda, shoulda.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:90%
But so what?

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:90%
I woke up in this lifetime.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I'm awake and aware.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:90%
And I had a happy life.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm so lucky, but somehow I
stumbled through enough stuff

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle line:84%
to wake up, but it was all
thanks to the teachers I had

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:90%
and all this incarnate.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.447 align:middle line:90%
Munka didn't have a body.

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: None of them did.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: None of them.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Seth didn't have a human body,
although Seth had been a human.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: He said
he was speaking

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.770 align:middle line:90%
to us all from fifth dimension.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.580 align:middle line:90%
Munka never had a body.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
The archs never
had human bodies.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Are the
archs like angels?

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: I think of
them as archangels,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:90%
but they're like a group mind.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.515 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Yeah.

00:22:19.515 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: When
they communicate,

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:90%
it's from a group mind.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.820 align:middle line:84%
All these disincarnate
teachers, I am so appreciative.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And we're always
getting messages.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.067 align:middle line:90%
Like on my way--

00:22:31.067 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Constantly.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.358 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: --here
from the airport,

00:22:33.358 --> 00:22:38.230 align:middle line:84%
this truck kept riding by the
car, and it kept on saying,

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:90%
source, source.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It was probably energy
source or something.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:90%
But source is the divine.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I think it was reminding me
that we're all part of source.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.990 align:middle line:90%
We're all one being.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Just like all the
cells in our body

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
have their own consciousness,
each of our organs

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:84%
has its own consciousness,
our body's like--

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.320 align:middle line:84%
each organ is like a state
and we're the country.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's independent with its
own consciousness, but also,

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:90%
part of the whole.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And then out from
that, you, me, everyone

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:90%
is part of a greater whole.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Law of One
is about, the Ra material.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Ra is another
disincarnate being who's

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.250 align:middle line:84%
speaking from the
sixth dimension.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:25.775 align:middle line:84%
And he spoke in the 80s
through Carla Rueckert.

00:23:25.775 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Oh, we've
got a video of this.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Oh, you do?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Let's let the--

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Oh, there?

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Let's
let the pictures--

00:23:29.375 --> 00:23:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Fantastic.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --give us 1,000 words.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Fantastic.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Between 1981 and 1984 physics
professor and UFO investigator

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Don Elkins interviewed
medium Carla Rueckert,

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:84%
who claimed to be channeling a
group of entities known as Ra.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:84%
In a series of
106 conversations,

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Ra declared to be a sixth
density social memory

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
complex that was attempting to
aid in the spiritual evolution

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.240 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Through Carla, Ra relayed
a wide range of teachings,

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:84%
including reincarnation,
the history

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.545 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, pyramids,
Atlantis, and even Bigfoot.

00:24:08.545 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLA RUECKERT: All
things, all of life,

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:25.540 align:middle line:84%
all of the creation is part
of one original thought.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Truly
remarkable, Susan.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Remarkable.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:84%
The work that they did
over those few years

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.785 align:middle line:84%
is an incredible gift,
just an incredible gift.

00:24:34.785 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Cutting
edge, wasn't it?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: What?

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:37.827 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Cutting edge.

00:24:37.827 --> 00:24:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Yes, cutting edge.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And they paid a price for it.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because the dark side
could also have come through.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
the dark side did

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
try to kill Carla
Rueckert several times.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Wow.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: I only recently
became aware of their work.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Because having focused
most of my life

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:84%
on Seth, and the archs,
and Munka, my own people--

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.090 align:middle line:84%
but their work is
brilliant and wonderful.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:09.167 align:middle line:84%
And some people say it drove the
physicist, Don Elkins, crazy.

00:25:09.167 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Yeah, that
it helped pushed--

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: And
that he shot him--

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: --him over the end.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: He shot himself.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He committed
suicide, yeah.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:14.843 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: He committed suicide.

00:25:14.843 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Because there are other
higher dimensional entities

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that would like this planet
to go to the dark side.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.573 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How do we know the
other entities didn't kill him?

00:25:28.573 --> 00:25:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: My
opinion is that they

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:84%
did because they
couldn't get Carla

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.180 align:middle line:90%
when they tried to kill her.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.565 align:middle line:84%
So my opinion is they
probably did kill him.

00:25:37.565 --> 00:25:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is Ra?

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Ra is
what they just--

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.530 align:middle line:84%
he just said it perfectly,
a multidimensional,

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:50.250 align:middle line:84%
six-dimensional consciousness,
group consciousness,

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that apparently evolved on
Venus, which is why I actually

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.570 align:middle line:84%
love the fact that I
called my first book

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:58.800 align:middle line:90%
"Mission from Venus."

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: And I have
my characters who--

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I actually believe one of them
is me in a different dimension,

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.090 align:middle line:84%
this one character
called Soonam.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned the
word Ra in the book

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and in a lot of
that information.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And I love the stuff that
they channeled, but--

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Why do they seem to
meddle in our affairs, Susan?

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: I think most
of them want to help us.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I do think that they
want to help us wake up

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and understand who we really
are, that we're divine,

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:90%
divine beings.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: So you think
they're benevolent?

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: I think most
of them are benevolent.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I think most beings
are benevolent.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:52.140 align:middle line:84%
There are dark entities
who would like--

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.420 align:middle line:84%
in my understanding,
from one psychic

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:84%
that I worked with
over a period of years,

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:84%
there are some
dark lords of Orion

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.280 align:middle line:84%
who slipped through
the quarantine.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And it may have been
them who got Don Elkins.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Because he wasn't
always that way, was he?

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Was a physicist,
a trained physicist.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:90%
He was an airline pilot.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:90%
He was making--

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: And he seemed grounded?

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Yeah.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.520 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.140 align:middle line:84%
No, I think we'll
never know for sure,

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:28.370 align:middle line:84%
but it was doesn't take away
from the power and the beauty

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:90%
of the work that they did.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And it helped me understand
what's going on here,

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.240 align:middle line:84%
the power that we each have
and the choices that we

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.300 align:middle line:84%
make to be in service to
self or service to others.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to be
in service to all of us,

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
as I believe most of these
beings who come through are.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, I may let
someone speak through me.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But for now, I prefer to
receive information the way

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:02.045 align:middle line:84%
I always have, just
kind of dropped in.

00:28:02.045 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:90%


00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's been tremendously
helpful with patients,

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:90%
but that's just one on one.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:90%
That's not very many people.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hoping that
these books eventually

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:90%
will let everybody know--

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:17.435 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm sure they are.

00:28:17.435 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: --how
much they're loved.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's really the thing.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.350 align:middle line:84%
We are so loved, and
we are so powerful.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And we just think we're just
using these little chemical

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.940 align:middle line:84%
houses just like
a temporary rental

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that we made for ourselves to
walk around in this dimension,

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:84%
to learn that we can
create with our thought.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is the
Law of One, Susan?

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.600 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: That is
what Ra was teaching

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:84%
when he was speaking through
Carla, that we are all one.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when you
understand that you're all one,

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:84%
you can travel from place
to place with thought alone.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.620 align:middle line:84%
You can, as they did in
"Harry Potter," just apparate

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:90%
from place to place.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:84%
When you see the
universe as one being,

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:90%
one giant consciousness--

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: One, yeah.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: --that you channel,
I channel, everyone channels.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so exciting
to think that we are only

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.100 align:middle line:90%
limited by our own thought.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.747 align:middle line:84%
What you can imagine,
you can create.

00:29:23.747 --> 00:29:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're creating all the
time because our thoughts are

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.490 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic, and they
created our bodies before,

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:84%
because we had a consciousness
before we were born,

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have a consciousness
after we transcend.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we think our
consciousness is mostly around

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.790 align:middle line:90%
this body, but it isn't.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.515 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it is in
our other bodies.

00:29:45.515 --> 00:29:48.597 align:middle line:90%


00:29:48.597 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But we don't understand that
all the time because we get

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:84%
caught up in what am I
going to have for dinner?

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And what movie should
I watch on Netflix?

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Our physical life.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, when your
clients come to you,

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.640 align:middle line:90%
do they have issues?

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Yeah.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you try to
save them from these issues?

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.690 align:middle line:84%
What's the method
here that you use?

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:13.515 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Well, nobody comes
to me without pain because why

00:30:13.515 --> 00:30:14.315 align:middle line:90%
would they--

00:30:14.315 --> 00:30:15.523 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're all in pain.

00:30:15.523 --> 00:30:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: --bother
to pay a psychologist?

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And mostly, they come, a
couple problems, anxiety

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:90%
or depression.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:84%
But at some level,
they're out of sync

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:84%
with their higher
being, and they

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.940 align:middle line:84%
needed to get back in sync
with their higher being.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we experience
pain, whether it's

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, depression, or
trouble in a relationship,

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:84%
when we're not in alignment
with our higher being.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Because there's our
current personality,

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and there's our hard
being, and then there's

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:90%
our connection to source.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it's as simple as
getting back into alignment,

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.342 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
Munka would help.

00:30:59.342 --> 00:31:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There's
a Gaia documentary

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:84%
called "Tuning In"
as Darryl Anka talks

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:09.780 align:middle line:84%
about Bashar, explaining
his relationship to Darryl.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ANKA: An arrangement,
so to speak,

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
was made prior to the
physical life of the channel,

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:84%
within what you would call
the over-soul of the channel

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.950 align:middle line:90%
of which I am also a part.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.170 align:middle line:90%
We are part of the same soul.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:84%
You might refer to me as
the channel's future self.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And incarnationally
speaking, I would

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.210 align:middle line:84%
look at the channel
as my past self,

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.920 align:middle line:90%
just to put it in linear terms.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Right.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Because he's saying that
to put it in linear terms

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.491 align:middle line:84%
because there is no past
and future because it's

00:31:41.491 --> 00:31:42.574 align:middle line:90%
all happening at one time.

00:31:42.574 --> 00:31:43.574 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: It's right mow.

00:31:43.574 --> 00:31:44.438 align:middle line:90%
It's the present.

00:31:44.438 --> 00:31:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: All of our lives,
and all of our dimensions,

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and all of ourselves
are lived right now.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lesson
in that when I

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.800 align:middle line:84%
did a life between
life regression,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:84%
I went to another
psychologist who does this.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.880 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people do
past life regression.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not past life.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a simultaneous life.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: But accidentally,
Michael Newton discovered,

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.090 align:middle line:84%
because he was
regressing people--

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:84%
some of them were going
to-- instead of a past life,

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.040 align:middle line:84%
they were going to
an in-between life

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.120 align:middle line:84%
where they were didn't
have a human body.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And he was
baffled by that, wasn't he?

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: And he was baffled.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he was baffled.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized, oh, these
people are going to their place

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:84%
where they go when
they're dead and planning.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:30.230 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted to go over there.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So it takes about eight
hours, four hours and then

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:90%
another four hours.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And people I went to a guy
trained by Michael Newton,

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.480 align:middle line:90%
and I went over.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.160 align:middle line:90%
You go to your last--

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.600 align:middle line:84%
you go to a death that
you have access to,

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.520 align:middle line:90%
and you watch yourself die.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I was a Japanese man who
had committed hari-kari.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.230 align:middle line:90%
I watched myself die.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.348 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: World War II?

00:32:52.348 --> 00:32:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: I'm not sure--

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Possibly?

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: --of the timing,
but I watched myself--

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sounds like it.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Yeah.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Die in that lifetime, and then
I found myself over there.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was greeted by an
entity I knew to be Carl Jung,

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.257 align:middle line:90%
and I was weeping so much.

00:33:11.257 --> 00:33:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You get emotional
with these things, don't you?

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Yeah, because
it's so beautiful.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And the psychologist
who was taping it

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:23.020 align:middle line:84%
kept on trying to get me to talk
so he could know where I was,

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:90%
and I was--

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And you
were crying, right?

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: And I
didn't want to talk

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:84%
because everything was
happening with mental telepathy.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Right.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: So it was a mental.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy and when you're
over there, there's no words.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't have
this kind of body.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.160 align:middle line:84%
The psychologist was
saying to me, well,

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.360 align:middle line:90%
what do you look like?

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
don't talk to me.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to communicate
telepathically.

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:48.740 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK--

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: I'm in this other mode.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Leave me alone, right?

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: And he
said, look down.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down, and
I was this blue oval.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And this being that I knew
was Jung was a purplish oval.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.840 align:middle line:10%
And we were telepathically
communicating,

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:09.120 align:middle line:10%
and he was trying to teach
me about the power of thought

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:10%
to create, that it is actually--

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.560 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Which is very
powerful, isn't it?

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Yeah.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetic energy to
create material things,

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.210 align:middle line:84%
as we believe
material things to be.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, if anybody
wants to visit that realm,

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.969 align:middle line:90%
you just go to Michael Newton.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.590 align:middle line:90%
He's transcended now.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.576 align:middle line:84%
But website-- and you
can go to between lives.

00:34:32.576 --> 00:34:33.909 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: He was one of the best.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:34.750 align:middle line:90%
He was a giant.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Yeah, he thought he
was just doing normal past life

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.110 align:middle line:84%
regression, but his patients,
as so often the case,

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:90%
just taught him.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many ways
to know ourselves that we

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.394 align:middle line:90%
don't imagine are possible.

00:34:53.394 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susan, do you
ever come across evil

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:59.357 align:middle line:90%
in your investigations?

00:34:59.357 --> 00:35:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: Not so much
because I think evil--

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:07.420 align:middle line:84%
well, here's the psychologist
speaking to you more than--

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: OK, give us a session.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: [LAUGHS] I think
when we don't accept our own

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:14.610 align:middle line:90%
shadow--

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:84%
this is a Jungian term, our own
dark side, our own selfishness,

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:24.740 align:middle line:84%
jealousy, impatience, anger,
if we press it down too much

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.140 align:middle line:84%
rather than saying, yeah,
I have those thoughts--

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.925 align:middle line:84%
thoughts are always
flowing through--

00:35:28.925 --> 00:35:32.430 align:middle line:90%


00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:38.260 align:middle line:84%
we can create a heavy weight, a
shadow, and it drags behind us.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think evil is a kind
of repressed dark side

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.460 align:middle line:90%
that we don't accept.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: But it's there.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PLUNKET: But it's there,
and it can form thought forms,

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and then the thought forms
are abroad in the land,

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and other people can
encounter those thought forms.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Or you can create them and
you can encounter them.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And then once something
is created, it's there.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the evil
that comes in, as we spoke,

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:10.420 align:middle line:84%
that might have killed Don
Elkins, higher dimensional

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.360 align:middle line:84%
beings coming from
a place like Orion.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And that's
pure evil to--

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Well, they want--

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.500 align:middle line:84%
even the dark side serves
source in its own way,

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.880 align:middle line:90%
but they would like--

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:90%
they have a different agenda.

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:31.620 align:middle line:84%
According to Ra, you can
proceed on the dark path

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.540 align:middle line:90%
of controlling other people.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And the ultimate control is
what happened to Don Elkins.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.209 align:middle line:84%
To take someone's life,
that's the ultimate control.

00:36:39.209 --> 00:36:40.626 align:middle line:84%
You can proceed
on the dark side--

00:36:40.626 --> 00:36:41.522 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Absolutely.

00:36:41.522 --> 00:36:42.480 align:middle line:90%
And force him to do it.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: Yeah.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.200 align:middle line:84%
That's really taking
control of another person.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.780 align:middle line:10%
And the more control you
take of another person,

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.110 align:middle line:10%
the more powerful you
become on the dark side.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.600 align:middle line:10%
On the path of light,
the more you're

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.530 align:middle line:10%
in service to other people,
the more powerful you become.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.480 align:middle line:10%
And we all make a choice.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.150 align:middle line:10%
But up to the sixth
dimension, you

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:06.450 align:middle line:10%
can go forward,
controlling other people

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.070 align:middle line:10%
or serving other people.

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:12.420 align:middle line:84%
But after the sixth dimension,
apparently, according to Ra,

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.573 align:middle line:84%
there's no way forward
except in service to all.

00:37:17.573 --> 00:37:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Susan, thanks for
being on "Beyond Belief."

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.657 align:middle line:90%
>>PLUNKET: I loved it.

00:37:20.657 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:84%
You were the
greatest to talk to.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She is
absolutely right.

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:27.540 align:middle line:10%
The power to change our
life is within ourselves.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.470 align:middle line:10%
Do it.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm George Noory.

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.350 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for watching
"Beyond Belief."
