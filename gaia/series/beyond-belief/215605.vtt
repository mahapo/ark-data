00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGE NOORY: Welcome
to Beyond Belief.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:10%
You are going to
love this program.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.170 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jeffrey Long,
radiation oncologist,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:10%
is a leading researcher
in near-death experiences.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.000 align:middle line:84%
More than 25 years ago,
he founded the Near-Death

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Experience Research Foundation,
which hosts over 4,000

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
scientifically
studied NDE accounts.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
His groundbreaking work is
featured in his special book,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:90%
God and the Afterlife.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.965 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrey, my friend, it's
good to see you in person.

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY LONG: George, it is
such a pleasure to be here.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.465 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: How have you been?

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: I've been fantastic.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I have been enjoying life
and continuing my research

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and looking forward to talking
about it with you today.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: How did a radiation
oncologist get interested

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:90%
in near-death experiences?

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.280 align:middle line:10%
>>LONG: Over 25 years ago, I was
in my residency training program

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.260 align:middle line:10%
and my medical
specialty of radiation

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:10%
oncology, the use of
radiation to treat cancer.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I was flipping through a
Journal of the American Medical

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Association journal,
and quite by accident

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
found the title of an article
that had the word, the phrase

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:90%
near-death experience.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was puzzled
because everything

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd been taught as a doctor
was, you're either alive

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.350 align:middle line:90%
or you're dead.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or you're dead.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: What's this
near-death experience thing?

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So puzzled, I read
the whole article

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and was immediately fascinated.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Here was a cardiologist,
a heart doctor

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:84%
who'd studied a
series of patients

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that had cardiac arrest,
their heart stopped.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So at that time,
consciousness should

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
be impossible for his
group of patients.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:84%
They had a very
lucid experience,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
a near-death experience
in which they

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
were able to observe
ongoing earthly events,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
including their
own resuscitation

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and their description
of what they

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:84%
saw while they were
literally comatose

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:90%
after their heart stopped.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.620 align:middle line:84%
What they saw, what
they described accurate,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:84%
down to the finest
details, I was fascinated.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how can you not be
fascinated about wondering

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:90%
what happens after we die?

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Give us your
definition of what

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.350 align:middle line:90%
a near-death experience is.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: As the name
near-death experience implies,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%
you're near-death,
in other words,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:84%
you're so physically compromised
that you're unconscious

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
or clinically dead with
an absent heartbeat.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So at that time that
your consciousness should

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:84%
be absolutely flat, a blank
memory during that gap,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:84%
people do have the experience
part of a near-death experience.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, while no two near-death
experiences are the same,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.180 align:middle line:84%
they are very lucid,
organized experiences.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
The elements, the
characteristics,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:84%
what occurs during them are
very consistently observed

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and typically in very
consistent order.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What drove
you into being not only

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:84%
the oncologist that you
are and a darn good one,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:90%
but studying NDEs?

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.975 align:middle line:90%
How did that blend?

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: Well,
that's interesting.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I guess I've always had
a fascination with what

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
lies beyond death's door,
and I guess I've always

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:90%
been interested and intrigued.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And as a scientist,
all of a sudden, when

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I started my study of
near-death experiences,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
hearing these
experiences over and over

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and over from so many different
people, I suddenly realized,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
wow, this is empirical,
scientific evidence all

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
converging on the
reality that there really

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:90%
is life after death.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
A wonderful life after
death for all of us.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Would you bet the
ranch on that statement?

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: I would bet the ranch
and everything else I hold dear.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I have encountered a
mountain of evidence.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:84%
We have on our website a
scientific study, as you said,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
of over 4,000
near-death experiences.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a basic
scientific principle,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:84%
what is real is
consistently observed.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And in my near-death
experience research

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmingly, we
consistently see

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
people describing
what occurs during

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:84%
the near-death experiences,
things that should be absolutely

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:84%
impossible given that
they're physically

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:90%
unconscious or clinically dead.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:84%
Very dramatic, very
strong powerful evidence

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
that there really is
survival of consciousness

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.329 align:middle line:90%
after bodily death.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, some very
strong evidence as to what

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.443 align:middle line:84%
literally lies in that life
beyond our earthly life.

00:04:28.443 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, let's give
some of our incredible Beyond

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Belief viewers some examples
of near-death experiences.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:84%
You had a friend whose wife
had an NDE, what happened?

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Sure.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things that
really formulated my interest.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I had never heard anybody
share a near-death experience.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So here I was with a
college friend and his wife,

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and we were enjoying
a nice meal.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And she mentioned that she had
a lot of medical allergies so

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.600 align:middle line:84%
severe, in fact, that while she
was under general anesthesia,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.920 align:middle line:84%
she had a bad allergic reaction,
encoded, her heart stopped.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But she said it in a funny
way and my medical instinct

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
was, I think there might
be more to that story.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:90%
I wonder if she--

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:90%
I wonder, I wonder.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So I asked her, during the
time you were under anesthesia

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and your heart stopped,
did anything happen?

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
George, that should have
been the stupidest question

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It should have been
impossible for her to have

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:90%
any memory at that time.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.047 align:middle line:84%
But I'd read about near-death
experiences and I wondered.

00:05:27.047 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Well, you were curious.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.297 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: I was curious.

00:05:29.297 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Her immediate response was
like she was almost relieved

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:84%
that somebody asked and
she could finally share

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.420 align:middle line:90%
was an immediate yes.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And she went on to describe that
very first near-death experience

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:90%
I'd ever heard of.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.100 align:middle line:84%
She went through as is
typically described,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
a tunnel she was in
that unearthly, often

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:90%
called heavenly realm.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
She saw portions
of her prior life,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I'd learned later that's
called a life review.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
She encountered some
deceased loved ones

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and had a joyous interaction
with loved people

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:90%
she'd lost on earth.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And finally, at
the very end, she

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
had, as so many people that have
a near-death experience have,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:90%
a choice.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to return
to your earthly life

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:84%
or stay in this
beautiful realm where

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:84%
they feel that overwhelming
sense of peace and love?

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And she wrestled
with that decision.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here she was, all she
knew in her earthly life was

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.220 align:middle line:84%
that had led up to that was her
friends, family, and loved ones

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and yet it was a difficult
decision for her.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.170 align:middle line:84%
She finally decided to go
back to her earthly body,

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and when she recovered,
she had an experience

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:90%
she didn't understand.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I read about that.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I think you had one of these
near-death experiences and boom,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.360 align:middle line:84%
right off the bat,
George, I said,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I've got to learn
about this because

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.620 align:middle line:84%
if near-death
experiences are real,

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.857 align:middle line:84%
this changes my whole view
of the universe we live in.

00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And at that
point you did not

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
know Raymond Moody
or people like that.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:84%
You weren't the
expert you are today.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: I had read
about a book and a half.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know Raymond Moody, I
didn't know about that research.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And this was very
early, don't forget,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:84%
back in the early 1980s when
there really wasn't a lot

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.505 align:middle line:90%
written.

00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
I'll admit this, I was actually
going into this a skeptic

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a show-it-to-me
kind of person.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Well, there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: I think that's
a very good point,

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and especially I mean,
heck, I treat cancer

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and I make my decisions
for life saving treatments

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:84%
based on reasoning and
scientific evidence.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was fascinated.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I was, being a show-it-to-me
kind of person,

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
I started my scientific
exploration of near-death

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.070 align:middle line:84%
experiences, basically
saying, if these are real,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:90%
what I'm going to see is--

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I put up my Near-Death
Experience Research Foundation

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
website and have
that survey, what

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see if
these things are real.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to observe something
very consistent and very

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:90%
remarkable.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.173 align:middle line:84%
And wow, that was
over 25 years ago.

00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: You sure did.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Did I learn in a hurry?

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Near-death experiences, that
was my first early lesson.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Near-death experiences
are, in a word, real.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What got you to put
the Near-Death Experience

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Foundation together?

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: It was that curiosity.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It was literally that beginning
of hearing my college friend's

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.955 align:middle line:84%
wife talk about that,
of reading that article,

00:08:12.955 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and reading just like
a book and a half.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I had nowhere near a
scholarly knowledge

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:90%
of near-death experience.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't convinced, based
on that amount of evidence,

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:90%
that they were real.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I was just so fascinated
and so curious

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:84%
that I just had to
know for myself.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And as a scientist, I wanted the
best evidence that I could get.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And the best evidence
is those people

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
that share those
accounts that actually

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
had a near-death experience,
that could share them

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
without any constraints freely
and in their free sharing

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.410 align:middle line:84%
with me allowed me to understand
from that original source

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
of evidence and answer
that burning question,

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:90%
are near-death experiences real?

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.378 align:middle line:90%
And boy, did I ever find out.

00:08:53.378 --> 00:08:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I had a
friend, Jeffrey, who

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:90%
died in a motorcycle accident.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:90%
He was doing something stupid.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:90%
He was going way too fast.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And he hit something and
went flying in the air

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:84%
and landed on top
of a stop sign,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:90%
it just about severed his body.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:90%
He died.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
At the funeral home, I'm looking
at his body in the casket,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and for some reason, it hit
me that there is no afterlife.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I've never thought
of that before.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:90%
I've always been a believer.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But I just looked at him
and said, this is it.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:90%
It's over for him, it's done.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:84%
It was the worst,
coldest, starkest feeling

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.745 align:middle line:90%
I have ever had.

00:09:36.745 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I snapped out of it, and I never
want to feel that way again.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:90%
What happened to me?

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: George, you were
observing a dead body.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we're talking
about with near-death experience

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is alive, vibrant,
supernormal consciousness.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It is basically all that they
were in their earthly life

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:90%
and a lot more.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And what a contrast that is
to seeing a body, somebody

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:84%
who was living an earthly life,
friends, family, loved ones

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and there he is,
suddenly dead, unmoving.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Very sad, sadness
just enveloping

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:90%
that whole funeral scene.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sewn together.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Oh, yeah.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So I can certainly
understand that.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a normal
reaction, George.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
I would feel that way,
too, if you see a dead body

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and yet I know from every
bit of my extensive research

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.275 align:middle line:84%
that the consciousness, if you
will, their soul, their being,

00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
who they really are,
is no longer down

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:90%
there in that physical body.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:90%
They are up above.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.975 align:middle line:84%
They are continuing their
eternal spiritual existence

00:10:43.975 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
in a realm, in an existence
free of those constraints

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.027 align:middle line:84%
of that dead physical
body down there.

00:10:50.027 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: He was
probably looking at me

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
that day saying,
George, I'm here.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.515 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK, I'm fine.

00:10:56.515 --> 00:10:58.305 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: I'll bet he was.

00:10:58.305 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And the good news is,
it's both you and I have

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
gone in our journeys and
grown in understanding.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
We can now look at each other
and say, hey, we know both of us

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
without a shadow of a
doubt that, that wasn't

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.610 align:middle line:84%
the end of the
line for him, that

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the end of
his eternal existence

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.160 align:middle line:84%
that he really does
have an afterlife

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:90%
and a wonderful afterlife.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's some of the
really remarkable good news,

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
literally inspiring
thing that's driven

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:84%
me to research this because that
is such phenomenally good news.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm sad too, George, when I
go to funerals, obviously.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I've had
a few, I hate them.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: Oh, it's so rough
because there's so much sadness

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's the end of
that earthly life.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet I know deep
down inside of me,

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:84%
there's that I know full well
that, that person who died

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.850 align:middle line:84%
is, like you said, I like that,
I think they're aware of us.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.405 align:middle line:84%
They're conscious of
it of all that we are.

00:11:52.405 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:84%
They're conscious
of our sadness,

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure they share
in some degree, too.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But what's far more
important is that they

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:84%
are beginning the rest of
their eternal existence

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
in a realm full of peace,
love, harmony, awareness,

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.000 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, and far
beyond what we could

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.810 align:middle line:90%
experience in our earthly life.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, they
are, in a real sense,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.880 align:middle line:84%
those people that die
in an earthly sense.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:84%
They're liberated,
they're able, they're

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:84%
free in a way they never could
have been in their earthly life.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: I want to get into
your book, God and the Afterlife

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.200 align:middle line:84%
in a moment, but tell us
the story of Anita Moorjani.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Oh, that was great.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.150 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I we
collect the experiences

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:84%
shared with us on the website,
and we review them every week.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's a fairly long process.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So we make sure that we
meticulously share them back

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:84%
with the world that was
shared with us freely.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So one day we're
just sitting here

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:84%
going over the experiences
that were shared

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and here's one from
Anita Moorjani.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And I start reading it
and I'm like, oh, my gosh.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I respect all
near-death experiences, all

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:84%
of them contain a kernel
of understanding of wisdom

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and help me to
grow and understand

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences and their
bigger message of the greater

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:90%
realm of consciousness.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But Anita, that was just off the
chart, incredible, magnificent.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
near-death experiences

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:84%
that you read over and over,
and even after 25 years,

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I would still love to go back
and hear what she has to say,

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.625 align:middle line:84%
read her experience, and
it's just absolutely amazing.

00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:84%
All the different
things that she

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
said, how she was
able to literally,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
during her near-death
experience,

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.830 align:middle line:84%
choose a path where
she would either

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
make one decision
and she'd go on

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
to permanent,
irreversible death.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Make another decision
and the laboratory

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
blood tests were
drawn, would come back

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:90%
showing she was recovered.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:84%
She made that decision, and
boom, she ultimately survived.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Had an amazing
near-death experience

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and just gloriously able
to share it with the world.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
By the way, that was
literally the first time

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Anita had shared her
experience was on the website.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So needless to say, I
immediately got hold of her

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, no, Anita, you
have a message for the world.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.228 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody that's had a
near-death experience, if they

00:14:12.228 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:84%
have the courage and the
will, the need to share.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But what you have is so
important for humanity.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I just encouraged her
to try to share that,

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and I really feel like
I was helpful with Anita

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
to bring that incredible wisdom
into near-death experience,

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:84%
that truth, that understanding,
and help share it

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
as she's doing now
all over the world

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.920 align:middle line:84%
to both inform people and
be inspirational, literally,

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.820 align:middle line:90%
globally.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Do you think we
have that choice of staying

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:90%
or dying and moving on?

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: That's a great
question, because many times

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:84%
during a near-death
experience, here they

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.700 align:middle line:84%
are in that beautiful,
unearthly, heavenly realm.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:90%
The two most common words--

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: No pain,
bliss, everything.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Exactly.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the two
most common words

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:84%
in the narratives
describing their experience

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.158 align:middle line:84%
is peace and love,
and light is actually

00:15:05.158 --> 00:15:06.950 align:middle line:84%
probably the number
three most common word.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.570 align:middle line:84%
But it is beyond anything
they knew on earth in terms

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:84%
of how they're feeling,
that peace, that love,

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:90%
that connection with each other.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So to actually leave
that beautiful realm is,

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine, I
mean, don't forget,

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:84%
they were in the grasp of often
a horrible, painful battle

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:84%
with their life in an event
that nearly killed them,

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and yet here they
are in the afterlife.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, the majority of people that
have near-death experiences,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
they don't get to
make a decision,

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
boom, they go right
back to their body.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:84%
But in that minority of
near-death experiences

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
where there's other
spiritual beings around them,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.170 align:middle line:90%
they do have that choice.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And interesting, even though
their entire earthly life

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:84%
was years, typically
decades of their existence

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and their memory,
when they're given

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:84%
that choice and that
beautiful heavenly realm

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
about going back to
their earthly life

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:84%
or staying in that
heavenly realm,

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:84%
the significant majority
don't want to leave

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and will often argue very firmly
with the other spiritual beings

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:90%
No, I want to stay.

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:90%
This is beautiful.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:90%
It's pain free.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They're forced back.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: Yeah, and
then ultimately

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:84%
they are either
returned involuntarily

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.750 align:middle line:90%
or they make a choice.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Of that minority of near-death
experiencers that make a choice,

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I've studied that why on earth
would you want to leave heaven?

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's from a near-death
experiencers perspective,

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.130 align:middle line:90%
here's what they say.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:84%
They come back certainly family
relationships, especially

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:84%
children, seem to be very
important and important reason

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:90%
for them to want to come back.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And then perhaps the number
2 reason are lessons.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
They understand that their
earthly life, however

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
difficult, painful, and even
an earthly life where they're

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
fighting for their life is
important, far more significant,

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
far more meaningful than
they ever thought before.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So they realize that they need
to come back to earth because it

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.662 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:16:55.662 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:84%
There's lessons, there's
things they can learn,

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
things they can
experience that are

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.020 align:middle line:84%
going to be extremely valuable
for themselves as souls.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, tell me about
the title of your book, God

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:90%
and the Afterlife.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Sure.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:84%
My first book was Evidence
of the Afterlife, the Science

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
of Near-Death Experiences,
went on to be a New York Times

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:90%
best seller.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So, gosh, we had a lot of
near-death experiences shared

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.579 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I couldn't
help but notice over and over

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.099 align:middle line:84%
and over in these near-death
experiences, people

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:90%
described God.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:10%
Now, I would emphasize
God is a human word.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:32.030 align:middle line:10%
And over and over we heard
from near-death experiencers,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.700 align:middle line:10%
God is the best word we have.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.810 align:middle line:10%
It's a human word.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't begin to
do justice though

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:10%
to what they encountered
in a near-death experience.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
They said, this
entity, this being

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:84%
of overwhelming beyond earthly
love of light, of accepting them

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:84%
for who they are and
all that they are.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.310 align:middle line:84%
They said that is
almost limited by trying

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.970 align:middle line:90%
to put earthly words on it.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So with that awareness,
I was like, wow,

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:84%
this is some of the strongest
empirical, scientific evidence

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.220 align:middle line:84%
for the reality of God that I
am aware of exists in the earth

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:90%
today, and that's a huge deal.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be God, a very
critical part of the afterlife,

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
if you will, a part
of our destiny.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So that led me to do what
I called the God study.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So I asked a very
specific survey question

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:84%
from my near-death experiencer,
during your experience,

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
did you encounter any
information or awareness

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:84%
that God or a
Supreme being exists?

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was astonished, George,
that a little over half

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
the respondents said, yes,
that they did encounter

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.610 align:middle line:84%
that awareness,
that understanding,

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:84%
making it one of the
most common things

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that near-death
experiencers encounter.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And the narrative box after
that, people described, again,

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.790 align:middle line:84%
over and over a being of
overwhelming, compassion,

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.360 align:middle line:84%
love, beyond anything that they
could have imagined on earth.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, amazingly reassuring
to have that God so interested

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:90%
in us, so nonjudgmental.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:84%
That is a very consistent
theme, so deeply loving

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:90%
for who they are.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It didn't make any
difference if they

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of serious
faults, they were still

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
loved for who they are, all they
were, everything that they were.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:10%
And I saw that over
and over in these,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.570 align:middle line:10%
and I thought that was important
enough information that I wanted

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:10%
to write a whole book
about that to help share

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.670 align:middle line:10%
that with the world, to help
people understand that there

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:10%
really is that scientific
evidence for the reality of God,

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:10%
and that it is tremendously good
news for every single person

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:10%
in this world.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:10%
>>NOORY: Is there that one
profound story, Jeffrey,

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.640 align:middle line:10%
that you just do not forget?

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: Oh, yes there is
and let me tell you that.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the real questions we
have in near-death experience

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.330 align:middle line:84%
research is why do some people
have near-death experiences when

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:90%
they nearly die and most don't?

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Only about 10% or 20% of
people that nearly die

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.390 align:middle line:90%
have a near-death experience.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.950 align:middle line:90%
So most--

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: And then
you have people

00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:55.510 align:middle line:84%
like Dannion Brinkley, who just
keep dying and coming back.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: There are the Dannion's
of the world that keep dying.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.600 align:middle line:84%
But for people that nearly
die, about 80% or 90%

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:84%
don't have a
near-death experience.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So me and other researchers
have been puzzling about that.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But then one day, I was
almost like the Rosetta Stone

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.562 align:middle line:84%
of an answer came from a
near-death experiencer who,

00:20:13.562 --> 00:20:15.020 align:middle line:84%
during their
near-death experience,

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.180 align:middle line:84%
was having an amazingly
blissful, beautiful experience

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:90%
in this heavenly realm.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And they encountered
God, their word.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were so enamored
with the joy and bliss

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:29.900 align:middle line:84%
and love that they were feeling
that they asked God directly,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:90%
why me?

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Why am I so special that
this should happen to me?

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think God, in his answer,
addressed the question that

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:90%
was burning in my mind.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Why some have NDEs, some don't?

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:90%
God answered.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And almost verbatim, love
falls on everyone equally.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is special.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.275 align:middle line:84%
This is what you needed
to live your earthly life.

00:20:52.275 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Interesting.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: And all of a
sudden, the lights went off.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.790 align:middle line:90%
I said, I get it.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why some people
have near-death experiences

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.530 align:middle line:84%
because it is in terms of a
far higher consciousness, a far

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:84%
greater loving God that this
for that particular person

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.810 align:middle line:84%
needs that particular near-death
experience so they can go forth

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and live their world the rest
of their life in this world,

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.660 align:middle line:84%
aware of God's existence,
aware of that unearthly love,

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
that goal that, we should
all be shooting for love

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:90%
and that awareness of peace.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So really an inspiring
near-death experience.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:84%
It really opened me up to
understanding why some people

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:84%
have near-death experiences
and why some don't.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: The
experience with God,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.550 align:middle line:90%
do they see him or hear him?

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: It can be everything.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Many are aware of
God, others actually

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
encounter there's
an awareness of God.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.657 align:middle line:84%
By the way, this is
not a small data set.

00:21:47.657 --> 00:21:49.990 align:middle line:84%
We've literally have hundreds
of people that have either

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.770 align:middle line:90%
been aware of or described God.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is a compilation
of a very large number

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
of near-death experiences,
describing that.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:middle line:84%
The number one descriptor is
a nonformed being, a presence,

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:90%
and a light.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
A brilliant light
is often described,

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:84%
but a light unlike anything
they knew on earth.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.790 align:middle line:84%
They feel that
profound sense of love.

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Now they may feel that elsewhere
in this beautiful, unearthly

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:84%
realm, but with God
it is extraordinarily

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:84%
off the scale special even in
that unearthly, beautiful realm

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:90%
that they're in.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:90%
So they feel accepted by God.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:84%
It almost never, thank goodness,
do we have a sense of judgment

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
from God, and we've all done
some things we're not proud of.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And so to have that
overwhelmingly, consistently

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:90%
described, I find reassuring.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But then above and
beyond that, there's

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:38.580 align:middle line:90%
often a dialogue with God.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:10%
And they can ask God
a lot of questions,

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:10%
and they receive that
reassurance, that understanding

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.260 align:middle line:10%
that all of us,
everyone on earth,

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:10%
we're all part of
the eternal souls

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:10%
that this is in that afterlife,
that beautiful heavenly

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:10%
realm, that's our real home.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Being there, a part
of God with the ones

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.900 align:middle line:84%
that we knew in our
earthly life that died,

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that love rules the
universe, and that there's

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.670 align:middle line:84%
a very strong mystical
connection, a unity,

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.660 align:middle line:84%
literally, that we're simply not
aware of in our earthly physical

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:90%
lives.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:84%
It's part of that greater
reality with the glue that

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.370 align:middle line:90%
holds that afterlife together.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, does the
near-death experience skew

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:90%
age I mean, do kids get it?

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Absolutely.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.090 align:middle line:84%
I was curious too, I mean,
what about very young kids?

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And the study group I had
was age 5 and younger,

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
average age about 3
and 1/2 years old.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, that's
eerie for parents,

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.880 align:middle line:84%
you don't want your kid to
suffer a life threatening event,

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.780 align:middle line:84%
but I found 26 that did, and
they had near-death experiences.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Now at that young
an age, they're

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.300 align:middle line:84%
practically a blank
slate in terms

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:84%
of their understanding of death
or what life after death--

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Or even
remembering these.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.081 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Yeah, I mean, exactly.

00:23:53.081 --> 00:23:56.210 align:middle line:84%
If near-death experiences were
due to pre-existing beliefs,

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.900 align:middle line:84%
you'd expect the kids at
that young an age to have

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences all
over the board in terms

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
of what they experienced, but
that's not what the data showed.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
It showed, and we
compared the elements.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.510 align:middle line:84%
What occurs during a near-death
experience with 33 survey

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:84%
We were able to directly compare
the very young children age 5

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and younger with the
responses to survey questions

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:84%
about what happened during
their near-death experience

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.590 align:middle line:90%
with older children and adults.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And to my astonishment, there
was no statistical difference

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.320 align:middle line:84%
in any of the responses
to those questions.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed that, as some
of the strongest evidence

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine that
near-death experiences are not

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.570 align:middle line:84%
due to pre-existing cultural
beliefs, religious beliefs,

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.895 align:middle line:84%
concepts of what would
happen when you die.

00:24:42.895 --> 00:24:43.695 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Or age.

00:24:43.695 --> 00:24:44.495 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Age.

00:24:44.495 --> 00:24:45.440 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And other near-death
experiencers

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:90%
have found that too.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we had a
Dr. Sutherland look

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
at all the reported literature
about near-death experiences

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.280 align:middle line:84%
in children, came
up with exactly what

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:90%
I was finding in my research.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Age does not in any
way seem to make

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.170 align:middle line:84%
any difference in what happens
during a near-death experience.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What happens to
the child who has an NDE

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:90%
and then grows up?

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Do they carry that with them
for the rest of their life?

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Does it change their life?

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all of us
sit here and wonder,

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:84%
so many of us, what
happens after we die

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:90%
and we worry about it.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.910 align:middle line:84%
We may fear death, but all
of a sudden, these kids,

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
they know darn good and well
that they had an experience that

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:84%
allowed them to see
beyond the veil,

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:84%
beyond what happens
after bodily death.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And it really changes
them a great deal.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to them, it's not really
a question that the rest of us

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:44.290 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So they go forward with their
life, with a lot of the typical,

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:84%
we call after effects of
near-death experience,

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.520 align:middle line:90%
but starting very early.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they obviously
have no fear of death.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:84%
They know what lies
beyond death's door,

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and they know it's wonderful.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So increased belief
in an afterlife,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and they have that
strong sense that they

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.090 align:middle line:84%
need to reach out to others in
their earthly life in a very

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.300 align:middle line:90%
loving fashion.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And so they're very changed,
but very positively.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually not
as easy as it sounds.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Their knowledge,
their wisdom that they

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.060 align:middle line:84%
have from this very
young age is not

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:84%
going to be understood by
children their same age.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can imagine trying
to tell a five or six-year-old,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:84%
gee, I know that there's a
heaven and here's what happens.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it's challenging
for them to be

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
able to share with
their parents,

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.485 align:middle line:84%
to be able to share with
their parents, their siblings,

00:26:32.485 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:84%
the other children
that they play with.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So they're literally
wise beyond their years,

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and yet they grow up taking
a little piece of that heaven

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:84%
back into their life
and manifesting it

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
in the rest of their life in
some very positive, loving ways.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey,
we've been talking

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:53.900 align:middle line:84%
about the glorious moments of
NDEs, but what about the dark,

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:90%
hellish NDEs?

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: Yeah, hellish
near-death experiences are rare.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.820 align:middle line:90%
It's about 2% of the time.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I've worked hard on studying
that, and it's one of the things

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that I don't
understand as well as I

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:84%
do other aspects of near-death
experience we're talking about.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you, George,
some of the scariest things

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I've encountered
in my life are not

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:84%
reading fiction books
or horror stories

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:90%
or going to horror films.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Some of the scariest
things I've read in my life

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:84%
are these hellish accounts
of near-death experiences.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.060 align:middle line:84%
They are, in every sense
of the word, hellish.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the sights, the sounds,
the terror, what they feel.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
It is literally off
the scale horrible,

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and yet there's a silver
lining, if you deeply

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:84%
understand these hellish
near-death experiences.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So in my research of
literally dozens of these,

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I've come to understand
that when people

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.350 align:middle line:84%
have a hellish near-death
experience, importantly,

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.650 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that
they or anybody else

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.380 align:middle line:84%
is fated to have a
permanent involuntary hell.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Over and over we see
these people that

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.100 align:middle line:84%
have a hellish
near-death experience

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
can literally, when they're
in that environment, they ask,

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:84%
shout out, God, Jesus,
get me out of here.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And they are liberated
from that boom right away.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Other near-death
experiencers that

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:84%
have a hellish experience
like that come back,

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:17.445 align:middle line:84%
and they're very upfront
when they share it and say,

00:28:17.445 --> 00:28:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I needed a spiritual
kick in the pants.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I had issues in my life of
that anger, that resentments,

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.180 align:middle line:84%
that dark side of my soul, and I
needed to literally confront it,

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and there was no
other way for me

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:84%
to confront that
dark part within me,

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:84%
other than to actually
see it like that.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:39.120 align:middle line:84%
These people can go on and
manifest very positive changes

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
in their life and
be loving souls.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think another getting into
it from a philosophical angle,

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:84%
the fact that there is these,
first of all, a couple of things

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:84%
about hellish realms in
near-death experiences,

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:58.350 align:middle line:84%
it's not like they're integrated
and are part of the afterlife.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Over and over, when people
are aware of hellish realms

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.430 align:middle line:84%
in the afterlife,
they're segregated,

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:84%
separated from essentially
everything else in heaven.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So when people say, there can't
possibly be hell in heaven,

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:84%
they're correct, because
these hellish realms are

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.520 align:middle line:90%
very segregated and separate.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:84%
As best I can tell,
these are souls

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.220 align:middle line:84%
in the afterlife that make
probably a whole series of very

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.450 align:middle line:84%
bad decisions,
anger, resentments,

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.750 align:middle line:84%
evil towards other
spiritual beings.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What were they
like in their human form?

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: It's hard to say.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:84%
When we see even the
several dozen hellish

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.510 align:middle line:84%
near-death experiences,
they don't really say,

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.660 align:middle line:84%
oh, this was Hitler, this was
some named person on earth.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:45.120 align:middle line:84%
These are just demonic beings in
that segregated, separate realm

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.690 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But I think getting--
philosophically,

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:84%
as best I can tell,
these are souls

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.200 align:middle line:84%
that made a theory undoubtedly
a whole series of bad decisions

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.520 align:middle line:84%
ultimately step by step,
leading to them being dark

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and evil souls, even in a realm
where everybody around them

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:08.970 align:middle line:84%
is loving, connected in an
area of unearthly beauty

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:09.970 align:middle line:90%
off the scale.

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So my best idea about
how these hellish realm

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:84%
beings get into
this hellish realm

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is that they ultimately, as
part of their malevolence,

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:21.870 align:middle line:84%
even in the
afterlife, have chosen

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:84%
to be a part around other
people, other souls that

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:84%
are like them in
that realm of hell,

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:84%
in the afterlife, which
is an indication that even

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.350 align:middle line:84%
in the afterlife, we have
enough free will, the ability

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.680 align:middle line:84%
to express free will, that we
have the right to make even very

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.303 align:middle line:84%
bad decisions and ultimately
end up in that hellish realm.

00:30:41.303 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they're
there permanently.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I think they can leave if
they ultimately want to,

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:90%
they choose to leave.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But again, paradoxically, I
think these demonic beings

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:54.220 align:middle line:84%
in the afterlife and that
hellish realm, paradoxically,

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that's like their heaven because
they're with people around them,

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.592 align:middle line:84%
they're people that
share their beliefs.

00:30:59.592 --> 00:31:03.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to be known for
the malevolent being they are.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.790 align:middle line:84%
In the afterlife
as a soul, you're

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:07.410 align:middle line:84%
known for who you
are immediately

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:08.470 align:middle line:90%
and everything you are.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
how awkward that

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.010 align:middle line:84%
would be for some soul that
carried that dark malevolence

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:84%
into the afterlife to
be immediately known

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.880 align:middle line:84%
by all other souls
they encounter.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: There was a
woman who was on a horse,

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.250 align:middle line:90%
and the horse tossed her.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.670 align:middle line:90%
What happened to her?

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Sure.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:84%
She was riding a horse, and she
was out like about a mile out

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:32.640 align:middle line:84%
riding a horse and the
horse threw her and she was

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.940 align:middle line:90%
an experienced horse rider.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:90%
So this was very tragic.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Horse threw her,
she hit her head

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and she had a very
severe head injury.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.160 align:middle line:84%
She was immediately
fighting for her life.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And yet at that time she
had a near-death experience.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness arose and went
above her body on the ground,

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:84%
probably beyond
unconscious, comatose.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.500 align:middle line:84%
She saw the horse
without her slowly

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.220 align:middle line:90%
starting to make its way back.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.410 align:middle line:84%
But in that particular
near-death experience,

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:01.950 align:middle line:84%
remarkably, her
consciousness above her body

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.600 align:middle line:84%
as she observed her
body on the ground,

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.680 align:middle line:84%
went to where about a mile
away, where they had started

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.130 align:middle line:90%
that journey with the horse.

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Sure.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: From that
vantage point, mile away,

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.190 align:middle line:84%
she was able to see
the other people that

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:84%
were there in that stable
where the horse was.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.840 align:middle line:84%
She was able to
see and hear what

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.430 align:middle line:90%
was going on in great detail.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So when she recovered from
what nearly killed her,

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.680 align:middle line:84%
she checked that
out with the people

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.410 align:middle line:84%
that she saw a mile away during
her near-death experience.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
What she saw, what she
heard, accurate down

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.370 align:middle line:90%
to the finest detail.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Amazing evidence
that consciousness,

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.100 align:middle line:84%
apart from the body, far outside
of any possible physical sensory

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.900 align:middle line:90%
awareness.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.800 align:middle line:84%
When you have that out-of-body
experience separation

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in a near-death
experience, what they see,

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.700 align:middle line:84%
what they hear, absolutely
real down to the finest detail

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.210 align:middle line:90%
just about every time.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And we literally,
George, have scores

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.430 align:middle line:84%
of those types of
near-death experiences

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.530 align:middle line:84%
where their consciousness
goes far away,

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and they see and hear events
that when they check out later,

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly what was going
on right where their body was

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:90%
unconscious or clinically dead.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, some of the
strongest evidence

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness in near-death
experiences is exactly like they

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.340 align:middle line:84%
believe it is, apart from their
body and able to at times,

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:84%
go to different areas around the
earth and see and hear things.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, what is
supernormal sensory awareness?

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: Now here
on earth, I mean,

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:90%
we have five bodily senses.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:31.480 align:middle line:90%
We see, hear, touch, taste.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's pretty much
what we have here.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's fascinating about
near-death experiences is that

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.780 align:middle line:84%
over and over, they
describe some senses,

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.360 align:middle line:84%
awarenesses that
are far beyond what

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.140 align:middle line:90%
they had in their earthly life.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:84%
A very dramatic example of
that was the blind can see.

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:50.350 align:middle line:84%
There was a lady named
Vicky that I interviewed.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:52.750 align:middle line:84%
You want to talk about
supernormal awareness.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, Vicky was a
vivid example of that.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:90%
She was born totally blind.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.730 align:middle line:84%
To her, vision was
unknown and unknowable.

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.010 align:middle line:90%
So she went through her life.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:05.650 align:middle line:84%
She was in her 20s, and
she had a beautiful voice.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.180 align:middle line:90%
She was a professional singer.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.489 align:middle line:84%
And she was singing
in a bar one day,

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and an inebriated patron
tried to drive her home.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And, boom, very
severe auto accident.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.449 align:middle line:84%
So the first time
Vicky had vision

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.070 align:middle line:84%
was when she was having
her near-death experience,

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.170 align:middle line:84%
her consciousness
above her body.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.739 align:middle line:84%
And initially, she was
horrified because vision

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:27.219 align:middle line:90%
was so unfamiliar to her.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:28.540 align:middle line:90%
She was scared.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:84%
But when she calmed down, there
was her body down on the gurney.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't even
know it was her

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:84%
until she correlated the
feel of her long hair

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.730 align:middle line:90%
she knew she had in life.

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, her
father had given her a ring.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
She had never seen it.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.199 align:middle line:84%
But she was able to correlate
with that newfound sense

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:48.449 align:middle line:84%
of vision of the ring
down there with what

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:51.130 align:middle line:84%
she'd only known through a
sense of feel all her life.

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:55.179 align:middle line:84%
And then, boom, she realized,
that's me, that's my body.

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Vicky described what so
many near-death experiencers

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:84%
describe, and that is her
vision was 360 degrees.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Amazingly, she could
simultaneously be aware of,

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and process, visual awareness in
front of her, back of her right,

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:10.480 align:middle line:90%
left, up, down.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.510 align:middle line:84%
The proper term, I guess,
would be like spherical vision.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.040 align:middle line:90%
But she went through a tunnel.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.130 align:middle line:90%
She had a detailed life review--

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Classic NDEs.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: -classic NDE,
all the trimmings,

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.360 align:middle line:90%
but with stunning vision.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing is that when
I interviewed Vicky, I told her,

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.800 align:middle line:84%
hey, all of us on earth,
when we have vision,

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:84%
we have a pie-shaped visual
field because of the location

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.500 align:middle line:90%
of our eyes in our head.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can't
see, right, left, up,

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.740 align:middle line:84%
down because we're anatomically
limited with vision in our head.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And Vicky literally
laughed at me

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and said, no, that
can't be right.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:51.040 align:middle line:84%
She says, vision is you process
everything all around you.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.960 align:middle line:84%
How could your
vision be so limited?

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.715 align:middle line:90%
And George, that was awkward.

00:35:55.715 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I finally just said, OK, I
know that's your entire life

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.560 align:middle line:84%
experience with vision,
but I will tell you,

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.220 align:middle line:90%
your vision was exceptional.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And many, many other
near-death experiencers

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.290 align:middle line:90%
have described that too.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.180 align:middle line:90%
That's supernormal vision.

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And we have actually
a series of people

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.780 align:middle line:84%
that were either legally blind
or the near-death experience

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.882 align:middle line:84%
or substantially
visually impaired.

00:36:18.882 --> 00:36:21.090 align:middle line:84%
In everyone of those people
that we've asked a survey

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:84%
question directly about vision
during near-death experience,

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.080 align:middle line:84%
in every single
one of these people

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.110 align:middle line:84%
with severe visual impairment,
their vision during near-death

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:84%
experience normal or
more often, super normal.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So absolutely amazing, super
normal awareness beyond anything

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that they could have known in
their physical, earthly life.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is
the story, Jeffrey,

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:84%
of the Canadian
and his girlfriend?

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.098 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:36:46.098 --> 00:36:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: Oh, I'm glad you
brought that up, George,

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.900 align:middle line:84%
because that is an amazing
near-death experience.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Great story.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Oh, it really is.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.920 align:middle line:90%
So glad you brought that up.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.300 align:middle line:84%
This was a gentleman who
was driving his fiancée

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to her parents' house and
he fell asleep at the wheel

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.220 align:middle line:90%
and had his car crashed.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So boom, right after
his car crashed,

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:10.820 align:middle line:84%
he suddenly was aware that he
had that out-of-body experience,

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:84%
but he was holding
hands with his fiancée

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.370 align:middle line:90%
as they rose up over the car.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So as he rose up higher
and higher in the distance,

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
he could see that beautiful
landscape, undoubtedly

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.990 align:middle line:84%
that initial portal
into the heavenly realm.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But while they were up way
above the car, the two of them

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:31.600 align:middle line:90%
holding hands, four beings came.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Two of them were around him, and
two of them around his fiancée,

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and they very gently
separated their hands,

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and he felt so much
peace and love.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
He felt like he wanted
to say, no, wait, stop.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Stop that.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: Because here
they were holding hands,

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.430 align:middle line:84%
but he felt so much
peace and love.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:84%
He didn't really feel
like he was resisting.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.330 align:middle line:84%
He just felt so enveloped in
that powerful overwhelming sense

00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:84%
beyond anything on earth he'd
ever known in terms of love.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, obviously he felt
very loving from these beings.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But they separated his
hands, and two of the beings

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:12.000 align:middle line:84%
gently started taking
his fiancée forward

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.260 align:middle line:84%
to that beautiful
different realm.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And the other two
beings very gently

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:20.620 align:middle line:84%
started him back down on a
journey back down to his car.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:84%
From far above his car, you
could see the front end on fire.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:28.140 align:middle line:84%
There had been a severe
wreck and he returned

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and his consciousness
returned to himself.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.240 align:middle line:84%
He awoke from being
unconscious in the car,

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as he was restored
to consciousness with his car

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:43.390 align:middle line:84%
burning, he felt his fiancée's
head leaning on his shoulder,

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and he knew instantly
that she was dead,

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.145 align:middle line:84%
that he had left her with those
beings up above, and that she

00:38:50.145 --> 00:38:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: She died when
they left their hands.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: --she died and that her
body was simply an empty shell.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:00.640 align:middle line:84%
That is an incredibly touching
near-death experience.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's also very important in
displaying what we call a shared

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.680 align:middle line:90%
near-death experience.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.970 align:middle line:84%
These were two people who
shared the initial part

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:10.360 align:middle line:90%
of a near-death experience.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.940 align:middle line:84%
One went on to permanent,
irreversible death,

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and he went on living and
was able to tell the tale.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Shared near-death experiences,
and we have about 20

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.230 align:middle line:84%
of these we've received
over the years,

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:84%
are some of the
strongest evidence

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:26.660 align:middle line:84%
that we have that when you
die a permanent irreversible

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.870 align:middle line:84%
death, just like that
gentleman's fiancée, that what

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.970 align:middle line:84%
you experience in a
near-death experience

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.640 align:middle line:84%
may well be those
initial steps that

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.940 align:middle line:84%
go on towards that
journey to the afterlife

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and what we're being hearing
about in near-death experiences,

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.390 align:middle line:84%
that initial step to
that eternal spiritual

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:46.140 align:middle line:90%
forever in heaven.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Do pets have NDEs?

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Oh, absolutely.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: They do?

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: Oh, and I'm
glad you brought

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:55.627 align:middle line:84%
that up because I'm a pet lover,
I love dogs, I've had pet dogs.

00:39:55.627 --> 00:39:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: Who is it, right?

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: Oh, yeah, exactly.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So, for those of you
that are pet lovers,

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I've got some great news here.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.390 align:middle line:84%
We have scores of
people that have,

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.550 align:middle line:84%
during their
near-death experience

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:84%
in that unearthly
realm, encountered

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.460 align:middle line:90%
that deceased beloved pet.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:84%
As with deceased
people that they

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.800 align:middle line:84%
loved in their earthly
life, these pets

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.450 align:middle line:84%
are essentially always
picture perfect health.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And as you can imagine,
these are joyous reunions.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Here they are interacting with
that pet, that beloved pet

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that they lost and
sharing, interacting.

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:32.540 align:middle line:84%
It just recontinuing
that joy, that

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.370 align:middle line:84%
love that they had in their
earthly life and you name it,

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:40.670 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it, dogs, cats,
birds, horses, pets of all type

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:44.330 align:middle line:84%
are definitely present and
very much alive and well

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:47.180 align:middle line:84%
in the afterlife and waiting
for those of us that love them

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.500 align:middle line:90%
when it's our turn to go there.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.002 align:middle line:90%
>>NOORY: That's magnificent.

00:40:52.002 --> 00:40:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: I think, again, for all
the people that have had a pet

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and died that has some
profoundly positive news.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Does it matter
whether it's a dog or a cat

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.800 align:middle line:90%
or some other animal, a turtle?

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: No, I don't
think it matters at all.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Love is eternal, and I think
that is a vivid example

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:12.230 align:middle line:90%
of that principle and concept.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Here they are,
that love on earth,

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's the bond
of love doesn't

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:20.330 align:middle line:84%
end just because your
human beloved one died

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.080 align:middle line:90%
or your beloved pet died.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Love is eternal, and
that love continues

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:27.410 align:middle line:84%
to be expressed in
heaven, in that afterlife,

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.040 align:middle line:90%
and will go on forever.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just incredibly,
powerfully positive

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.910 align:middle line:84%
reassuring message for
those that love their pets

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and certainly love the people
that they've lost on earth.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:40.380 align:middle line:84%
That love is eternal,
it will never end.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: When you talk
about shared NDEs,

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrey, what happens, for
example, if a twin dies?

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:50.790 align:middle line:84%
One dies, the other lives,
is there a connection?

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: Wow, that's
a good question.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.710 align:middle line:84%
We only have about 20 shared
near-death experiences,

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and none of them that
I recall were twins.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really have
a good answer for that.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So I think certainly
I've studied

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.990 align:middle line:84%
what we call after
death communications

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and I do have a small
series of one twin that died

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.270 align:middle line:90%
and the other is there.

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly, there
can be that communication,

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.460 align:middle line:84%
that interaction even
after they're bodily dead.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, with other
after death communications,

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.870 align:middle line:84%
the most common time
that communication occurs

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:25.320 align:middle line:90%
is at the moment of death.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating about
these types of experiences

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:31.040 align:middle line:84%
is that they can
occur at the moment

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.030 align:middle line:84%
when one person
dies at that moment,

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean like to the
second when they die,

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:37.020 align:middle line:90%
the other person is aware of it.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.780 align:middle line:90%
We have scores of experiences.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.575 align:middle line:84%
They often happen
at night, boom,

00:42:41.575 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:84%
they're aware of
a communication.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I see them, I heard them, I
felt them, I know they just died

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.820 align:middle line:90%
and it's at night.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So your first instinct would
be to look at the clock

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:51.660 align:middle line:90%
and they do.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they know exactly
what the minute was.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
find out later

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:84%
that their twin or
their loved one died,

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.170 align:middle line:84%
if they were declared
dead at the hospital,

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:03.860 align:middle line:84%
they always have the time
of death declared down

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to the minute and in
scores of experiences

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:08.750 align:middle line:84%
right down to the
minute, boom, that's

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:11.780 align:middle line:84%
when they had that initial
communication from their loved

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.060 align:middle line:84%
one, from their friend's
family member who died.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, what do
you say to the skeptic?

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:23.390 align:middle line:84%
The one who says, once you're
dead, you're dead, that's it.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: There's a whole
lot of skeptics out there.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Once you're dead, you're dead.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I would have to say,
hopefully they have a respect

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:32.490 align:middle line:90%
and appreciation for science.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:34.950 align:middle line:84%
I would say, look at the
science of what we have.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:39.170 align:middle line:84%
There's such a body of science,
such a body of evidence

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:41.580 align:middle line:84%
that it's overwhelmingly
consistent.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe in science,
if you believe what is real

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:46.910 align:middle line:84%
is consistently
observed, then you

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.710 align:middle line:84%
have to embrace the reality
of near-death experiences

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's very consistent
message of life after death.

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But getting back to skeptics, as
a group, they're a funny group,

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I almost have to laugh.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.550 align:middle line:10%
Skeptics over the 25 years that
I've been doing this research

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:05.420 align:middle line:10%
have proposed over 30
different "skeptical"

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.030 align:middle line:10%
explanations of
near-death experience.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might be asking, why
are there so many of these

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:13.970 align:middle line:84%
"skeptical" explanations of
near-death death experience

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:15.000 align:middle line:90%
floating around?

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is very simple.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.060 align:middle line:84%
There's no one or
several explanations

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.330 align:middle line:84%
based on physical brain function
that makes sense to the skeptics

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.420 align:middle line:90%
even as a group.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics as a group
haven't put forth any,

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, technically they're
not really explanations

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:33.470 align:middle line:84%
when they say it's due to brain
chemistry or electrical activity

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.550 align:middle line:90%
or psychological reasons.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Technically, what they're
doing is raising hypotheses.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.640 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
might possibly explain.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, then let's take that
hypothesis of physical brain

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.370 align:middle line:84%
function and look at what
we actually observed.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what we've
been talking here.

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.000 align:middle line:84%
You know darn good
and well, George,

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.910 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing that
we've talked about here

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:55.220 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
actually happens

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.460 align:middle line:84%
during near-death experiences
that can possibly be explained

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.210 align:middle line:90%
by physical brain function.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: What is your
website, Jeffrey?

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.775 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: nderf.org, Near-Death
Experience Research Foundation.

00:45:06.775 --> 00:45:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: You and your wife do
a great job with that site.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.233 align:middle line:90%
>>LONG: I appreciate that.

00:45:10.233 --> 00:45:12.360 align:middle line:84%
That's literally our
second full time job.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a labor of love.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.840 align:middle line:84%
By the way, we don't
have anything for sale,

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and we just really
do that because we

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:22.098 align:middle line:84%
feel it is vitally important
for people all around the world.

00:45:22.098 --> 00:45:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And we have that
website, by the way,

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.110 align:middle line:90%
in over 30 different languages.

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a global outreach.

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:30.320 align:middle line:84%
For people sharing their most
powerful, profound experience

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.950 align:middle line:84%
of their lives, it's among the
biggest honors and privileges

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:37.290 align:middle line:84%
of my life to share that
freely back to the world.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So anyone on the planet
can almost certainly

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.950 align:middle line:84%
find these near-death experience
accounts in their own language

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and learn in their own way
that near-death experiences are

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.910 align:middle line:84%
indeed real, along with
their consistent message

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:52.823 align:middle line:84%
that we all have an afterlife,
a wonderful afterlife.

00:45:52.823 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: Jeffrey, thanks
for being on Beyond belief.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:56.407 align:middle line:84%
>>LONG: It's been
a real pleasure.

00:45:56.407 --> 00:45:57.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, George.

00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NOORY: If you had any
doubts about the afterlife,

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:04.560 align:middle line:84%
after this program those
doubts are all gone.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for watching
Beyond Belief.
